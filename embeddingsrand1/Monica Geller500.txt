Okay. I'm guessing that if you don't want to deliver, you probably don't want to pick stuff up either.
Was he crying?
God, Ross is on a date with your sister! How weird is that?!
Oh my God. Phoebe. Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.
Yes.
Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?
Can you believe it? I finally get to run my own kitchen!
Oh hi! Hi! Y'know, we were just talking about bacon.
okay, Pheebs, theyre gone.
Hm-hmm!
Why is everything different?
Rachel, you and Mark?!
Phoebe? Oh, Phoebe, I'm so sorry. Have you been here long?
Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?
No, but she likes me. You abandoned her on a plane to Greece.
Okay. Umm, y'know, I don't think, I don't think I told you this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship.
You promised Dr. Weinburg, you'd never use that phrase.
Rach! It's me! Pick up!
Judy.
Oh good.
Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!
All right, that I'll retract. But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasn't it. You're marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
We're good.
By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.
You'd better hope I don't see you in the hallway!!
Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!!
Oh, sure it does! In high school, you weren't jealous at all even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you!
Oh no sweetie, no! This is my fault, I wasn't clear! I'm really sorry. And listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? There's absolutely no rush.
Oh, you are so great! Thank you!
Well, who's voice was that?
Of course.
We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got cookie dough, we got Twister...
Okay. I-I can't watch.
Yeah, but without the costumes.
Uh, Ross.
I'm talking about me having a baby.
What?
Joey let me ask you a question. What does this light switch do?
Whatever.
Shoot, I think I got mayonaise on you.
All right, I...I have to ask.
Great!
Then I've gotta go. Bye.
Ahh, Pete, the other day when you said you needed to talk, umm, just so I know, is it good news or bad news.
Chandler what do you say?
Here you go sweetie.
Mr. Heckles.
Oh, that's great!!
I'm not crying about that! I'm crying about something that happened at work.
Ross, you've got to do something about the humping.
What for?
Oh, absolutely. Yeah, you know I'm not even thinking about that thing that we're not supposed to think about.
He loves you.
What? Why, why would...
Yeah!
Hello?
Why don't you phase it out? Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you're, y'know, that you're adjusting to life in America.
We have one.
Nestle Tollhouse?!
All right everybody, this turkey is ready!
Hello? Yeah, hi! Mrs. Tribbiani? Hi, this is Monica Geller. Yeah I'm just calling to say that Chandler and I uh, really hope you can make it to the wedding. Yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that we sent weren't delivered. Umm, I guess there was some screw up at the damn post office! T-Tell me about it! Yeah, yeah, the US Post Office? No, more like US lost office! What are they Irish?!
Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?
Oh no, two days, you must be bummed.
Joey!
What?!! Gross!!
Oh. Well, I didn't realize that you needed it back right away. I mean, you told me to go and be a caterer. So I went. I beed. I mean, I... I used it to buy all this stuff. But look-I've got another job tomorrow, so I'll pay you back with the money I make from that.
What did you do to his sweater vests?
No, although now that's what I'm thinking.
Gunther, can I get a coffee to go?
Ooh, umm, oh Kathy! Kathy, I love you! Oh!
What is going on with you?
You can't fire me. I make your decisions and I say, "I'm not fired!" Ha!
Chandler one time wore my underwear to work!
Chandler stole a twenty from my purse!
Great.
I so wanna be attracted to you.
Mine? Right here?
You are so handsome! I wanna make love to you right here, right now!
Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you!
Phoebe, why is smoke coming out of the bathroom?!
Hey. It's him. Who is it?
Upstairs in the bathroom right before you felt up mom.
No, you are not. We tell you stuff.
You changed?
So she's a woman! So what?
Okay! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, we're gonna start with...
Okay, here's your milk. What do you want to talk about?
Those cute little black ones I wear all the time.
OK, um. Goodbye.
Okay.
Oh no!
Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!
Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?
Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings.
Just mine?
Absolutely.
This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week.
I'm fine.
Are these the shoes?
Hey!
How?
Really?! How much?!
Make a wish?
It's weird, but you know what I don't wanna throw this away. I mean this is like all I have left of him, gross, drain hair. Ooh!
Unless...
Oh my God! Well push it in! Push it in!
Really?!
Phoebe.
All right, I'll see you guys later.
Well, thanks anyway.
No, Ross, we do not hate Emily. We-we just, we just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.
Hello?
Phoebe, you have to lift it and point.
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.
You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that he's a-a complex fellow who's unlikely to take a wife! That-that he's against marriage and always will be!
Oh, I like Elizabeth.
I need more swordfish. Can you get me some more swordfish?
Well you did a little bit.
Oh.
What's wrong Phoebe?
Ohh!
And who pays for that?
Great!
Hello Dan! I'm really looking forward to Saturday night! Really, really!
So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?
Would you slap me? Would you slap me right here in the face?!
Have you seen Chandler?!
Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big...
No that's, that's okay.
Um, and, well there's the.. the the small matter of...
Wait, we're supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer.
And so, we're hiding in the bathroom.
It's okay. It's okay. Just pretend that it didn't happen! Okay? No one needs to know! I mean, Phoebe's not an official ballplayer! I mean, only official ballplayers can drop the ball!
Wow, is that Michelle?
Chandler, for so long I...I wondered if I would ever find my prince, my soul mate. Then three years ago, at another wedding I turned to a friend for comfort. And in stead, I found everything that I'd ever been looking for my whole life. And now...here we are...with our future before us...and I only want to spend it with you, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. Unless you don't want to. You go!
Give it to me.
Whaaat!
Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah!
That's right, she came back all by herself.
Hey!
You look good!
Hi.
Yeah!
Hey, Joey, I don't think that you should leave Chandler alone. I mean it's only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishing next week?
Phoebe! You're sick, you shouldn't play. You should just go home, get in bed, and stay there.
Nooo!
Thank you soo, much.
Alright, I'll tell you what. I'll come get you in 5 minutes with some sort of um, kabob emergency.
NO!!!
Where were you? We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?
And I'm going to go get drunk.
All right, check me out.
Ross you know that tonight is your date with Hillary?
Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win.
Are you kidding?! I get a Porsche and the barca lounger's gone?! This is the best day ever!
Used to work with her. Used to! I'm a relative and I didn't get invited! A blood relative! Blood!!
Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass.
Okay, good luck!
Congratulations, I think youve found the worlds thinnest argument.
Carol moved her stuff out today.
Then why are you smoking?
Your boyfriend has been in there for over an hour. I can't believe it, it's like I'm living with him again. He's here when I go to sleep, he's here when I wake up, he's here when I want to use the shower, ughh. It's like I'm sixteen all over again .
Still crying?
Hi!
You just put an empty carton back in the fridge!
Well, uh, he's a doctor.
Okay, now you're even cuter!!
That's your call.
What do you have against the beautiful guest room?
I'm sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross.
I think he's shy.
I love you.
The Bible?!
Especially the after taste, you know, I'll tell ya, that'll last ya till Christmas.
Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice aren't they?
But why?! Did he get in touch with Emily?
Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really. Yeah, Ross is great. He's uh, he's in a whole other place. No, he's gone. No no, you don't have to fly back, really. What do you mean this might be your only chance? Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet.
I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.
You love me!
Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?
Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person. You're all going to hell.
Come on Rach, let's go.
Keep talkin'.
Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle?
God, you are so lucky. I mean, I mean. . . you know what I mean.
Oh my.
How would that go? Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it.
You didn't find her?
Did you like learn about her family?
Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?
Urghh!!
Please tell me you're stopping now.
Hi!
Ok...ay.
I know you're planning my surprise bridal shower.
It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.
There are no jobs. There are no jobs for me.
Come here, I want to show you something!
Weird, weird.
Oh that's so sweet! Look Chandler I don't care if you can't cry, I love you.
So are you ok?
Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half.
You become friends after?
Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a really stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows who she might end up hurting.
Look at these authentic fake medals. I tell ya, mom's gonna be voted best dressed at the make-believe military academy.
Okay, now Thanksgiving's over, let's get ready for Christmas. Who wants to go get a Christmas tree?!
How's it going?
Woo-hoo, geeek!
My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally.
Yeah! And the winner gets a hundred bucks.
You're his bitch.
Hold on.
That's my pie!
Marcel?
Really?!
Oh! You're awake!
All right, Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things. Now Phoebe, go tell the guys they have to help out!
Ethan, it's um... it's icky.
That's mine!! Now, would you both please start acting like adults? And get me my cough drops!
Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can't get out of!
What's to know? Buy sell, high low, bears bulls... Yes Manhattan...yeah telephone number of the stock...selling store.
It's some of Richard's hair! What do I do with this?
No-no, I-I really don't want to talk about it! I don't! Especially with you.
But no. Maybe if I were baking.
Uh-huh!
Does that smell bother you?
Please!
Inside of telling us you decided to write in your stupid book!
They're green?
This is so wild. Ya know, I gotta admit, I was kinda surprised that you agreed to go on a blind date.
Hey.
...horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.
Rachel said everything was okay.
Not any more!
Oh!!
Weren't you asked to leave sonny?
Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?
I can't do it. I'm sorry, I wish I could, but umm, see you have these feelings for me....
No no no no.
Which one was Pete Carney?
Go on.
Really?
Yeah... Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but haha, hey, that's me. Why don't you try the hummus?
That is sooo not true!
Because they don't know we're dating. Do you think we should eat in the kitchen?
Hello. Oh, hey Ross!
Give it to me.
Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?
Come on, okay, come on this is for all womankind. Let's kill 'um!
Oh my God! You still have the Chipper!
Aw, I'm sorry sweetie that she doesn't feel the same way.
Why not?
Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.
Dad, dad this is a good thing for me. Ya know, and you even said yourself, you've never seen Richard happier.
Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?
Stop it, stop it, stop it!
It's Danny.
You know what, I think it's cute, you trying to be more like Richard.
Chandler, please! Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey was not there that night?!
No. Um, I know you like this, and I want you to have it. I think it'll look good in our apartment.
Joey that is horriable.
Hey Rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less.
I don't know! Time to kiss a guy maybe?! What are you laughing at Pampers?
I'm afraid so.
Oh no, it is okay, I mean as long as you know that Chandler and I are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! I mean our flame, whew, is on fire!
I can't believe he did this.
Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!
Well, it's a set and they should probably stay together.
What are you talking about?
Here, take a couple of these.
No, I'll do it. You just stick to your job.
You love her!
Really?! You promise?
Ow! Ow! Ow!
But we can go, right?
So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don't really believe that do you?
Dr. Greene. Oh my God it's Rachel's dad. What're you doing here?
Hi.
Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!
Yes!!
Are you okay?
All right then, your bra would still be big.
Yeah.
'Dear Dr. Remore, know that I love you and would do anything to have you.' Gosh. 'Your not-so-secretive admirer, Erica Ford.' Ooh wait, 'PS enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.'
You don't want to know what tonight was.
Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man?
Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?
Oh! Him.
I can't believe you're dressing up for him. I mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again.
Wait a minute, I can get ice at the restaurant...
Okay!
I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one!
Are you okay?
Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? Y'know, just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats?
You want a problem? I'll give you a problem!
Danny. Are you guys ever gonna go out again?
Chandler!!
Yeah! Oh yes!
I can't believe her, y'know it's just-it's so typical.
Get in there man! Flirt back, mix it up!
She's leaving for three months.
No. I think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. I'm gonna get some tea.
Okay well I think...that's your answer.
But my apartment!
Phoebe!
Cute PJ's! You're really livin' it up here in London huh?
Hey, I went up.
Hey!
Well, what did you do?
You actually broke her watch? Wow! The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel.
Oh that's so sweet.
Bing's weird.
Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time. Maybe someday, there will be.
I wanna say good-bye at the car!
There's our star!
I think so too.
Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan.
What?! What honey?
Oh, she's gonna love that!
Viva Las Gaygas!
Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but
You didn't.
What?
Do you know what's a bad idea?
Y'know, there's a Starbucks about three blocks down.
Yes you did. You absolutely sold me...
I know you do. Me too. So what now?
What is wrong with you?!!!
Oh, So you can move them!
Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a whole new one because uh, you see, I-I, I put the wrong name again. 'cause um...
Are you scared?
Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.
..I dunno, a little too Alan?
And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!!
Hi Steve!
What? It's still going on.
Noooo! I'm lying. I am so drunk.
I know! Hey, you haven't been practising the routine, have you?
Awww, look at Aunt Monica's little boy!
Really?!
Are you serious?
Joey, take your time with that. That's my last batch.
So maybe we should just. . .
I missed you-you ugly, flat faced old freak!
Yeah you're right, we can't-we shouldn't watch this.
Well, she's not going to find them lying in the grass like that.
Hey, how long are you in the city?
So, how'd it go?
Let me ask you a question.
Oh, why? Why? What happened?
Who? Two divorces and Joey?!
It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left!
Because I don't have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. I mean there's no way.
I hope you're hungry, we're starting with oysters. And y'know what they say about oysters, don't you?
Yes.
Hey!
Thank you. Come meet my friends. This is uh, Phoebe.
Hi!
You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
Who? Is that your sister?
Here, let me try.
'Cause if you do that means you'd be cancelling it for me, and we're just friends.
Oh yes, it is. I'm sorry I borrowed it, I was cold. I hope its okay?
No-no, wait! Just let me finish, okay? This isn't something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. And it is going to happen.
I just told my Mom I'd cater a party for her.
What?
Look, all we're trying to say is, don't let what happened with Carol ruin what you got with Emily.
Hey!
I wanna wear this everyday.
No. I hate this part.
Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. Think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! Plus we get to have our own, ani-Vegas-ary! A-Nevadaversary!
Keep going.
Well, why don't we just bunny up.
You're on the phone!
Hi...May I help you?
Yeah sure, nature called, she wanted to see who else did.
Bye!
Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier.
What?
Alright, I'll give you the ear thing but don't you think the ending was pretty wonderful?
Joey... we always know what you mean.
Really?
I know.
Sweety, what are you talking about?
He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!
Yeah, good for you. Y'know you're tough, you lived on the streets.
Hey!
Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey. Have you seen it?
What?
Hah!
Relax. Y'know, she may not even know.
Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.
No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? I mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day. Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in! What's he gonna do? Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! I mean, who would do that?! Okay, fine, all right, but that's y'know, it's different! Although it did involve a lot of the same people.
No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean the chance to star in a movie? Come on!
No!
Really?!
So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?
Welcome to our side of the tunnel.
Shh!! Wait, what?
You stink!
OK.
Dad! There's Ross , why don't you go talk to him?
Okay, fine but please don't be upset! Okay? I was really depressed okay? And really drunk! I just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just wanted...just sex. So, when I...went to your room that night...I was actually looking...for Joey.
Oh.
Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?
Clogs.
Oh God! I gotta go!
That's okay.
And Mindy, your maid of...?
And you're cute too.
No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa.... And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Y'know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.
Hey Rach, remember that great song, Me, Myself, and I?
Really?
No, no, I don't.
What?
What's tonight?
What's with the guitar?
Hey dad, what's up? Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.
Yes!!
Because, you were mean to me and you, you teased me and you always, always got your way.
They baked it. I can't take this anymore. I'm gonna call a meeting tonight, I'm gonna fire you tonight.
Phoebe, stop writing about us!
Can I ask you a question?
Well, she saw the ring.
That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.
How'd you pay for them?
Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens. But actually, she should be here by now.
All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food.
Oh, sweetie!
Ross this is the only thing left that has a shot at working.
That you're a liar.
Phoebe, I'm engaged!
You were the next caller five hours ago. You must be going crazy.
Well, I was having a conversation.
Yes! Okay! Okay! Wait-wait-wait!
You want some help with that?
What?!
Oh my God! Fog him! Fog him!
Janice?!
So Chandler, I guess I'll see you at dinner.
Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.
Oh, you look so great.
Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can.
Easy Rach, we'll find it. Won't we!
you don't have insurance?
Yes!
Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
Fine, I'll rub it on myself.
I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. You know, I say we blow off the dates.
The ones we had right after you almost threw up.
No you're not.
Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive.
No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
Wait, wait, wait!
Hey, are we still on for tonight?
Okay, if you really wanna have sex...
They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?
Yeah!
Rachel!! Come on! Let me in!
Rach, are you really gonna let him do this?
Oh, god... She's told you that already, didn't she?!
1250.
Are you kidding me?! Is this; is this turning you on?
Oh my God! Oh my God! You have to go!
Well there's not much we can do.
Come on!
Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
Woah, woah, woah, let's go back to 29.
Hey guys! You found the presents? Chandler, you let them find the presents? Great! Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?
They'r alright.
No, that is what the game is.
You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?
You look cute in bubbles.
Y'know what's weird?
I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.
Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.
I need to get some Richard.
You really think this is okay?
Jeffery.
You are?
What was it for?
What are you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium!
Really!
Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.
I can't go to lunch!!
What?!
No it's not! You want it, you're gonna have to win it!
Oh, this is so great.
Oh, just do it!!
Joey?! Oh my God, Rachel!
And you know what? We want a rematch.
No it's not! No! No! Now it's about you and Ross getting back together!
I also, did a little something in fur. But umm, that's really just for me. Okay. So, why don't you go into your room and try these on and we'll see-get a better idea of what's gonna work.
Who has her own little desk when Roland's not there.
Ahhh! You are on my list.
Okay.
Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card people.
What-what are you doing?
Alright, Cincinnati, no blinds, everybody ante.
