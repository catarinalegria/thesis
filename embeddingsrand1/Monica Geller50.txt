This is my dress!
Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time to get a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to London, there could be a line at customs! Come on!!
All right, that's a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus, umm y'know what I thought we would start out with Tuscan style finger food, and for music, here's an alphabetized list of all my CDs! I've highlighted the ones that would go really good with the food.
Oh my God!
I'm sorry, okay? It just-tonight was supposed to be y'know, it was supposed to be a big deal.
Chandler! What are you doing here?
Okay.
Score!! 7 to nothing!
Well, I'd like to but, I'm not sure we have time to go.
What the hell happened?!
I can do that!
Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can't get out of!
What are you doing?
Just go.
I don't know, my hand feels weird. I guess it's because, I'm engaged! How long before it starts getting annoying?
Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?
Okay. Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
No, that is what the game is.
Oh well, where is he?!
Um-mm.
Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!
No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!
Cute PJ's! You're really livin' it up here in London huh?
Hey, are you okay?
Good, they feel good, in my head.
Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.
That's probably what they'll say.
Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can't eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.
Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be so terrible? Even if we were friends who lived together. Or, maybe someday friends who stood up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever.
Ah, the other Jack.
Sorry.
Hey!
Hey, you know I got a question for ya. Just a little thing, no pressure.
So look umm, while we're st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right?
Nothing, I just heard something nice about you.
Ow!! Ow!!
Oh my God! Well push it in! Push it in!
All right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and we're down by two points. Two points.... Phoebe you do a button-hook again. Rachel, you go long.
Curry.
Phoebe, relax none of that stuff ever happens! They just put it on there for legal reasons!
I don't know.
Okay. So, which boxes are mine?
Damnit! Y'know this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and, and no one was watching Chandler!
Alright, you know what? That's it. You've had your chance.
I'm fine.
Really? I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. You're gonna have to figure this one for yourself. All right? Y'know what? If you're too afraid to be in a real relationship, then don't be in one.
This is so wild. Ya know, I gotta admit, I was kinda surprised that you agreed to go on a blind date.
All right, be my guest.
I heard that!
Yeah-Oh that's right. You, you always wanted me too. Hey, I see you got your mustache back.
