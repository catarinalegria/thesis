Carol...Lesbian?
What was that?
Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
Ohh! Right! Right, sorry, I'll be right back!
Just washing the windshield.
Okay.
God, I am so glad you don't have a problem with this, because if you did, I wouldn't even consider applying.
What? Come on, it's not like I'm asking for this girly clock or anything, which, by the way, I also think is very cool.
Yeah but, my assistant Tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch. Ohh! I could just spread him on a cracker.
Y'know, I-I gotta tell ya, those eye drops are a miracle. My eye is a 100% better.
Joey, y'know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.
Oh yeah.
Well, I-I guess-I...
What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice! Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesn't, and if you have to even think about it...
Well, thank you, Melanie.
Oh-ho!
Oh-oh-oh, he's a transponce-transpondster!
What'cha gonna' do?
Ross is on a date with my sister and they shut the drapes two and a-half-hours ago.
No!
Awww...
That's great!
So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up, so Ross selflessly, offered to take me.
Wh?!
Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him. Now honey, you take care, you don't have those babies until I get back.
Oh Ross, you're so great.
Okay.
Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here!
Yeah, fair enough.
Joey is says Best Supporting Actress!
Come on you guys! Listen, if Emily knew I was here having dinner you with you she would flip out and you know it. It's okay, I really... I don't mind.
Well, because she loves you and because you love her.
Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.
Oh my God! We have to throw her a shower?!
So Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
Hey. Whe-ell, look at you, finally got that time machine workin' huh?
What?!
Oh. Stop it!
Oh.
Oh wow! This is so cool.
Oh, yeah sure, Ok.
No-no! Don't dance for me! Please? Don't! What is the matter with you guys?
OK, well, bye.
Well, that shouldn't be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.
Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey.
Mom, would you relax. That was 10 blocks from here and, the, the woman was walking alone at night, I would never do that. Mom, c'mon, stop worrying. This is a safe street, this is a safe building, there's nothing OH MY GOOOD, oh my God, oh I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go. OK, that's fine, you just read the paper, I'm gonna get a pot, it's not for you. OK, that's fine, read the Family Circus, enjoy the gentle comedy. Aaahh, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, aaaaahh. It's open you guys.
Well, can I keep the presents and still be 29?
All right, first name on the speed dial is mom.
With my sister Jill and my ex-boyfriend Ross?
Oh-oh, sorry, it's this way, it's this way.
No, that was his costume. See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist.
Eww!
Apartment pants?
Oh, sorry. I meant Chandler.
Yeah, yeah and you know what, I know she's gonna wanna run again, I just don't know how to get out of it, I mean, I live with her.
Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm gonna go use Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom.
What?! She made the tea!
Oh honey, but it is just about...
Since when?
Okay honey, now I'm gonna try to listen from right here!
You found me a guy?
Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?
Yep!
I know.
Hi!
Hey.
What the hell was that?!
And hey! Just so you know, it's not that common! It doesn't happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!
Honey, I'm sorry.
What handsome is not your type? Smart? Kind? Good kisser? What those things aren't on your list? Ross is a great guy! You would be lucky to be with him!
Yeah. So Frank, three babies. Whew, that just seems like a lot, huh?
Hey.
Yeah. I'm-I'm telling you he's really sweet and he's really funny and he's just ugh, got a good heart. And besides, I y'know, I think he really likes you.
Yes, we do.
Ok.
Ok, I've got one. Wow, those things almost never come true.
Yeah, that didn't work.
Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up!
Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him.
No! Not at all!
But ah, you're safe from it if it's in the freezer?
Hormones!
No.
You have a roommate?!
Oh. Oh, that's great!
Yeah!
Y'know who doesn't even like dirty movies? My new boyfriend Joshua.
There it is.
I'm just cleaning up.
Why not?
Oops sorry, my mistake.
Why, does she have a bad personality?
And you're no friend to those with noses.
When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rock bottom. But today, it's like there's rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, then me.
Well y'know, I don't want you to be cold.
What?! What?!
Some uh, some visual aides.
Oh, and then, we got into this big, stupid fight. I just, it was awful. I told him he treats me like a park ranger, or something, oh and then I told him I wanted to take a break, I don't want to take a break.
Oh.
Okay.
Well Joey, you'll probably get it. But you should probably your-your gracious loser face. Y'know when like the cameras are on you and you wanna look disappointed but also that your colleague deserved to win. Y'know? So it's sorta like...
Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to this?
Yeah. That's Daddy.
Charming.
Gimme an 'I!'
Hi!
Just once!
Okay!
Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.
He got it a flea market!
I didn't. I got under him.
Yes. You're not asking are you?
I know you did! I bought the same one! And if she sees your table she's gonna know that I lied to her. I told her ours was an original.
Hey!
Okay, now that is the third time someone has said something like that to me today.
God I'm just a horrible person.
Hey, listen umm, what-what are you doing tonight?
Well isn't it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy and that I can get a lot of use out of?
Oohhh.
Oh! Well let's look for them. Oh-oh-hey! Are these them?
What? You didn't get one.
Oh Monica, we are so sorry.
Joey, what are you doing with the bag? You're audition is not until tomorrow.
No, no don't get mad because look-this is what happened. So I-I started packing, then I realized, "What am I doing? I am lousy at packing!" Right? But you love packing! So, as a gift to you, on our last night, ta-da!
Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!
I'll be out in a second.
Oh no-no-no-no-no, no, no! We, you with someone and me with someone.
What?! Why?!
Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!
Well, we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys used for catering and we realised...
Ooh, so cute, that I'm thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.
Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend!
BACK OFF!!! Get up! Get up! Get up! God damn it! Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!!
Yeah? I'm sorry about your girlfriend.
Yeah but, you don't, you don't, you don't want to try to much too fast. Y'know? I mean, you do remember what happened to the little girl that tried to much too fast don't you?
OK, sorry to break up this party, but I've got resumes to fax before work tomorrow...
Here we go. I'm serving my last cup of coffee. There you go. Enjoy.
Horrible and degrading list of reasons not to be with me?
Sure we should... So.
Yeah! His name is um, Mark something.
Wow.
I don't know! He hasn't called me since that one time when we went out. I see him in the hallway, we flirt, I'm all ha-ha-ha-ha, and nothing.
Agh, what a jerk. I kept talking about you and he kept asking me out. I mean, naturally, you know, I said no.
Okay. Uhh, Ross, y'know what, there's something that I-that I have to talk to you about and everybody's saying that I shouldn't tell you, but I think they're wrong. I mean, and you know how people can be wrong.
Oh no, not in my room! I'll get him.
Please, no, go, that'd be fine!
That's easy for you to say, you weren't almost just killed.
Now I'm mommy in this little play? Alright look, I refuse to get sucked into this like, weird little Geller dimension thing OK. So I'm gonna go and take a nice long hot bubble bath because you kids are driving me crazy.
Oh... I'm sorry. I... I-I don't mean-I didn't mean to stifle you. I... This is all just a little overwhelming.
Why on earth would I understand this?
OK, Ross, listen to me, I am not yours to save.
Oh yeah. Well, at least I wasn't too chicken to tell some guy I thought he was cute.
There's nobody here!
Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. I'm just gonna throw it out, it's probably just a bunch of shampoo and...
Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs...
Ugh.
Honey, y'know I just gotta tell you, I think this is such a terrific thing you're having these babies for Frank and Alice.
Because he's stealing from me!
Yeah, 15 hundred dollars.
Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him-
But you-you said black. Why would he want his blue blazer black?
Oh really? Like what Monica?
Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the. . .
Okay, well, I'm gonna clear out some of these boxes.

Hi.
Oh my God!!! Ross!!

Hang in there. You hang in there.
Hi!
Oh, wait and on the nineteenth a secret crush announces itself.
No, I-I live with Phoebe. I mean you're alone, alone. And I just-it's just not the time for us. I'm sorry.
I don't want you to see me naked!
What? Wait, what?
This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this?
Well, we never actually got to dinner.
Oh, umm, I was just y'know working out and umm... Oh, that's it.
Well no brush!
Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place.
No! You gotta hold my hand!!
What?
Allison's birthday party.
Really. Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better, when I was engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too.
Well then I demand a recount!
Ohh! Oh God!
Oh Ross you're so tense! You just gotta relax okay? Just need to relax all right? Just need to relax...
Hi.
Ross, there is no us, OK.
Okay. So, can I serve you a little of-What? What? What?
Then what's with all the bananas?
OK, ready when you are.
No! Wait! Wait-wait! Ross, please!
Yes, absolutely. I would wait and wait. . . then I'd wait some more.
Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um, second of all , what?
Thank you. Mon?
Men just take out wind?
No. No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell. Andie McDowell is the guy from Planet of the Apes.
Oh, that is so sweet!
And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.
You have been maid of honor before?!!
Oh yeah? Startin' to feel her again there are we?
Yeah?
Gooood morning!!

Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!
Okay. Okay, see? I get the phone.

Well, then can we meet him?
Well, whaddya think?
Richard? I'm not gonna go see your ex-boyfriend!
And she's not crazy?
Hey!
You had to do it, didn't you? You couldn't just leave it alone.
Oh it was great! It was great! I went down there just like you said, y'know? And we talked business. Kim totally took my opinions.
Oh my God.
Gunther, Gunther, please, I've worked here for two and a half years, I know the empty trays go over there.
You know what?
Oh my God!
Let me finish.
Is Ross here?
Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
Yeah, kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of ya!
Oh, I know, I know.
Monica! Come on!
Ahh, hi! Hi! Melissa, what's up? I'm just uh, about to umm, go out to the store to get some stuff to put in my backpack. Y'know, like dried fruit and granola and stuff. What's up?
Well, I'll be waiting for you, just come up when you're done.
Oh wow!
Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.
Uh-huh.
Thanks, you can just put it on the table.
I don't know... sometimes it doesn't.
Oh. Oh, those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything.
What? C'mon you guys, I don't care, I have a date tonight.
Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!
At the Copa, Copa Cabana The hottest spot north of Havana. At the Copa, Coo-pa Ca-ban-a, music and fashion were always the passion, at the Copa....
Rachel...
Sure. You got it. Great!
How did this happen?
Why would a charity give away a free boat?!
What?
Oh honey, I'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're cuddlily sleepers. Okay, I'm late for work.
Anyway, um, I guess this belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me.
Hey Pheebs, you're still alive! How are you doing?
Hey! What's goin' on?
Ow! Ow!
Goodnight.
Yeah, I just have to get dressed.
Ohhh, I-I would enjoy that!
What?
You will like it!
What thing? What thing?
Ross!
Oh, well drop and give me ten more!
Uh yes, heroin and crack.
We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.
Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?
They had to reduce it because of, of my deviated septum.
Ross, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we've been dating for six weeks.
Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question?
Really?
Well there's yore. And uh, y'know, yesteryear.
Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, she's gonna get over this, y'know? I mean, so you said my name! Y'know you just said it 'cause you saw me there, if you'd have seen a circus freak, you would've said, "I take thee circus freak." Y'know, it didn't mean anything, it's just a mistake. It didn't mean anything. Right?
Yeah?
I guess.
You see, now, I would date this girl. She's cute, she's outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. I mean, that's got to come in handy
What? Yeti-I mean Danny?
No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.
Yeah, looks that way. First ones here! Wooo!!
Ok?
Shut up.
Hey! Hey!
So, I still have boxes here. I still have boxes at Ross's, and I have nowhere to live! Wow. I could so easily freak out right now.
Nothing! You go!
OK, listen, I'm sorry about last night and I really want to make it up to you.
Ohhh, this is the least jealous I've ever been!
You didn't break up with that fireman?
Phoebe?
You really think it would be that different?
I don't know.
But I...
But, it's not raining.
Unbelievable.
It just might be too hard, given the history and all that...
Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me.
Ohhhhh. That's how it got fixed!
Really?!
So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?
Nobody.
Hi!
Close call day.
Well...
Hi! I'm Rachel. This is Phoebe. I'm the maid of honor. How do you know Monica?
DANGER!!!!!
I don't know, I, I feel like I had a dream about you last night but I, I don't remember.
What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.
Thank you. OK. Machine. Just waiting for the beep.
Who are you supposed to be?
No-no-no! This chair's not going anywhere.
Wow, that's great Ross, I'm sorry we weren't more supportive before.
Wait! No, that's ridiculous. Come on, he lives three blocks away!
Well, so then what are you doing to me? Okay? Just get out of here! All right? Move on!
Well how can that be, you were just kissing Sabrina?
Please. If she said to you, "Ross, I want you on this couch, right here, right now," what would you say?
Hey! You guys umm, I want you to meet Sebastian.
What's that song? It has been in my head all day long.
Well what if I told you, you can do it in my apartment?
Well, y'know what? Actually, I was about to bid on this lovely trip to Paris.
Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole "seizing" thing but um, Emily called you today.
Would you let me talk.
Really? Who would, who would you marry?
Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument.
Honey see, it doesn't mean that I don't love you. Because I do. I love you, I love you so much. But my work it's-it's for me y'know, I'm out there, on my own, and I'm doing it and it's scary but I love it, because it's mine. I, but, I mean is that okay?
Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.
Oh my God! It sure didn't look this way when I lived here.
I don't know, I don't know.
Oh it's umm, it's tofu cake. Do you want some?
This Alan again? How's it goin'?
I know. I know. Oh God. There's no tissue! Can you grab me some toilet paper?
Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written. No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a writer.
Wow! I don't know if I could ever do that. I always figured the first time I had a baby was with somebody I love and that baby would be a...keeper.
Me neither.
That sounds great! I'd love to live at Warren's!! I love Warren! Thank you!
No, no, thats OK. Y'know, I think I'm gonna give it a go.
Thank God.
Okay.
I'm just kidding too. I'm getting married in December.
Look, Chandler, he has moved on, OK, you have to too.
What?
Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.
And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!
Oh, I can't believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers.
Oh, gosh, it's hot in here.
Pretty much.
I mean, this is unbelievable.
What?!
Yeah?
Daddy... Daddy... Daddy, why whyyy would I sleep with Billy Dreskin? His father tried to put you out of business! ...dead!
Oh, I can not believe you didn't tell me!
Well y'know what they say, the 23rd time's the charm. Aww, look at you all handsome!
No! I'm sorry, honey, it's just that last week I got all but three answers and I really want to finish a whole one without any help.
Ross, you know what...
Country club newsletter. My mother sends me the engagement notices for 'inspiration.' Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Barry and Mindy!
No, hey, come on, if he asked you first, that's only fair.
What?!
Yes, his name is Barry, he's a doctor, thank you very much.
Pretty uhm, different huh?
Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.
Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe.
Oh, right, clink.
No!
Oh hell, he's done this three times! He knows what its about!
Hey!
What?
Care for a cherry?
Joey, you have got to take this back!
Ha!
Oooh!
Oh, sorry.
Oh, Danny just went into room 217.
Hey!
Well no, I don't smell anything.
Yes, I do.
Funny book?
Yeah! Are you kiddin'?
You know what honey, you go ahead, we'll call her an alternate.
Hi. Sorry, things aren't working out so well.
Well, I-I'm startin' too.
"Oh my God, I can't find a boyfriend! So I guess I'll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!"
Yeah, well, you uh, better make it for three.
Well, I was thinking maybe a um, a romantic dinner with um, candles and wine and then uh, maybe going back to my place for um, dessert.
I knew.
All right! Who's are they? Who's are they?
I'm funny? Oh thank God! Well hey, I've got a ton of these! Umm, oh hear-Do you want a good one? Here's a good one. Umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge. Right? And then you say to person, I bet you can't roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face. And then when they do it, they're left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face.
Yeah, you bet.
No! Oh what does he know! Come on Rosita, us chichas got to stick together! You bitch!
What?
I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents? Why do they have to become people? Why do they have... Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?
Yeah, I know... ..I'm I'm just not that bright either.
Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye.
All right, we've got to tell her he's gone.
Well look, if you don't like this...
Come on, this isn't funny. She thinks it's my fault that you haven't called her. You have to call her!
When did you go to a sperm bank?
Okay.
Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.
Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?
Yeah.
No, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking.
Ugh! I cannot believe Chip dumped me for that slut Nancy Branson. I am never going out with him again. I don't care how much he begs!
Surprise me.
Umm.
I'm not saying that I'm a lesbian! I'm just saying that this happened!
Okay.
No.
Hey. Gosh, you look soo familiar.
Show time!
Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica's photo albums, I mean you don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks.
Phoebe, I'm going to Ross's wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable. Not because, I'm still in love with him! I mean, hey, y'know, I like Ross as much as the next guy, y'know? Clearly I have feelings for him, but feelings don't mean love! I mean, I still have loving feelings for Ross. Yeah! But, I have, I have continuing feelings of love, but that doesn't mean that-that I'm still in love with him. Y'know? I-I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love him-Ohh! Oh my God! Oh my-why didn't you tell me?!!
I'm serious, I really, I think I need just to have some...meaningless, sex y'know, with the next guy that I see.
Whoa, that Diet Coke just went straight to my head! Woo!
No. I have got to get ready and go to a dinner at my bosses house. It's a very big deal, there's a lot of people there I have to meet.
Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!
Turned out it was a hat.
Oh. Oh!
We just uh, we just met at the newsstand. We both grabbed for the last Field & Stream. What? I read that.
Yes!
Oh, go on! You telling people about me?
All right, I'm outta here!
Oh! What a great way to earn some extra pocket money.
Joey! It is an auction! You don't guess, you buy!
Hey!
Hey!
Of course I clean it. I mean, I,I will cleeeean it. I mean, I will cleeeean it.
Yeah! Right! Okay, I'll see you guys later. Woo hoo!
God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have got to get my license renewed.
Ow!
Since when, since when do you think I don't wear enough of this?
Oh, hi!
Oh, y'know what? That was a complete misunderstanding!
Um. yeah.
Yeah, so?
Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking. This is actually the smell of success.
Oh is it?! Uhh, hello? Yes hi, is Rachel there? Yes she is, just one moment please. It's for me!
Really?!
We won. We won!
Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!! Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey! Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just-y'know-stop it!
Y'know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding, it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.
Well, I told him I would think about it, but I'm gonna tell him no.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh God.
Okay..Okay.. Look. I'm sorry that I lied to you before. You were right. Ralph and I were an item but were not anymore.
Really?
Well, I was gonna let you play with it.
Hey.
Y'know Ross why don't you put that on your answering machine!
I know...
Let me get my coat.
What?!
What?
I love how he cares so much about stuff. If I squint I can pretend he's Alan Alda.
Yeah, ohh! Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth? I have a crush on you; I am attracted to you. Gee, I-I know that I freaked him out
No that could kill her.
Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her.
You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!
Was she good?
Oh my God! Why is he jumping on those women!
Then, no.
Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's the difference!
I mean if you think about it, I mean Ross did learn something from each marriage.
Yeah. Yeah, and y'know you-you deserve to win. And-and y'know I was thinking about it, if-if you're Monica's maid of honor that means I get to be yours.
Stop it! Cut it out! Cut it out!
Oh, yeah.
Blow it.
Really?!
Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend.
All right. Fine.
Hey, Pheebs!
Yeah, we found them. There were in the guest room closet behind some coats.
Ross!
Oh, hey, don't you have to go pick up Emily?
Oh Ross, you're so great!
Wow.
Oh no! No! No-no-no-no! No, I mean come on that's-that's crazy-I mean that's crazy. So what's-what's going on with you? What is going on with you?
Ugh...
Oh, right! Wait a minute, I do that too.
Oh, thank you that's very helpful, I'm glad you came over.
Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house.
Okay, just give me the damn drops!
Oh my God, wait did I-I just said Greens don't quit didn't I? Did I just say Greens don't quit?!
Right!
Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal.
Well we're gonna miss you around here.
HEY!! Do you have to do that? It's Saturday!
What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He's Satan in a smock!
And while I'm gone don't you boys sneak a taste.
Monica.
Wow you, you. I had no idea.
Oh, my-my new assistant has very happy that I hired my new assistant.
Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I've ever heard.
Ross said my name. Okay? My name.
You have a son!
Oh. Yes! I would so move out!
Oh, come on! We know what these are worth.
Hello? Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you? Yes, yes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great. Really? Oh. Okay. Okay, well I'm working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can come by and... Okay... Great... Great... All right, so I'll, so I'll see you tomorrow! Okay.. Okay... Bye. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.
You don't want to work for a guy like that.
Phoebe's...
With my alignment. I've got one leg shorter than the other.
Oh I'm sorry, we're clo-... Hey sailor.
Ugh! Get out! Get out! Go! Come on! No! Not in there! He's in there!
Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?
Ah, first, I-I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again.
What?!
Monica's making jam.
What?
Hey-hey-hey that's funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy! You wanna know what else is really funny?!
Nope!
No, honey, they're not, but don't worry, because we are going to find them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok?
Oh come on Ross!!
I have absolutely no idea.
Because, he's my friend.
Hey!
Yes!
If anybody asks, I'm your sister, Joan. Listen. C'mon, you guys. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me!
I know, I know, I know, I know. I was just thinking about when they were there the last time, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. OK, OK, look, woah, I promise, I'm good, I'm not gonna laugh anymore. OK put your hands back there.
Oh, wait! Sorry, Mr. Paul? Mr. Paul?
Phoebe, don't you think you've had enough to drink?
Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone.
Really?!
Hi! Well, we were just about to take off and see a movie. Oh no!
Oh my God! You guys this is so great! I mean it's so unexpected! I mean Chandler's birthday is even before mine!
No. Why?
How is that the silver lining?
I won't boss you around.
Hello?! Oh, yeah! This is gonna be a while. Excuse me. Yeah!
Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming!!
Phoebe...
Two, two babies?
Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.
Happy birthday.
It-it did!
All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it ain't gonna happen!
Hey! Y'know what? You are in our apartment all the time! Okay? This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!
You all know? Does Ross know?
Oh! Hi you guys, oh my God! You'll never gonna believe happened to me today! I am sitting in my office and...
Yeah?
Were both of those Joey?
Okay.
What?!
Ross, would you just stop it! It's getting really old.
Not interested.
Mon. Hi!
Oh yeah surfer?
Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio!
Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anyway-umm, what is this book about?
What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?
Oh, ah nothin'. I just felt like hangin' out here and reading.
I don't know.
Want a wedding dress? Hardly used.
Well, y'know, the reason I didn't wanna go running with you is because um, well y'know the way that you run is a little...
Yeah, and you know what? You're right, I do feel better, thank you Ross.
Phoebe, I mean, you do know he's married?
So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?
No sorry hon, Monica's orders.
Yeah? You like that one?
No? So you're saying that if I called it, it wouldn't ring?
You know what?
Ohh...
Oh! Good thing Chandler's not here, he always wins at this game.
You remember Ross.
What?
Oh y'know what? Y'know what? Now that you know what you want you should go to Kleinman's and get it half off. This place is so overpriced.
I did but she doesn't think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.
Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later.
What-what, wait a minute, you don't think that's why he wants me back?
Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have got to tell you something!
How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest?
Well, we're a little early, the lecture doesn't end for 15 minutes.
It's not here Pheebs, it's not here. Ohh, I went to Joey and Chandler's last night! Okay!
Men are unbelievable.
OH MY GOD!!!
Hey Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
Oh God, absolutely.
Yes?!
What?! What else did he say?
Ohh, God.
And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!
Do you got your gracious loser face?
Would you like to go to a basketball game with me? You know, its funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets too... Umm, who likes the Knicks-
Yeah, don't push it though.
Hey!
They're in Vermont!! How could this happen?!
Pheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened!
No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different.
Handling it? What do you mean, handling it? There's nothing to handle. Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn't for me and Joshua. Y'know, they're not gonna get married anyway!
...if you tell me, I might do it.
Just get away from me!
Hey! We were not on a-Okay. That's fine! Fine. Y'know what Ben? One day when you are a lot older I am going to tell you that entire story over a pitcher of real margaritas, okay?
Bye Mon.
I almost caught that one!
Do you even understand what off the rack means?!
Okay.
Yeah, okay, I'll see you later.
Okay.
I think I just shipped 3,000 bras to personnel. Oh honey, I gotta go. Mark, I need you!
I don't know! I mean, we still care about each other. There's a history there. 'S'like you and Carol.
Oh my God!
Oh, I'm sorry. Ross Tillman.
Okay Ross, we're-wait a minute. Umm, I uh, I kinda have a little confession.
Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gonna look like a big marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I can't live on my own! I can't even do laundry!
Ooohhhh!!
Oh!
Oooooooooh. Oh, that's nice. Oh, oh. Huh, Ross!
Well, I feel fine, but I think you're bumming out the rest of the kids.
Oh honey, I'm so proud of you, Min.
Ahhhhh, salmon skin roll.
Yeah.
I didn't know you could get married here.
Good ones?
Oh! Did you hear that?! My dad's proud of me! My dad's proud of me.
No!
Joey, you can't let him get away with that. Ya know what, I'm not going to let him get away with that. I'm going to say something to him-No, I really shouldn't say anything-No, I should say something to him. Gunther, I want you to give Joey his job back. That is really not fair that you have to fire him...
I'm unpacking!
Well, I was gonna, but I accidentally read something else.
It's not random, it's Bob.
I care!
Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?
Well...
Right, yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors.
Come on, please?! I'm boredddd! You let me do it once before.
Umm, well let's see Monica and Chandler are occupied.
No.
Have at it.
Yeah, yeah, I was just about to take a break anyways, so...
I'm sorry your wife is gay. I guess women aren't that great either.
Okay, I do.
Why aren't you guys at the movie?
Oh my God Ross! What in heaven's name are you doing here?
I know, it's sick.
Thank you! You're great!
They're not true?
I'd do anything for you, you know that.
Okay, y'know what? We don't need her measurements.
I'm not vanilla! I've done lots of crazy things! I mean I got-I got drunk and married in Vegas!
Did we speak on the phone last night? Did you call me?
Ok, you know what, lemme, let me just see what else I can do. All right, look, look. Why don't you just let her go on after Stephanie whatever-her-name-is. I mean, you won't even be here. You don't pay her. It's not gonna cost you anything.
Oh yeah, I know, but the garbage was full.
Oh, no-no-no, no-no-no, it has become, it has-yeah. Oh no, those were four great dates.
Oh Mon, listen I have to ask! Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls?
Chandler!!
All right, fine. Um, you were not the only one there. Joey was there too.
I'm just bummed about the way I left things with Ross. I shouldn't have lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me.
Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry I forgot, she's not a lesbian.
Oh! Oh, I love that but.
I mean n-not-not fake at all like most famous people.
Yeah, I didn't want you to get hit by the boom!
Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right. I love you, but you're crazy.
Hi! I love you on that show! I watch you everyday! I mean, when you took out your own kidney to save your ex-wife even though she tired to kill you...
See?
Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! I'm leaving! You are just a horrible person!
Oh God, oh God, it's sowed on though.
Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?
Ohh, you can say. Come on, I don't want you to feel like you can't tell me things.
Ooh, I just feel bad, I never vacuum.
Oh, the guys are here.
Well! Is everybody else having just the best time?!
Time's up, now your dead.
Well, how can you be a tour guide, don't you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?
Ewwww!!
Thirty. Ugh, I mean thirty! Monica, do you remember mean, old Mrs. Kreeger in the fifth grade? She was thirty!
All right.
Okay. Okay!
Oh, Phoebe, that really cute guy is here again.
Phoebe? I'm sorry about the whole lifting out thing. You gotta come with me!
Yeah. Oh, yeah. And I mean, the connection, I mean y'know, emotionally, mentally, physically...
Oh my God, honey, I'm so sorry!
Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.
Ok, so Phoebe, now are you gonna call your dad and let him know that his dog is ok?
Oh God, oh, and then she told the funniest story...
What?!
I'm sorry!
Fine.
Okay, uhh, I think I'm going to run to the ladies room.
Alright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecoming queen and the class president and you... were also there! But if you take this monkey, I will lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him. C'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here! Take it!
All right, let's go!
I know.
Oh my God, Le Poo, our dog!
Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along. Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.
How have you never been on Oprah?
I'm sorry, sweetie.
Oh hey-hey wait! How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?
Oh no! No! It's actually-it's very sweet. It's very sweet. Look! Yeah, do you want it?
Oh so you know that, you guys talked about that, so you get along, so you think you're gonna go out?
Oh, look at me, look at me. Oh, I'm on a date with a really great guy, all I can think about is Ross and his cat and his... Julie. I just want to get over him. gosh, why can't I do that?
Hey.
No.
Because I'm going to London.
Yeah!
Yeah, sure?
I do the same thing.
With Ross and Jill?
Wait, I-I just said "leave."
Sorry!! I just feel bad about all that sleep you're gonna miss wishing you were with me!
No. A break from us.
No, I stuff outside the bra.
I think he's across the hall.
Hey.
Ohh we're not sailing.
Yeah...
Yeah.
Hey!
So I hear the Ralph Lauren fooled around with someone in the copy room.
Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, the caterers, the music...
God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was...
Tequila!!
What?
That's not European!
Wow, Monica, I love that, you really have faith in me. Thank you. Technical question, how do you know when uh, the butter's done?
Sucker!
Well okay-Well don't ruin it! Just play along at least!
Sure? Thanks.
What?!!
Well, who wouldn't?!
Okay, Pheebs, quick, what shoes should I wear? The black or the purple?
Ah, yeah!
Cool... "Urkel" in Spanish is "Urkel."
What, what incident?
Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's picture! This is so exciting!
Ask me what?
I can see that. I... just one phone call, I'll be very quick, I'll even pay for it myself. OK, you're bein' a little weird about your phone.
Oh, it's okay.
Yeah but, I've never asked a guy out before.
Yeah and we'll drop it off downstairs so that we're not tempted.
Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be there.
Ok honey, you really need a job.
I don't know. I know I don't work late tomorrow night.
Oh, really, let me see, let me see.
Really? Me?
OK, OK. I'm with you, Cheech. OK.
Oh oh oh, wait! You only got whipped cream in there! Ya gotta take a bite with all the layers!
What?
Thanks for lunch, Chandler. Y'know, you didn't have to walk me all the way back up here.
There he is!
You can't just say, 'Nice to meet you, good night?'
Oh totally, totally. Y'know it's not that big of deal, we already kinda did it once y'know.
Nah, uh, uh, uh, uh.
And Ross.
Uh, it's from yore. Like the days of yore. Y'know?
Goodnight.
Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi.
Joey, just-just he-he's new in town and I know he doesn't have any guy friends. Just take him to like a ball game or something. I'll really appreciate it.
And stop saying that! I hate that!
Just get out! Now!!
Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought.
Mom!
Because a car backfired?
Yes!! I mean sex does not have to be a big deal! There shouldn't be all this rules and restrictions! Y'know, people should be able to sleep with who ever they want, whenever...
I don't know. Y'know, they didn't get us anything.
What's going on?
Oh, no sit-ups today Tag?
Okay.
No, you don't, Ross. Imagine the worst things you think about yourself. Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you.
All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.
Oh my God! Oh, I cannot believe it!
Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee house, I'd be serving him sneezers.
Like what?
Ohhh.
Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.
That sounds great.
Honey, what are you doing? That's too heavy.
It's a uh, regatta gala.
Oh please, what do you know! You married a lesbian!
Yeah it is, it is. We really, really have to do something about that.
Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too?
Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left!
Ohh, I would love too.
Honey I swear it we just kissed.
Hi!
Shhhh!
Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don't wanna have to have a separate room for you too!!
Hey.
Well, ever since I was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends, I'm just, I don't know, not in a museum benefitty kind of mood.
Of course it's true and it hurts so bad.
I'd need an expense account.
Well, people are different.
Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.
Oh, he sees her!
What is this? What are we doing?
Well, you know I'm not surprised. I mean have you seen them together, they're really cute.
Joey, do you have a minute?
Oh, she wants to see me tomorrow...Oh, she sounded really weird, I gotta call Barry... Hi, it's me, I just.. Mindy!! Mindy! Hi! No, I figured that's where you'd be!
Oh-ohh, thank you.
In a month?
Oh my god. Oh my god. Excuse me. Move! Move! Emergency! Excuse me!
Afraid to ask him?
I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.
Ugh, she is a slut!
Well, what happened to your jam plan?
Hi you guys.
Oh Ross, come on! This is not, this is not a marriage!! This is the world's worst hangover! Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I will!
Ughhhh!! Forget it! This is, this is not how this is supposed to happen.
Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment? Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!
Now that you're on you're own, you're free to look as stupid as you like.
C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat.
So, if-if I mess this up, there's nothing else for dessert?
Oh my God!!
Would you guys stop.
I had a wedding.
Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh?
Yeah.
Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight. It's been kinda a long day.
Okay.
Yeah!!
I know, yeah, sorry.
Yeah, sure. All right, whose court is the ball in now?
Uh-huh.
Oh, yeah, sure, sure, sure, sure. Listen, can we please have lunch the next time I'm in the city?
Okay.
O-kay!! See what you did, I'm gonna be doing it by myself now. Okay?
Why? Is he? He is! Isn't he? He's dating that slut in marketing!
Just one cheek.
How are ya?
What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?
Yes, yes it is true. And I know this because, because he pretended to be Drake to, to sleep with me.
Ohh, I'm gonna have to get over it. God, see I didn't know that's I had to do, I just have to get over it.
Well, Ross, we were worried about you. We didn't know how you were going to react.
Hey.
I'm not gonna tell you, but if you found out on your own, that would be okay and then we could talk about it. Right?
Yeah, I can do that.
Oh it does, it does! It is a room separating apparatus from Colonial times.
Hey, did you guys check out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom?
Look, I know what's going on here, okay, Mark explained it all to me. He said this is what you guys do.
Ugh, those bastards! Let's go.
Was she good?
All right, you know what? I am not leaving here, until you call that plane back!!
Nothing.
Hmmm!
Cat! What'm I saying? Cat!
Ross?
Hey, Monica!
Aww.
No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us and she was all, "I'm Rachel Greep! I'm Rachel Greep!" and he let her right in.
Sure.
Hey, you.... So, what's up?
That's....
I can't kiss anyone.
Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let's talk about it!! How was she?
Hey!
Because, I can't! Ross, I told you, no. I can't.
And umm, vintage handkerchiefs y'know 'cause, people cry at weddings. I'm just gonna grab a couple of these.
Really! What is with that guy? I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you.
Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit! Y'know I just wish we could be like on a break!
Bye!
Hi.
Phoebe, we can't, we just can't just let it happen! Okay, we have to do something! We have to break them up! Okay? Just go in there and like, shave her head! You owe me one bald girl!!
Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them.
What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense!
...see I can't decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair, the Sahara desk, or the Parker console table.
Hey! Umm, do you guys have any juice?
Okay! Okay! Umm, Webster's Dictionary defines marriage as... Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay, never mind! Forget it! Umm, umm, okay, uh... I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six year old.
Oh thank you! Oh God! Can I have another one?
I can't believe Mark didn't call. It's Sunday night, and he didn't call.
Yeah!
I don't know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay? It's not a perfect world! Just go please.
No! Y'know what? No! No! You thing was so stupid anyway, this was ridiculous-We're gonna flip a coin! All right?! Heads!
: Sak's... Fifth... Avenue.
Yeah, we're gonna... we're gonna get some cake.
No, you're right. Well, we'll find something. Let's just get you out of that. Come on.
Oh, it's a Macy's bag!
So did you read your evaluation yet?
Oww!
Uh, well, I think, I think he broke up with me.
No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?
I bet you're a Gemini.
So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?
Barry who I almost.
Hey.
Uh, Joey..
Now, does it really matter?
Oh, what do you, you want me to stop seeing him, is that what you want?
Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can pass on my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the coffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right. A smile goes a long way. And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin.
Oh my God.
Ohh...
Ross, Chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he won't let me see.
No. No, not at all, not at all. I actually was gonna bring someone myself, so...
Honey that sounds like fun.
See your twenty-five...and...uh, Monica, get my purse.
Joey.
Wow. I, I don't even know what to say. Thank you.
You think you're gonna get out of this on a technicality?
Hey Mon, what are you doing now? Wanna come see a movie with us?
We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it's actually for Joshua. Look, he said he's not ready to date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I have the perfect opportunity to seduce him!
Ross gave it to me.
Yeah and honey I promise next time that I will just say good-bye and tell 'em you're not looking for a relationship.
Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help.
Ohh, are you setting Ross up with someone? Does she have a wedding dress?
Nooo!
Yeah.
Well, it's a long story, but umm I broke Joey's chair...
Well...
He's soo lucky, if Janice were a guy, she'd be sleeping with somebody else by now.
All right. Be sexy.
Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those? Y'know what, actually... Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?
I think he's stealing from me.
So you'll definitely get onstage, even if you don't win.
Oh yeah he's too cute to be straight.
Well, you're not totally paranoid.
Ok Ross, just so you know, calling it a poopie diaper doesn't make this process any cuter.
What?
It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.
Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and everything is changing.
No-no, they're not very nice people.
She could be out of town. Maybe she'll be gone for months.
You don't.
Okay, Pheebs, can I ask? So, hes going out with her. I mean, is it really so terrible?
I wrote you a letter.
You-you're not wearing a jacket.
Y'know what? I think we can just leave it at that. It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...
No! It didn't! That's what I want to talk to you about. Now, just to brief you... I may cry, but they are not tears of sadness or of anger, but just of me having this discussion with you.
What?!
Oh yeah? Another night of birdogging the chickas?
Oh, hi!
I got the job!
Well, y'know what though you guys? I really appreciate that but I think I'm just gonna take Sebastian to the charity.
Oh my God! Oh my God!! Ohh, Jessica Lockhart!! In my apartment!! I am such a huge fan! I am such a huge fan!
Ooh great! Very Monica.
Hi, Julie.
Really?
I'm sorry, Rosita? As in...
Do you?
No.
Oh yes, it's me! Sorry!
This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself reaching for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. You want her back you have to start acting aloof.
Do you remember where the duck food is?
Yeah! You-you got the job! You're my new assistant!
Take care.
I don't know!
Hi!
This is how I would hold a football.
Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27.
Who was that?
Ugh, Monica I don't want to steal your stupid thunder!
Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?
Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.
No-no, I'm staying put.
Oh, Ross, I'm sorry. I completely ruined your evening.
Yeah, oh wait!
Hey! Hey, cute jacket!
Oh c'mon Joey, we care about you.
You are asking me to be your wife!
No, you could've lost your job.
Anyway, I'm going to be the coordinator of the woman's collection, I'll work right under the director, it's the perfect, perfect job for me!
Shoot, shoot, this is never gonna work! He's right there!
No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? Are people eating my dip?
Oo! When's her birthday?!
Okay, I'm sorry.
Right!
Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?!
I'm sorry. I didn't-I don't come in here a lot.
Well, then, I guess that's the difference between us. See, I'd never make a list.
Okay, thank you. That'll be all. Wait! Wait! Did you see that? That mail guy had no idea there was something going on between us.
But don't you think Rosita would've wanted you to move on? I mean y'know, she did always put...your comfort first.
Ohh that's nice.
Ohh!!
Mindy, my maid of. Oh!
Really?
Well that works out good, because I'm not listening.
Ohhhh, sorry I missed that.
Yeah! Yeah. They're...they're-they're my friends, uh, Monica Stephanopolus and uh, and Chandler Acidofolus.
What?
What are you guys doing here?
Okay, very cute braces. Anyway y'know what, the point is Tag, start looking because you are going to find those contracts on your desk.
I'm not reading this!
Nooo! It's not okay! I can't believe you would want to after what he did to me!
I know. I'm sorry. Look, I'll make a deal with you all right? Okay?
Look at that! Look at that! We all do it. Okay, I'm stopping now.
Alimony.
I know, I can do more than cook.
Ok, doggie get the- aahhh. Ok go get the sandwich, get the sandwich doggie. Good doggie get the sandwich, get the...ok, Joey, the dog will lick himself but he will not touch your sandwich, what does that say?
Okay, I'll see you after the thing.
We're not?!
Wait-wait-wait, I just thought of another story about how nice Ross is!
Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God....
I cannot push it in!
Well, at first it was really intense, you know. And then, oh, god, and then we just sort of sunk into it.
Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My father's boat didn't make that much noise when it hit rocks!
Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.
You're twins?
Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn't a chair.
Well, that's great.
Hey, y'know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I hate being alone this time of year! Next thing you know it'll be Valentine's Day, then my birthday, then bang!-before you know it, they're lighting that damn tree again. Ohh, I want somebody! Y'know, I want a man!! I mean, it doesn't even have to be a big relationship, y'know, just like a fling would be great.
That is the Coast Guard.
Ohh wow! I'm sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!
See? I've even called Animal Control!
You'd be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me?
Okay, I need a, I need a drink!
Just a touch. Mon, I don't understand. I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms? I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh.
It's fine.
You have! Ross, you should give yourself credit. I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, "Once a cheater, always a cheater."
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. They used to live here; sometimes they migrate back over.
Well in High School, that added up to head cheerleader.
Oh. Right.
No! I'm so happy for them!
Aw, Mon...
Oh, but that's okay.
Sophisticated like a hooker?
I know. I always thought if you and I got married, it would be the one that stuck. And it wouldn't be a secret, and we wouldn't have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut.
Oh, you got me.
Does anybody need more coffee?
Hi Daddy!
I'll take all of your photos and put them into photo albums!
No!!
What?
Did you know he was in there?
Okay...
Yeah! Once, I figure out what I'm wearing.
Oh, God, no problem. So you're gonna go with the uh, waiting thing?
Ross kissed me.
Yeah that's actually a pretty good idea.
Oh, well, that shouldnt be so hard, now that youre dating. "Sweetheart, youre fired, but how bout a quickie before I go to work?"
Hey Mon? I'm gonna check my messages.
It's just some things I've been thinking about. Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff.
Great.
What!?
Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica's and she and Chandler had a big fight and they're not moving in.
Oh God I just can not imagine what is gonna happen if Chandler doesn't show up!
Oh, God.
Okay, y'know what? There's only one way I'm leaving this hotel room.
Well, they always called.
Why are- why are you so tanned?
Well, y'know I was thinking of moving the couch over here.
Okay, do you see, do you see what you're keeping me married too?!
It sure is.
Come on, show me.
Okay, now make it even, 'cause we don't...
Hey! That's just poking me in the eye!
Oh! I knew it! What happened?
..so, he said it was just a sprain, and that was it.
Okay! "Hello Ross, this is Dr. McNeeley from the Fake Accent University, we'd like you to come on board with us full time!
Yeah!
Yes, I'll meet 'em.
Phoebe!
Stop picturing it!!
Right! You're right!
Yeah Melissa, I don't want to be known as the uh, office bitch, but I will call your supervisor.
Every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother.
I'll get the hat.
Okay, well, we won that one.
We're the Cobras!
I'm so sorry! Are you okay?
Hey! We're here!
Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it.
Good different?
Ye-, no, my Uncle Hi.
So, uh, how was your day?
Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.
Sure.
Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend.
Are you serious?!
Oh! Y'know what? You're right! We meet, you flirted and then bamn nine years later you had me!
I don't gossip!
What? You're leaving?!
Yes! That I know, this is from White Plains.
Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?
Thank you.
We're paying for this y'know.
Bye-bye.
Hi!
We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
Hey!
I'm just making margaritas.
Whoa what?
Oh, thank you.
Oh, I don't know. I guess we have to eat.
Uh, to Stephanie Schiffer.
I don't know. The left one.
Wow! You certainly think a lot of yourself.
Does it?
Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings.
So wait, this guy goes down for like two years at a time?
I went really long.
Joey, you are not! You're 31.
Hey!
Oh, I don't know, I guess, Chris O'Donnel, John F. Kennedy, Jr., Daniel Day Lewis, Sting, and Parker Stevenson.
Yeah, come here!
So you're gonna be in the car, I will be upstairs, and that's where everybody's gonna be!
Ok, I, I will do your laundry for one month.
Well, I like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress.
I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming up- I wanted him to meet my family-
Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does. But I have to tell him how I feel! He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.
It was unbelievable!
We didn't change..
Yeah.
I promise.
Oh, come on! He's glad that I came, he doesn't want me to go anywhere, balls flying all over the place!
We... We are not... ...going to let it... be a problem.
Hi, Pheebs.
All right fine! You're not invited to the party we're gonna have either.
I really do.
Oh well then, so I'm just going to go back to talking to my friend here. And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.
You don't have any secrets!
Oh!! I love this job! Wow! My first call.
I had one.
Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!
Ohh, God! Look at him, he's so cute. I wanna go over there, grab him, and kiss him! How can I kiss him and not letting him know that I like him?
Thank you.
Uh-hmm.
No, I haven't had a chance to be alone with him yet.
Hey, how'd the interview go?
You got fired?!
Yeah.
Yes, I did. Thank you very much, it was excellent.
I don't know, I don't know.
Nooo!
Yeah, y'know what? Don't look at it. Seriously, don't look at it.
But you said that you liked him! I mean what happened?! Did ya just change your mind?!
Oh, okay, not so weird.
If we broke up, and I lost you...
Are you, are you, are you sure it's ah, a new bump? I mean, no offense, I've always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child.
Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.
No, I think that was the whole all.
Well yeah, I wish that you would. Well, no it's not in there! How about that drawer?
None.
And everybody knows this?
No don't! Go back to repeating!
Chandler, what are you doing?
Yeah, I mean, you know it, I mean, if it were me I, I, you know, I'd want you to, I don't know, like catch me off guard, you know, with like a really good kiss, you know really, sort of um, soft at first, then maybe um brush the hair away from my face, and look far into my eyes in a way that let's me know that something amazing is about to happen.
Oh yay!
More than jewelry.
What's goin' on?
I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that.
May fifth, why?
Hey!
Okay, swear you won't tell, but when Mark left he gave me a key to Joanna's office. Do you wanna see the list?
Hey.
Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.
Oh, well okay. Well, there you go.
That is so sad. Your missing out on so much, Ross. I mean, the bonding and the sharing, you know. And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are.
Do you want me to quit?
I'm going for a walk.
Well, I should think so. You slept with someone.
So honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl?
What's that?
Well sure, if you say you're gonna take care of everything I have no reason to doubt you. Give me those forms! All right, now I'm gonna do this my way and I don't want to hear a peep out of you!
What's up?
Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it!
Great! It went great. Really great. Hey, is that wine?
Ohh, thank you.
Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up.
Well-well a little blind sided but y'know good.
Well, I'm sorry, I thought you needed them!
Well, what's the other thing, what do I think?
What?
Wait a minute, you're only giving free stuff away to the pretty girls?
Is that the heartbeat?
Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him.
Oh my God! Oh, that's funny, I can't believe I did that.
C'mon, you guys, what're we gonna do, what're we gonna do?
Like a little girl. I know. I know. I know. This is all my fault; I wanted him to open up. But God, I didn't know that I was gonna unleash this-this weepy, clingy, moist monster!
Hi, guys!
No, he said we were holding up the people behind us.
Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? I mean that ain't a pretty picture in the morning, y'know what I mean. That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know.
Who are you saying "check" too?
Already? That's pretty bad what you did.
Well, you were pretty damn good.
Um, what- what would make you think that?
Oh my God you're amazing! Did you just pull that out of her purse?
Oh no-no-no, no-no-no, that's not what I meant.
Good.
Ok.
He didn't turn me down! He's at the game isn't he? I got the date, I'm just not on it!
Yeah.
I'm just not going.
Wow. Is it, is it 'cause she's so cold in bed. Or, or is it 'cause she's like, kinda bossy, makes it feel like school?
Okay, umm, I'm gonna get my sweater.
His new girlfriend!
Get up!
Oh I don't know honey. It's gonna be really late.
Oh my God. Did you talk to him?
See ya.
Monica!
Oh, wait Joey! We fought the Nazis in World War II, not World War I.
Oh-oh Professor Geller.
Cupid.
Hel-lo, Rachel Green.
Ohh no you don't! You got lighting last time, lighting is mine!
Hey, I thought that guy was married.
Any luck?
Why the voice.
Oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do?
You fell asleep?!
Now just how big of a star is Marcel?
Y'know...
Hey guys! What's...
Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, I've known them separately and I've known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.
What do you mean you quit?! You can't quit!
You think?!
Oh my God!
I didn't know that.
Where did you get that?
Yay!
Oh no!
Jo-Joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? Umm, I kinda got the feeling from her today that uh, she's not lookin' for a serious relationship.
Wow, you guys, this is big.
Oh yeah, what's it about?
Don't do that.
And if you need anything else, I do not believe we've met. Hi. I'm, uh, Rachel Green. I'm Carol's... ex-husband's... sister's roommate.
I know.
Are you drunk?!
Yeah, that's true.
Whatever Linus, I'm opening mine.
What are you gonna do Pheebs?
You're bachelor pad?!
Well then uh, we better make this night count. Oh wait, I forgot to turn off the cappucino machine. Anchors away. Oh no no, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my pu rse. Oh, you know what. I forgot to turn off the bathroom light.
Cappuccino.
Really.
Huh.
Oh, I'm sorry, I guess I just bring it out in him.
Sorry I'm late, but I left late.
No, absolutely. Y'know like it was umm...
Then why do you ask?!
Well, I'm really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that is going to help you quit.
Oh, Monica! Would you stop being such a wuss?
Hi! Okay, don't be mad at me, but I couldn't resist.
Yeah that's right you weren't thinking! Y'know what? Let me give you something to think about!
I can't believe it! He still hasn't called.
See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened? He got phased out!
Well, it doesn't sound like it! I mean, it's pretty easy not to kiss someone, you just don't kiss them! See look at us, right now, not kissing!
But I thought that ring stood for Caprice's undying love for her brother.
All right, okay, Laurie proposes to Jo, and she says no, even though she's still in love with him, and then he ends up marring Amy.
You're welcome.
Hi honey!
Well I...
Well uh, his answering machine was very understanding. Ugh. I feel blue.
Joey?
You and Ralph?
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait.
Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute honest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'.
"Ooo," what?
Don't say anything. I don't wanna speak, I don't wanna think. I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now.
Fine.
That's right! 'Cause that would give him the control! So now he's all ooh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing y'know, trying to get me to hint around for an invitation. Blew up in his face, didn't it?
OK.
Oh?
Ohhh!
What?!!
Ahh....So...Wow...The spring line, it's really going to be great this year, huh?
Hey.
Okay.
C'mon, I'm not saying it was a bad movie, I'm just saying, you know, it was a little. . . hard to follow.
Oh!
Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?
Ohh. Oh, so you really wanted to learn. Yeah, y'know, Pheebs I just wanted to have fun. Ohh, you know who you should go with?
All right Ross!! I get it!!
He's perfect, he's never been better.
And?
Ooh, goooosh, ooh, these are cookies smashed in the sports section.
Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.
Hi!
It's not a baby! It's a cat!
OK, I'm guessing this is from...
Huh umm...
Ross! Your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago! And could you strike "Consummated like bunnies" from the record?
Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?
Yeah, he broke those too.
Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.
Well, hon-ey. I'm just trying to look nice for your big night.
Ive never done that.
No Mon that's not the point. I'm out a thousand dollars, I'm all scratched up, and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand!
All right.
Okay.
Saving, saving, saving me from the pleasant conversation with the interesting man, saving me?
God, Monica it's on the ceiling.
Oh how can you possibly know? Look at this mess, Tag! I mean, this is what I'm talking about! You have to be organized! You've got newspapers! You've got magazines! You got-Ohh! And who is this chippy? A little young for you Tag, but whatever.
Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, let's do that Sailor Joe. Quick question though, what's this called?
Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!
Where you goin'?
Good luck to ya!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just...It's just so sad!
No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to figure out what I want
Oh hi! Y'know, I just wanted to see if there were any leads on the old job front.
Oh, but he was my pig man...how did I not see this?
Oh wow. That-y'know what? That is so unfair. Y'know what? Now I want to steal your thunder! Come on Ross, let's go have sex!
Ugh, it was horrible! And-and the interview part went so well, y'know? I even made him laugh. He said something about a boat and I was like, "Well, yeah! If you've got enough life jackets!" Trust me, it was actually, it was very funny. Anyway, so we were saying good-bye and ugh!
Yeah, sure. Umm, they didn't have poppy seed bagels, so I... Oh my word!
I am so gonna miss watching you freak people out like that!
Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.
All right. I'm a total pro!
No-no, it's really not huge.
December 26th, huh maybe she's Santa Clause.
What?!
Ohh, okay, how about five. Ohh, thank you.
Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't know what that's for.
Oh my God! Are you serious?!
Well what happened at dinner?
Joey!
No. Oh, oh, I guess it would be different if I were- with somebody.
Well what is it? Let me see.
Because she hates Pottery Barn.
Well, maybe-maybe I could be your roommate Pheebs.
Yeah?
Right!
Ross? Look, whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants, just give it to her. Come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. So just fix whatever she wants fixed. Just do it. I mean, you're gonna have to try. You'll just gonna hate yourself if you don't. Oh come on answer it! It's driving me crazy!
Oh-okay, but Pheebs?
I won't speed.
Great! Monica's moving!
Ugh, you will not believe what that sleaze-ball from Ralph Lauren did too me!
I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.
Awful, absolutely awful.
Uhh, I mean this is like reading about my own life. I mean this book could have been called 'Be Your Own Windkeeper Rachel'.
Hey!
But....
Okay.
Okay, you guys, just relax. I doooo.
Really Joey?
I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against that thing!
Really?
Yeah okay, you laugh now, but she's gonna be yours.
This time it's not so funny.
Hey!
So uh, so did anything happen? Because rumor has it you guys shut the drapes!
Okay. Oh wait, wait-wait, you're not gonna come with me?
What's that? What? I saw my name. What is it?
Yeah!
That had to hurt!
Yeah that works.
Yeah, it'll be fun. We'll run in the park. It'll be like our first y'know roommate bonding thing.
Ohhhhh, don't be mad...
You what?
Hi!
But! Don't you have to give him his money back?
You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.
I'm not mad.
So that there will be a decent place for me to sit.
Yes, I know that. I know that. And I know that hiring him was probably not the smartest thing that I've ever done. But I'm telling you, from this moment on I swear this is strictly professional. Yes?
I wanna say a disease.
Come on, they were not that huge.
Ross.
I know.
Oh yeah, go ahead.
Whoops. Oh, hey, do you need help with that?
What are you? Monica!! Stop it!! Oh my God! Stop it!
There was a woman at the... The stripper?!
Ross, you don't know that.
Cecilia Monroe man, what a great actress.
Yeah.
Aww, look at the little thing.
That's all right. I mean hard is it to get a couple drinks right, huh?
Ohh, yes.
Definitely! Phoebe, you will not find a single game show host, who's ass I cannot kick.
Well y'know, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh, we'd jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so they'd put salt on their cereal.
yeah-yeah-yeah!!
Yeah! Y'know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, I have wondered whether I made the right choice. And now I know.
I knew it! I knew it, ahh....
Okay. All right, I see what he's doing! He's not asking me out, because he wants me to ask him out.
Joey no, this is wrong! You have to take it back, okay? You don't want to win an award this way. You're very talented. And someday you're gonna win one of these for real and that one is gonna mean something.
Yeah, she's gay.
Why? Just because you're not mature enough to understand something like that?!
I found him! Very funny, come here! That is exactly why I've come here to talk to you okay?
To be nice.
Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let's talk about it!! How was she?
Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back, y'know? Good luck, Rach.
Yes.
Hey! What happened to you? Why didn't you come up?
No, y'know what? It's gonna be okay. I mean you don't have to have this rustic Italian feast. Y'know? And-and you don't need, you don't need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack.
I'd love to!
What are you talking about? I love them! Yeah, I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it. And then, then my cat died. But Joey, isn't this cool?
What?! No! I'm not gonna move out!
So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
Yeah, but Mon that's totally different. He was you're health teacher.
Oh, I forgot this was in here. Umm, this was the uh garter that I was saving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monica's something borrowed and it's blue. Yeah...
Yeah!
Hi, this is my friend Rachel.
Wow! This place is fabulous!
Sure, is she married?
Okay, but Ross, eventually you and I are gonna be dating.
Okay. Wait! Wait!
Yeah, 'cause that's why you won't get Isabella Rosselini, geography.
I can not believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people looking like something you drink when your nauseous.
Oh my god.
Oh wow, uh okay, uh maybe. Umm, yes, I can do that!
Ben, its Rachel! But whatever.
Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?
Okay.
Oh tomorrow, oh I don't know. Um...
Hey!
Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...
Okay, so let's play for some pepper! Stop spending my money!
All right!
Well no.
Thank you.
I'm fourth! Look at you with your little maple syrup award!
I-Ohh!
Okay, maybe they are not funny to you...
Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some Jell-O with them.
No, no, no, no I don't think it's weird, I think, I think umm, in fact, in fact you know what I think?
Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.
I don't care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!
Oh, come on squeeze it.
All right look lady here is the deal, I came here for an annulment and I am not leaving here until I get one!
Whoa! I can't believe you did that. That was really sweet.
Yeah, oh my God, tomorrow! That, no, it's perfect. Oh God, thank you soo much. Great! Bye! I got the interview!
Uh-huh.
Okay, listen, I'm thinking, why don't we just tell them who we really are? I mean, it'll be fine, I really think it'll be fine.
Thank you. Now are you sure? Because once I make a copy, there's no turning back.
God. You seem really, really nice.
So umm, what's this book about?
Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!
Ohhh, OK.
Ohhhhhhhh God.
Okay, he's a, he's a black capuchian monkey with a white face... ...with, with Russian dressing and, and pickles on the side. Okay. Thanks.
Pheebs, I have to ask you...
Yeah, I do. I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear your head, I think it'd be really good.
Pheebs, I don't know what to say. I guess the flea market was just better last time.
Yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree like that.
I ah... Oh! I'll squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning!
Ross, my father doesn't hate you.
Oh, honey! Don't get up! What do you need?
No we weren't! It was nothing! It was one night, senior year we went to a party, had a lot of sangria and y'know, ended up...kissing for a bit.
Hi.
Yeah!
Because I promised Mindy I would.
I need to talk to you!
We're sorry.
Okay, uh...
A scooter!
No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-I-would you-actually, would you go check on that?
Yeah, but how much can you tell from a look?
That's-that's great! See? I already feel like I know you a little better! Thank you. Okay, come on. Now we can go eat. Let's go.
That's nice.
Oh please. That Paolo thing was barely a relationship. All it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal sex. Ok, ya know, that sounded soooo much better in my head.
Oh! That's fine.
Well?
Umm, honey, look he just came over to....
Ohh! Really?!
What?
Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that it was a club they went to. Oh God, I'm, I'm sorry.
Well, I used to date him, but you're still going out with her!
I don't know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it'll die.
Be-because I didn't want him to think I was stupid! I mean, that was really embarrassing what happened to you!
I'm Rachel Green.
Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you're sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
It's All Relative!!
All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.
Taurus?
That is not true. She did! She forced me!
Ok, here, I know what we can do.
You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. I mean, it's not sweet, it's not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear, I know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying, "Rachel!"
Ross you're not listening to me, I don't have time to stop.
What-what are-what are these?
Yeah, you should, really.
It's OK, it's fine.
Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him!
And with Chandler in the next room. What are you, what are you sick?
How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag? I'll pay.
From now?
Okay. Okay. I think we can do this if we just get organized. All right? We have two days to plan this party. We just need to make fast decisions! Okay? All right, where are we gonna have it?
Noo! Oh God we did-we didn't, we didn't uhh...
Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend.
Oh.
Okay? Whoa, wait!
I did, Monica was so sweet she left a little mint on my pillow.
No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did not see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson! I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which obviously is an impossible thing to do!
All right I know, I know how it looks Pheebs, but I'm telling you...
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry, it's just that when you moved your hands down to my butt, it was like woah, Ross's hands are on my butt. Sorry.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Bye.
Hi-e!!
Oh yeah! I know.
Mr. Treeger.
Oh, okay, well, I think we should let Phoebe decide, because she's the only who's impartial, and she's so pretty.
They're male nurses.
Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants?
Hi.
Oh, okay. Will you take my place?
Oh, I beg to differ. The Pictionary incident?
Well, well, well, hop back in bucko, cause I got four sixes! I won! I actually won! Oh my God! Y'know what? I think I'm gonna make a little Ross pile. I think that one was Ross's, and I thinkohthat one was Ross's. Yes! : Well, I have got your money, and you'll never see it...
Oh! You are?
OK, that's dead right?
Oh my God!
What? What is so strange about me having a date?
I just- I don't think us getting back together is a good idea.
Ross, please, I found the magazines!
Oh, yeah! Yeah!
Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!
Oh, god.
All right, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't tell you but you were so mad already!
Oh, that's sweet.
I really think you need to go now.
He's got this thing. And I keep telling him to go to my chiropractor...
Okay, I'm not just waitressing. I'm.. I, um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies.
You give me back my Walkman!
You want me to talk you out of it?
Oh! I used to do that too!
Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.
Oh y'know what, we don't have to talk about work. We can talk about anything!
What?
No honey, it's okay! Listen, I'll got to Ross's and get the blender, you get all the margarita stuff ready.
Where the hell've you been?
All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?!
That is the sweetest thing, I just....
Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming. He's coming. Hey, what's up?
High-five, the babies are coming!
Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.
That's right!
Ooh, ooh, ooh,ooh,ooh. Hi.
Oh, yeah, right.
Monica, I'm your best friend.
"Baddest man in the whole damn town."
Oh, yeah, sure, it's umm...
Hey!
Gimme an 'L!'
Oh, slides. So really nothing happened.
God, oh God Monica, I forgot. This is our first date.
Ok, Well, what about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?
Phoebe!
I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with it. I gotta get out of here.
I'm Monica's maid of honor. Okay? Don't try to blue pin me!
Oh.
Hey! So, did you quit?
Yeah.
Okay, Ross, I'm really trying to tell you something here.
Foot rubs for a month!
Okay.
Oh.
That's fine. So Monica, you are now in control of my love life.
Right.
I know.
I don't know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and y'know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.
Hey.
Is-is he coming?
You stole them from me!!
Oh my ... you think I'm a pushover. Well wait, watch this, you know what? You're not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I think that's pretty strong, that's what I think. Come on, Monica, let's go to lunch.
Well, y'know, possibly. You didn't tell him that, though? Right?
It's okay! It's okay! It kicked once, it'll kick again!
Well, we were going to do that after-I mean umm, next.
That's right, he can have his job back. I'm glad we got that all straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back.
What?
Hey-hey! Oh, look at you, all sexy.
I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.
Joey?!
Well, I'm sorry I'm not going to an eye doctor!
OK... ah, it's light... ...it rattles... it's... Travel Scrabble! Oooohhh, thank you!
Ahh, yes, I will have a glass of the Merlot
No, there's a party. There's a party. But the power, that is still up for grabs. You follow me?
Uh-huh.
How many guesses do you get?
Oh, hi! How are you doing?
Oh, yeah! Real fun. Y'know, this bra... Really, bothers me. Y'know, this used to be my bedroom. Yeah. A lot of memories in here, a lot of memories. If these walls could talk, y'know what they'd say? Wanna hear some memories?
Okay.
Ewww, ewww, ewww, ewww!
It's a, it's a cat!
Okay!
Y'know what, I-I have to go talk to her, would you let me just get changed?
Do you have any ice?
Well, then talk!
Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! I cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!
Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?
When I was um, 7, I crashed my bike right out in front of his house and to stop me from crying he kissed me right here.
Yes!
People are trying to sleep in here!
No, I know! I get it! It's funny!
Okay.
What? This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is not-that's-that's not what it is. See, see, okay, I work in fashion, see and-and, this is a real dress actually. It's-it's, they're-they're wearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how people respond, and then I report back to my superiors at Bloomingdale's, so... And obviously in uh, in-in this case, I am going to report back, "USA not ready."
Oooh.
Okay, well can't you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?
What? Oh, I'm sorry, I can't, I'm busy.
All right, fine.
Oh, my, God, c'mon, you guys! He's gonna be home any minute! He's gonna kill me!
Wait! Okay!
Because you do.
Oh!
You know what?
Hi you guys!
I'll do it.
You guys! You guys!
Sure! Why?
Yeah, we're, we're actually just gonna walk 'cause it's right up there at the Angelica.
Thanks.
I don't know, I'm sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here.
Really?! Okay well then, all right, well just have a seat there. Umm, so what's-what is-what's your name?
Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I'm doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I'm doing something that I'm actually good at. I mean. if you don't get that...
Monica, you broke up with him for a reason.
Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Honey, listen, y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful.
She'll be out in a second. So, Chip, how's umm, Amy Welch?
What? Wait, what?
And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!
NO but Ross. We are never gonna happen, OK. Accept that.
No! There's no orange juice in there! We win!!
Merrill Lynch?
Hi! All right, let's go shoppin'!!
Noo, that's our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor.
No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.
Oh... Italy, I think.
Y'know what, just give me a second and I'll be out of your hair. I'm just gonna grab a jacket. When I get back, I want every little detail. Maybe that's him.
There's more alcohol, right?
Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun.
Oh I know, my God, this is so-this rice is so-I am so good.
But y'know umm, Rachel doesn't rhyme with draddle.
Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.
Your sunglasses?!
What?
I think so.
I got it!
I'm so sorry.
No. Joey, she knows! We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment and we saw them doing it through the window. Actually, we saw them doing it up against the window.
Oh, this is just terrible.
Anybody wanna trade? Oh...
What?
How-how did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?!
Oh, did you beat him at a board game? He turns into such a baby when he starts to lose.
All right, you know what, that's fine. If you guys want to be children about this, that's fine. I do not need to see it.
Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you don't have either.
Does anybody want anything else?
Oh, hi.
Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover.
We're not gonna do this, all right? She's just gonna think that we're doin' it.
Yeah but-but-but you liked me! Oh my God, I can't believe this, all this time, I liked you and you liked me!
Oh, not much. I-I got a job.
So uh, heard you had some fun with Tag last night.
Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!
Because I lose her stuff!
Okay, that doesn't help me, because we went to the same high school.
No, it's not gonna be okay Ross, tomorrow is my last day, and I don't have a lead. Okay, y'know what, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna call Gunther and I'm gonna tell him, I'm not quitting.
Uh, no. Wait, you know what, this is the outfit that makes my calves look fat. Nevermind.
Oh, now see that's a fancy but.
Hello! Ohh, kids love me.
Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?
Fine!
Oh. Oh my God.
So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out.
Hey, guys, what's up.
You can't, because of the new skylight!
Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan.
So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?
Oh my God! What does that thing do?
This is totally your fault!
Okay, bye-bye!
I'll tell ya who should be embarrassed! It's you guys! Come on! This is ridiculous! Thank you very much, but I do not need you to get me a date!
I know, I remember that!
Bye. What a manipulative bitch.
No, God! Please, let me!
I got-I get a big pay raise!
Something to do with numbers?
Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!
Remember when we were in high school together?
Because it's Richard's son! It's like inviting Greek tragedy over for dinner!
Yeah, they were very y'know...wrestley. But, I guess that's normal?
Hi, I'm sorry I'm late but I am ready, ready to talk you up! When does Liz's father get here?
Hi!
No Paul, I don't know anything about you! Y'know, like-like your childhood! Tell me about your childhood!
Excuse me?
Well, I just called Joshua...
I am still talking!! And then you chase away the one guy that I actually liked! I mean, no offense to you guys. Really! I mean congratulations on all the cash, and-and y'know--Wow! You do have very soft hair! But I would much rather go to the ball all by myself than go through anymore of this! Good-bye! Now do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair?!
Ross, I...
Yeah.
Hey!
They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!
You are so beautiful.
Yeah, you do.
Whoa-whoa, there's two living rooms? God, growing up here, this place must've been a real babe magnet.
Yeah.
Well, you know, no suds, no save.
Well of course we will help you decide! We will do anything we can to help you! Now, I would like to make a toast, to the future Mrs. Chandler Bing , my best friend, and truly one of the nicest people that...
But he has to know how I feel!
Ross, honey, is there anything we can do?
Who is it?
You do know that I will be here when he comes over.
Well. Woah, look at that! I gotta go, I gotta date. With a man. Um, OK, you guys have a really, uh, have a really good night and you two have a, uh, have a, uh, really good cat. OK, we're not supposed to take these when we leave.
Really?! You think so? Y'know, I had just rolled out of bed.
No...oh, I feel so stupid! Oh, I think about the other day with you guys and I was all "Oh, Paolo, he's so great, he makes me feel so..." Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed!
Oh yeah. Right. So now, are-do you, do you still do music?
Oh my God! I can't believe you guys are actually think you're moving in here!
Maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there.
Good. Although y'know, he-he's a private guy. Y'know, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.
Hey, c'mon, cut it out.
Wait, we still have time to talk and they're-they're not even in the car yet! Oh look, there they go, okay.
Yes, Ross.
Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you.
Smell familiar?
Well it stupid, unfair question!
Got a job on a river boat?
Jill! Did you shop?!
That was amazing. I can't even send back soup.
Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer?
'Kay.
Okay, I'm just gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready?
Oh!!
Ball? There is no ball.
Oh gosh, it has something to do with numbers.
Chandler gets it! It's Chandler Bing!
Thank you! Break!
What-what-what are you gonna do?
Wow! I can't believe you lied to me.
Oh my God!
You know.
Okay.
Do you even know who Kip is?
I mean he just started going out with her.
Why, when did you get out of the game?
Umm... I'm never gonna getting married!
But, what you and I have is so much better. Ok, we have tenderness, we have intimacy, we connect. Ya know, I swear, this is the best I have ever had.
Then what? What do you want?
So umm, what time are you supposed to leave?
Yeah well, Ross just made plans for the whole century.
You did!
You seem to really like her.
And that was so sweet of you to ask! Oh my God, the three of us are gonna have such a good time living together!
Hi!
I'm fine! I'm fine! I'm just losing a tooth, it's no big deal. I have a dentist! Y'know. I'm gonna go put some ice on it. Excuse me. What do I do now? What do I do now?
Hello!
Well then you're going to have to take her out again.
Phoebe, I already, I already did.
Come on!
Okay.
Okay, uh-uh imagine this, "The Mr. Bowmont."
Yeah! Oh by the way, thank you for loaning us Pamela and Yasmine.
Gimme an 'M!'
Hey, how are those tapes working out for ya?
What line?
And a crappy New Year.
Oh really?!
Ohh, thank you for the wonderful dinner.
All right, we were shaking hands and he kinda leaned toward me... Y'know maybe he was going to open the door, but I totally miss read him and I uhhh...
Alright, Monica, I want you to have the first taste.
And?
What?
Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.
I don't care! The wires have come loose in your head!
Oh b-b-but it is!
Hey.
Hey. Oh, poor Pheebs.
Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?
You don't even know!
Bye.
Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.
Okay!
Wow.
I don't know. I don't know... I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross. Y'know what I mean? I mean, it's Ross.
Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.
Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?
Well, I was actually-I-I came over here to-to borrow this lamp. To umm, look at my books, y'know, see them a little better.
So from that you think you've got me all figured out? Well, you don't! Y'know I-I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here!
And I'm in it? Then let me read it.
A lover?
Oh please, theyve been going out a week. They havent even slept together yet, I mean, thats not serious.
Well that was umm...Okay.
All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!
Okay Joey, we're luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham?
Umm, I think there was a restaurant... I know there was wine. . .
Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.
Well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans?
Really?!
Ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married.
You and your stupid fear. I hate your fear. I would like to take you and your fear....
Joey, it's just a chair! What's the big deal?
Hi.
Hello, Mark? Hi, it's Rachel Green. Oh no, don't you apologize. Yeah, I'll hold. He left my number at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers.
That really is something; that's really cool.
Well, it's about time.
Monica what?
Hey, Mon, you want some help?
What does she mean?
Marcel?
Oh.
You're out of Diet Coke.
Uhh, because I'm trying to play hard to get. Oh, quick he's looking over here, say something funny.
Well, you're lucky you never met that bitch Sharon Majesky. Anyway, umm... The rest of you life, y'know? Any regrets?
Okay. But wait!
Oh, hi!
Oh my God! I bet that's him. My digital fairy tale is about to begin. I wonder how I should be? Should I be uh Hello? Or should I be Hi! It's Rach... Would you stop doing that?!
That's not the end.
I can make you a legend. I can make you this generation's Milton Berle.
Great set tonight Phoebs.
I know. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. All right, this is what we're gonna do, we are gonna go to the next highest bidder, and we are just gonna let them buy it, and then you're just gonna pay the difference.
Whoa! Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are the one who is too much.
I've got some bad news.
Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye.
And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?
Did you just break the radiator?
And-Joey!
Okay. I'll miss you.
Yeah, well, y'know umm... No honey, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. Don't hit on your existing friends!
Y'know what? That's a lot to remember, can't I just tell her you're a pig?
Ummm. Oh! I'm sorry. It's a little old but...
You are so just doing this out of spite.
Yes, yes, Bombay is bery, bery nice time of year.
Yes, my wind. How do you expect me to grow if you won't let me blow?
No.
Ohh, gosh. You guys, come on, this is-I have to meet Joshua! This is my one chance for him to see the fun Rachel. Y'know the "Wouldn't it be great if she was my wife" Rachel. Ohh, all right! Are Joey and Chandler back?
A couple of bucks.
Yeah, I'm with Mon.
What is she doing here?
So uh, Ryan, were you shipping off to?
Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?
Well I just came... I just needed to tell you... Congratulations.
Her dancer friends?
Yes! Yes! Yes, I do! I do know! Frank and Alice are gonna want to keep all of their children!
No luck huh?
Yeah.
No, I was ten. I just developed early.
Yes.
You do? Why?
Does it still hurt?
Well, we were just talkin' about you guys gettin' married and how great it is.
Yeah, I guess Gunther is kinda...
Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!
Uh-huh.
Thank you. So are we good?
I hope it's okay.
Well! Good night. I'm going upstairs.
Yeah, so let's get started on the wedding plans!
Oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat!
What do you get? Emily!! Emil-Whoa!! Okay! So that's me as a cheerleader! Ta-dum!
Yeah, maybe...
Wait, I'm not just gonna drink somebody's old coffee.
I am not horsing around okay? I am Porsching around.
I do.
Yeah. Sure.
Um... unless, unless I use yours.
Ohh...
Oh my God! What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl that-that would just sleep with him?
Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.
Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was in love with you!
Why hasn't he called Rachel? Why? Why? I don't understand. Why? He said he'll call. Why? Why? Chandler I'm telling you she has flipped out, she's gone crazy!
Look at you, you are so big I can't believe it!
Yeah!
Remind me to introduce you to someone!
Really?
Luisa? Oh my God! Monica! It's Luisa!
Gay? Yeah.
Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?
I'd wait.
Hi!
Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.
I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before.
Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck here with you guys.
Ohhh!!
I'm in.
Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?
Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming!!
Y'know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!
What's the matter with you?
Oh, ah with who?
Let's do it! Ross?
Oh no-no-no...
Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus?
Ohh, okay, I'm sorry. You're right. Y'know what? We absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other. All right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what you're asking of me.
Just one drink?!
Oh no-no, no-no, they don't want you to put your hands in the pockets until you are out of the store.
Because I knew you were lying!
Wh--Why don't I tell you over here?
All right, wherever you wanna go is cool.
Okay. Yeah, that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself for a night.
Honey, come on! You live far away! You're not related. You lift right out.
Wha...
Okay.
Look, this is not that big of a deal! You just don't date Ross! There's a million other guys out there, you just...
Joey, did you my face cream?
Oh.
Well, I-I know you can do that too. I'm just, I'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to... Hi!
Surprise...
Oh, do I?
So, which of this kitchen stuff is mine?
No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... : W-well, what else did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?
Would you stop?! What is the matter with you?!
Yeah, Joey honey, I don't know if this'll mean anything to you but you'll always be pre-approved with us.
Yeah, he dumped me. He said, "Rachel, I can't do this. Even though you are a very, very, very beautiful woman. I can't do this. I'm married and I'm sorry." And then I don't know why but he said, "and you will never get promoted. Especially not above Kim, who is an integral cog in the Ralph Lauren machine."
Okay.
Ugh!
Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!
Yeah! I'm gonna have a boyfriend, you're gonna have a girlfriend...
My God! What happened to you?
Oh my God Phoebe! I mean I'm just-Wait a minute. If I'm your maid of honor that means you are Monica's.
Yeah! Ohh, I've been waitin' so long to get on that body!
OK Julie, so now let's start with your childhood, what was that like?
Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?

Right.
All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler.
Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I was going to keep the uh, the cute guy's cell phone?
Chandler! Is he?
Okay.
There you go!
Four.
This one's from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it's a book... feels like a book. And... ...it's a book!
Ohh, that is soo sad.
No. Ross, it, it just seems that y'know it's time we-we y'know, move on. I mean, I mean don't' you think?
Good! I'm glad it's not a problem.
Yeah!
Oh, come on! This is crazy! Can't we just flip a coin?!
No....
Oh my God, Jill!
Yeah. Thought I'd give it a shot. I'm still on the first chapter. Now, do you think his 'love stick can be liberated from its denim prison'?
And that's Phoebe , and that's Joey.
No honey, okay, okay, you wanna know why Ross canceled the date? Because I asked him to.
Oh yeah!
Yeah, my mom got my dad's season tickets in the divorce, so she just gave them to me.
Um, excuse me, everyone. Ah, this is my last night working here, and I ah, just wanted say that I made some really good friends working here, and ah, it's just time to move on. Ah, and no offence to everybody who ah, still works here, you have no idea how good it feels to say that as of this moment I will never have to make coffee again.
Look, I am so...so happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that I'm not. I'm not even close. And I don't know, maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that that's dumb, but oh my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!
Uh no, he's not. Can I take a message?
OK, I'm doin' it for ya.
Get down?
Ross, I really don't think...
All right.
He is, isn't he? I don't know, I don't know, I mean maybe it's just being here at the beach together or, I don't know. But it's like something...
No, it's all right. I got nice boobs.
I am so sick of guys. I don't want to look at another guy, I don't want to think about another guy, I don't even want to be near another guy.
Yay! Emily!
Yeah, and also we need more umm, drinks. Hold on a second. Whup, okay. Hello! Vegas? Yeah, we would like some more alcohol, and y'know what else? We would like some more beers. Hello? Ohh, I forgot to dial!
Get out, get out of my apartment.
Oh, that's funny!
It's the woman from the hospital admissions office. She says there's a problem with the form. Oh, god, oh god...
No, no, no, I'm looking at a purchase order right here and it clearly states that we ordered the Rivera bikini in a variety of sizes and colours. And.... What does it matter, what I'm wearing?! Can I please speak to your supervisor? Thank you. We're holding.
Maybe you should put it off.
Thank you! Hey, how'd the catering go?
Barbara! Hi, how are you? Uh-huh. No, I understand. Yeah. Oh, oh, come on, no, I'm fine. Don't be silly. Yeah... oh, but you know, if-if anything else opens up, pleaHello? Hello?
Oh my God! It's Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!!!!!!
Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.
Monica, you should totally put your name down on the list
Did I miss it? Did I miss it?
Huh-huh, no act--no, uhh, that, that is basil.
Good.
So what happens next?
Okay, I'll see you back at home, if I ever get a flight out of here.
Thank you.
I'm not moving! Is that picture straight?
And Mrs.?!
And y'know what else, oh my God, are they gonna love you.
Oh, wow thanks! Oh you're in real estate!
Phoebe, come on that's silly.
Are you kidding?!
Oh, I know. Hey, y'know what we never did? Oh no, not that. We uh, we never had bonus night!
What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?
Uff.
Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates?
Well it's not, honey I'm sorry, I guess I'm just nervous. I mean, it's you, ya know, it's us. I mean, we're crossing that line, sort of a big thing.
Honey, this really is an incredible thing to do for them, but there are things to think about.
You're lookin' at it upside down-y'know what? It doesn't matter.
I hate when Ross is right!
Look at her.
I'll figure something out.
Here you go. Thank you!
Can I see you in my office for a minute?
What party?
Why? Honey, what is the big deal?
No, Phoebs. I'm dating Russ.
Oh! Tommy, this is Ross. Ross, Tommy.
No, wait Phoebe.
No Ross!! Don't! You can't just kiss me and think you're gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesn't work that way. It doesn't just make it better. Okay?
Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?
Hey.
Mm-mmm.
So what are you gonna do?
You're kidding.
Yeah!
Tag? Hi, who was that?
Ross! Phoebe's gonna be here any second, she cannot see this!
I-I-I didn't! I didn't! She thought you were cute.
Sure! God, please take those off!
Yeah!
Hey! You...can't...leave Joey! You agreed to buy that boat, all right?! That is a contract! And plus if you leave, my boss is gonna kill me!
Oh, I don't know. Well maybe it's just the idea of Barry for the rest of my life. I don't know I think I feel like I need to have one last fling, y'know, just to sorta get it out of my system.
So umm, does it?
Umm, I think he's still out. What's wrong?
Well that too. Joey?
Sure.
What?! What? What happened?!
Well, oh, Mark, I'm doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know? I'm just doing it to get back at Ross. I'm sorry, it's not very fair to you.
What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it.
Okay uh, but before you do that. I-I, I need you to talk to me.
Uh, OK, I mean uh, what, how are you gonna handle it. I mean, are, are ya gonna, are ya gonna talk about it before hand, are you just gonna pounce?
That's crazy! You can't do that! What are you going to tell her? Oh God. Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you?
Well and clearly not a minute sooner.
Ugh. Excuse me, could you give this to that guy over there? Go ahead. Thank you. Sorry. Okay, Las Vegas.
Yeah, it's in there.
Well, I like you less!
What?
Well, people missed you in there. And in fact, there was actually a request for "Smelly Cat".
Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that.
Yeah, these are pretty ch-ching.
All right.
Oh... Oh my God. He remembered.
Monica.
Phoebe are you serious?
Ooh! Y'know what? If we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour.
Hey Pheebs.
Happy New Year, Joey!
Ben just said hi.
Allll done!
Ross, you had sex with another woman!
Eh, do you believe that?
Excuse me? Can I help you with anything?
What 'cha doing Mon?
Hmm.
We can't find Chandler...-'s vest. We can't find Chandler's vest.
I'm great! I'm great. I've got a great job at Bloomingdale's, have wonderful friends, and eventhough I'm not seeing anyone right now, I've never felt better about myself.
I mean what if this keeps happening? Y'know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, y'know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she's gonna pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson?
It's not a miracle Joey! I'm sure there's some explanation.
I'm- uh- I'm okay... You look great!
I mean I'm probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I mean what's 2%? That's nothing.
Okay, who's next?!
Oh and I'll call ya too!
It's Robert Bobby.
Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do? You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right here. Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you happy now?!
What are you talking about Pheebs? I don't... Oh my God, you drew on me?!
Oh! I would love to read a poem.
Why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding?
I feel like we're the only two people in the world. Oops. Sorry.
Get your hands out of there! No!
Uh, I'm holding Ben.
Oh my God! Did you check your entire desk! Did you check all the drawers!
Oh, seriously?
Hi. Listen, I was um, thinkin' about. . .
Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's with who.
I meant, me plus one!
God, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.
Alright, I got it Ross.
Monica.
Well, of course I am! It's not gonna happen to Ross! He's your brother. He's your old college roommate. Ugh, it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go.
Well, yeah, y'know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again? I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.
Oh, c'mon, Luisa!
Yeah, I mean, you should play in public!
Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!
Well I love you too.
And you know Monica and Ross!
Okay, see? I told you!
Oh I don't-I don't know.
Bye!
Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!
What?!
Ross, you are so pathetic. Why can't your son just play with his doll?
What are you reading?
What?!
What? What!?! You kissed him?
Okay. Uh, want something-want something to drink?
Hey.
It's not! I'm defrosting a chicken. Oh, I uh sold Mrs. Whiskerson.
Oh, terrific! That'll be $2,000.
Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over.
Oh my God! Listen to you talkin' about having kids. Oh my Joey. Oh, please don't get married before I do.
Ohh!
Why, how much is this gonna cost?
No, I have to go downstairs and come back up as if I'm coming home from the regatta gala. Okay? So just go distract him. But don't be sexy.
Joey!
I thought it was Chandler!
I would love to live with you Ross; that's-that's great! Thank you!
I can't believe you don't want to know. I mean, I couldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows....
Hey, Ross!!! I told you I don't!
Phoebe?
Oh, y'know Joey, you are sick!
Surprise!!
Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!
Phoebe, what the hell are you talking about? Other than their names being similar, I'm sorry, I do not see what you're seeing.
Okay. What?! What are you doing here?!
All right. Let's say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?
Op! You're peeping!
No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don't have any of those things. That's why it's so funny.
Joey, you're such an amazing actor! How do you know where Dr. Drake Remoray leaves off and Joey Tribbiani begins?
Ok, uh, Billy Dreskin, Pete Carney, Barry, and uh, oh, Paolo.
Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, arm around her. Cramp, cramp.
Hi! Are you ready? We're gonna be late!
Oh my God! Phoebe look, it's Ross and that girl.
Oh my God!
I'm okay.
Oh, stop that, stop that right now.
Okay, whoa-whoa easy there Melissa! This ain't a locker room, okay? But, y'know I remember him saying that-that he had plans tonight.
No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!
Why? Who's not having. . . Are you and Julie not, are, are you and, are you and Julie not having sex?
Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when they're done with them they just send 'em back.
I don't know, I don't know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break.
Storming out!
I know that too.
Call her! Call her now!
You shouldn't.
Okay, all right, give me the mug! I'll keep the mug.
Well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them?
No, y'know what? Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! Or something!
Oooohh that's interesting.
Hi!
What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment?
Maybe. I-I don't know-Oh God, how could I be so stupid?!
Hi!
Wow! Monica!
Oh, it's perfect! But not for tonight.
Aw what are you?! A detective?
You know what?
Well this has story behind it! I mean they had to ship it all the way from the White Plains store.
Why?! Why not?!
You know what we should all do? Go see a musical.
Very good.
Yeah, well that's how mad I am!!
Not for me. Chip and I broke up!
And I-I am just trying to figure out why.
Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happen to me? A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine. Ross was just Ross, just this guy. Now he's Rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I can't have.
I know!
No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.
I love him. He's so pretty I wanna cry! I don't know what to do. Tell me what to do.
Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it!
Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?
Thank you.
Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me! I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless. You just saved me! You're my hero!
Oh.
Oh, Chandler!! All right, this is it! You never see Joanna again!
Why?! What is it?
Hello! Here we go!
Why, where are you going?
Oh, she does want to.
Hello, Mrs. Chatracus.
Oh my God!
For...me.
Wow! Mon, thanks! I love this plate!
No, I'm not.
Well relax, he'll be here.
Hey, nice toilet.
Do you want my pickle?
He's not 11!
Oh, I know, I'm sorry you guys. You're just gonna have to get used to the fact that I will not be dating Ross.
What?!
Okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay! I got it! I got it! I got it! I can't! I can't! I can't! I cannot go with you and my sister thing. Okay? I just can't. It's just too weird, all right? I imagine the two of you together and I freak out. It freaks me out. I can't do it! I can't do it.
How come you are?!
Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat......I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure.
Yes?
I can't believe I don't get to go to my own prom, this is so harsh.
Joey! We should just switch.
Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?
Oh my God! Oh my God! Thank you! That was the fire department, there was a fire at our place!
Nooo, he's leaving for a better job.
Okay, well this is all very impressive Hilda, um I just have one last question for you. Uh, how did I do? Was this okay?
What?
Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you're going to call her?
Okay?
I think you should drink the fat.
Whoa, look at you, you did pretty well.
To get you to make out with him!!!
What? Uhh, Phoebe, honey, honey, I know you're quirky and I get a big kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature! Not nature, fashion!
I don't want to say.
And you were at this job for four years?
Oh! See just I'm right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being alone, sucks!
You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were....
Okay.
All right, then you owe me $350.
Well, I've been up since six. Thanks to somebody's dumb-ass rooster.
Thanks!
Chandler, relax, Chandler, she'll be here.
I know!
Not right now.
You want me to see a therapist?
Pam! Oh God okay, just imagine this, "The Pam."
Everything's ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater.
Uh well, I guess I'm not gonna miss the fact that you're never allowed to move the phone pen.
Well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek.
Yeah?
I'm gonna get back to retraining.
Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!
So what are you guys going to do?
Okay. Walked right into that one didn't he?
Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!
Oh, here's that trench-coat that you wanted.
Well that's his last name.
Right.
Good.
No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times.
...medium...hmm...any cookies left?
No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop.
Monica! I couldn't find him for two hours! He was having sex with Amy Welch!
Uh-hmm.
Bye house!
I just, I feel, I-I just...
Hi! Oh you guys look so beautiful!
Okay.
Great.
I know. And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I didn't marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know?
No.
Hey!
What?
Okay look, let me paint you a little picture. All right, you are settin' sail up the Hudson! You've got the wind in your h--arms! You-you get all that peace and quiet that you've always wanted! You get back to nature! You can go fishin'! You can-ooh, you can get one of those little hats and have people call you captain, and then when you're old, Cappy.
On TV?! Yeah!
Okay, Pheebs, y'know what, let's look at this objectively all right? Ninth grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So then...
What's up?
No! They are mine!
Phoebe you can't have both of them! You have to pick one!
Oh, they're firemen guys.
Hi.
Together.
Good!
Well I-I think your wrong.
Hey!
Thanks!
Well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.
All right Paul, I'm not asking for a lot here. Okay? Just give me something. Anything!
Yeah.
Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I'm also really psyched 'cause I don't have to move in here!
Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anything-minute. Okay. Fine. Abort the plan, abort the plan.
Yeah no, I mean it was at a flea market, so it was y'know, it was like a dollar.
Oh my God!
That is not a problem.
Mon, honey, I gotta ask you something.
Well, I met Danny's sister yesterday, and uh that was actually the girl on the subway.
Well, y'know, a little of this, a little of that. Got myself a date tomorrow night.
Hey, Mon, I was just doing the dishes!
Sure, you know what? Come on, we'll just tell them that there was like a problem with like the "engine".
No, see this isn't about the movie theatre, this is about you stealing my wind.
Oh God.
Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone?
Right, and the humiliating.
So, will I like any of these guys?
And fifty. So it was like one and fifty dollars.
Really?
But honey he calls everybody by a nickname! Okay, look, I know, all right, just one dinner, please, just one night for me, please. I just want him to love you like I do. All right, well not exactly like I do, but, but, if you do come to dinner, I'll love you like I do in that black thing that you like.
Ohh, well, this is just perfect!
Umm, Joanna? I wanna talk about that interview.
Noooooooo!!
Bye.
Well you better.
Oh, honey that's awful.
Thank you Phoebe.
Tell her to wear her own earrings.
Uh-huh.
Hi!
I might know something too.
Hi, I'm Rachel.
Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'...
Oh my God! Look at this!
Pheebs, I wanna ask you something.
Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?
Y'know what? I don't, I don't think Phoebe really wants to come.
Sure.
Honey um, honey, you do realise that we don't keep the women's lingerie here in the office?
Ooh, I was soo nervous about that letter. But the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you've grown. Y'know?
Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what?
So do you uh, think we can get you one of those uh, uniform things?
No.
What? Wh-hey!
Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just loved your look when you were bald.
God! Don't-We can't let her start getting ready! This is too awful! Oh God, but wait she'll be in the gown and then he won't show up and then she's gonna have to take off the gown...
Man in the black dress... Hi! I'm Rachel! I'm a friend of Monica and Chandler's!
Hey roomie!
I don't know where the phone is.
Ohh, Phoebe, what am I going to do?
By all means.
Hello. I need to get on the 11 o'clock flight.
Wow! Look at that, Chip Matthews called. I wonder what he wants?
Well, I'm sorry I went out with him when I knew you liked him.
Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!
Oh, but y'know, no, you didn't give me your phone number.
Oh Ross, hi! Hey, how are ya? There you are!
Op, I like credit cards!
And hey! Just so you know, it's not that common! It doesn't happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!
Mon you definitely have to make it a theme wedding, and the theme could be, "Look how much money we've got!" Y'know, I mean you could put, you could put money in-in the invitations! You-you could have like little money place settings. And ah, you could start with a money salad! I mean it'll be dry, but people will like it.
Why not?
Ross! I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey made a deal!
That'd be good.
Just a job!
It happened! I am telling you it happened!
I have one.
Hey!
Noooooooo!
Hi you guys.
Little village people.
Would anybody like more coffee?
Come on!
Wow. Wow, that's great. Great. Ok, wow, you know what.
And all these people actually died?
Okay! All right! How was she?
Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why don't you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?
Sp-spoil?
How did it go with Erin?
I'd say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving.
No!
Oh! Oh, I just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you.
Don't just say yes! This isn't a game, Joey you can really get hurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!
Relaxi-Taxi!
Nice! One and a half carat easy.
Nothing. I don't want to do anything.
Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!
No! Sorry, I just thought you were somebody else. Hi!
What bank is this?
Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.
Yeah.
Y'know who I always liked? Mork.
Um-hmm.
Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter's machine!!
Oh, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home. Be home. Be home, be home, be home. Oh, you're not home.
Well, yeah, this is the deal.
Ok, so uh, who wants the last hamburger?
Well, get 'em out of here! What's wrong with you?
Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!
I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him.
Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol.
Do you want some pancakes?
Take 'em! Joey, you can touch them! They're your underwear.
What was that?
Well, isnt, isnt that gonna be weird?
Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all. I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?
"Oh, my, god."
Come on Joey!!!
Well, I guess I could take a couple days off work.
Oh no, yes I do! I do! I mean, come on go on, you were, you were saying I am happier when uh, y'know?
No?
Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.
Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone out with.
Oh.. a little..
I tried! They won't take her back.
Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!
Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back!
Ross, you're like my best friend.
I did!
Ohh, my new assistant is working out, yes.
Well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what, you're fired.
Shut up!
Oh, yeah, check it. Definitely, I want some of that.
So, how was your date?
Really?!
No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don't need that today.
Just a bug.
Hi.
I don't know, something either trees or disease-Ralph mumbles a lot.
Show cat! Quality show cat! Show cat!
Yeah.
Noooo.
Yeah.
Why? Do you have the answers written on there?
Right?
Okay, I heard that.
My God, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to do that! I wouldn't do that!
It depends on who asked.
Oh my God, honey that's great.
Really?!
What?
Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three choruses of "You'll never make it on your own".
Yeah. What kind of discount do we get?
Cats, how long do they live figuring you don't... y'know, throw 'em under a bus or something?
Well maybe he saw your hand slip briefly from the ten and two o'clock position.
OK, then get me your purse.
OK, OK. So, you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?
: Thank you. : I saw your twenty-five, and I raise you... seven.
Well that sounds kinda cool, kinda like The Hobbit.
I had a bra.
Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.
Mira, Mira, el viejo desnudo est haciendo el hula hoop!
What?
Wow! This is great! Look at all these cups! This is so weird.
Uh, I don't know. Why don't you put it right here next to my water?
Oh yes! Thank you!
Yeah. Umm, unless you wanna come inside?
I accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back y'know of course, 'cause "Let's bring the girl back who kisses everybody!"
4 o'clock. Food?
What's this? Is this Ross's wedding invitation?
Um... Done!
Okay, um, I... All right Phoebe look, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. OK? I handled the situation horribly and I should not have lied to you.
Thank you. What a bitch.
No, actually I took it off then I drew it back on.
No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.
Yeah, Joey kinda disabled it when I moved in.
Uh, I'm just, I'm just looking out your window. At-at the view. What are you guys doing?
Oh, that sounds great.
Why does it matter so much to you?!
Oh God Monica hi! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July.
Oh, you're welcome a million.
Monica, I'm quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn't even buy it! I'm telling you I'm quitting! That's it! I'm talking to my boss right now! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you get this message.
All right. Okay Chandler, enjoy your handful.
What-Pheebs?! Two dates in one day? That's so unlike you.
Uh-huh.
Oh My God, Phoebe, that's not Ralph Lauren. That's Kenny the copy guy.
EHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! My God!!!!!!!!!!! Oh my God!!!!!!!
Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?
I'm just sort of in the middle of something.
Not stupid. The very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and I said "yes."
Okay. Oh, uh, wait a minute, y'know what? I uh, I can't decide this. Umm, okay, just hold on a second.
And?
I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.
Hey! Ross, listen can you come to a charity event tonight?
Thank you, thank you, thank you, Pheebs.
Oh, nothing, he's just goofy like that, I actually, hardly notice it anymore.
Oh, I gotta get back to work.
Oh, well, are hey, are you nervous?
Wow! How are you?!
What?! What?!
Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody who's had a baby. Like your mom?
Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you.
Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere.
All right! Let's get this over with! Ugh! Ohhh! No! Look what I did! Oh, I mean, look at this mess! I mean, we're probably gonna have to clean this up! Y'know? We're gonna have to reschedule!
No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.
Are you kidding me?
And did you?!
Oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!!!
Hey Mon, let's give Pete a chance Come on, he was funny, he seems really nice, and that check thing was adorable.
Tell him.
Where ya going?
Monica! Stop it!
Fine, I will.
Okay, here we go. I'm Jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird look on your face. What? Honey, what is it? Did I get it wrong? Did I get the hair wrong? What? Did you just picture it differently? What? What?
Oh, oh, this is good, this is really good.
I'm thinking, I'm gonna order a pizza.
Uh...no. No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy.
Small...
All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!
Yeah.
Phoebe's dead.
Hi, I'm back. Listen, I need to...
Well, that's a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.
Oh my God! That is so good!
Yeah, well, it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has uh Dr. Franzblau been by?
Dad, dad. We got it!! We Got It!!!
Yes. Here you go Officer uh, Handsome.
What?
Well, okay, look. I don't know, listen, I don't know what's going on here but let's...
Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster.
Well, maybe you didn't want it to end?
What's 1922?
Does it hurt?
Yeah fun? Great! So uh, so did you guys hit it off?
What uh-oh?
Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about you...
No..!
What?
We use it!!
No, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella, so I clocked her. Ohhh! I can't believe this, all I wanted was a few hours outside of work to see Joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me.
You're so pretty.
Oh gosh, she's going to kill me.
No! Come on! Don't make me go long. Use me. They never cover me.
Okay.
No? Y'know, I can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue.
Well it's mine too! What else you got?!
Yeah.
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so bad. How did you leave it?
Well there's an idea!!
Thank you. Oh, cool! Free sample of coffee!
The most unbelievable thing happened to me today.
Oh man!
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a girl?
Yeah! Wait a minute, it's been a long time that I've been single. How come you never offered this before?
Is this a little too... Pheebs, what happened?
No.
Fine! We'll ask Phoebe.
Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before. Only $98.50 to go.
Nothing?
Okay, Pheebs, y'know what, let's look at this objectively all right? Ninth grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So then...
Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they're probably not even listening!
Whoa, wait, listen, I think I'm just gonna talk to Ross about what he think it meant.
Uhh, hang in there?
Look!
Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!
Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow.
Guess who we ran into today?!
I don't know. Whatever I was feeling, I'm... not.
All right, well the place was closed. I'll just copy it later.
OK.
Hello.
You promised you would break up with her!
I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?
Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup.
You are. Well, um... We, we, we were just... Wow!
Hey!
Okay, let me just change.
Yeah! Especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around...
Oh, honey, I don't know. I...
Yeah! That would be great!
What?!
Well, the first time didn't really count... I mean, y'know, 's'Barry.
"I'm Monica, I don't get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!"
Yes I do, it's just that Ross is. . .
Ooh, good God, they're so yummy!
What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!
Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the. . .
Sure, I'll just sit next to the trans-sexual from purchasing.
She is so cute! You could fit her right in your little pocket!
She's actually very sweet and we used to be very close.
Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!
Uh-huh.
Chandler! You're smoking? What are you doing?!
Yeah?
Monica, where did you get these?!
How are you holding up?
So it would just be, me alone?
Oh wow, uh okay, uh maybe. Umm, yes, I can do that!
He-he said Rachel, right? Do you think I should go up there?
Hi Pheebs!
Anyway sweetie, I am, I'm so sorry I ruined your night.
Umm, hi!
OK, here we go. Honey, I'm sorry, they were all out of apple pie, someone just got the last piece.
You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.
I'm sorry, I was just reading the joke below it. Man, that one is funny.
I know!
Yeah, I forget which ones.
I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I'm with him, I'm totally, totally...
Um... Ross?
Oh no, I'm sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I saw you.
Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.
Well, at least that's a great suit.
Hey, come on! I had this friend from college and I made the stupid mistake of telling Joey that one time...she and I y'know...kissed a little bit.
Oh sure it is!
I am not a pushover!
What?! What?! My birthday's not for another month!
Really?
Yeah! Sit!
Wow! I mean, I just-I can't, I can't believe this. Y'know, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe who's always been somewhat of a question mark.
Ugh!!! Well, the apartment is already subletted! I mean, this is just hopeless. I'm never gonna find anything.
Wow.
Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
Are you pregnant?!
Yeah and I'm a horrible, horrible person.
Oh, God...
I'm not in love with Ross!
Chandler!
And thank you for your time.
Rosss...
Hey, what's-what's going on?!
Okay, your band is playing at Arnold's, collect three cool points. Which means, I have five, and that means I get Joey's boxers!
Y'know, you should never be allowed to talk to people!
Oh wow.
Monica. You've, you've done it right?
Ra.... Er.. Barbra.
Y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out...
Right.
Wow! What do you do now?
Oh, y'know what you should get 'em? One of those little uh, portable CD players.
Hey Joey!
Momma's Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois.
Phoebe, you were right. I should've never gone to London, and from now on you make all of my decisions for me.
Yeah, I know. It's ridiculous! I can't see you either.
That's what I said.
What?!
And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high school, I was a cow?
Yes.
Monica, what are you doing?
Did-did you take these back?
Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?
Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks? Spoiled?
Well, yes, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names I think.
He's like a big disgusting...
Ross!
Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?
Okay, y'know, would you feel better if we went someplace else? I mean we could pack all this stuff up and y'know go to your apartment.
Ross, she's not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.
Oh well, it's kinda lonely up there, so I just thought I would come out here and get some fresh air.
Ohh, wait a minute, we haven't pre...
Oh my God! Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives, just walked in here!
HI!! Hi!
Can you not look at me when I say this? I thought that if I could get you here, I could seduce you.
Excuse us for a minute. You didn't tell her to come?!
All right, it's okay. One little setback is okay, just don't let it happen again, all right? Now since daddy paid for all this stuff, I should take it all away. But I'm just gonna take the-the pajmena. And the uh, and the uh pants. Y'know what, I'm just gonna take it all away, 'cause that way you'll just really learn the lesson. Okay? All righty, I'm gonna run a couple of errands and I will see you at dinner.
Hey, wait a minute! That is my sock!
You went out with a guy in the Navy?
How come you didn't come over earlier?
Where's Chip, why isn't he here yet?
What?! We can't do that!
Hey-hey, you guys oh hurry up, get some, there's a whole cart outside...
Hey, it's not that big a deal, I was just curious.
Yeah?
Coming.
Right.
You went shopping for fur?
Oh!
That was you?! We heard about you in Junior High! Did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout, "I will be revenged?!"
Excuse me, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to call you back, I've got a Schemp in my office. What are you doing?
Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head!
But we should move quick.
Say it!
Ross, it's okay. You can come out.
Oh! Yay! Look! There's a piece that doesn't have floor on it!
Oh my God.
I don't know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer, y'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just don't want to be 30 and still work here.
Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.
See, I don't know, for me it would have to Chantal.
Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories......about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.
Awwww.
Now that she broke up with you?
Sorry. Sorry.
No Phoebe! You cannot get the phone that way; that's not fair! Okay look, I have an idea. Why don't we, why don't we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. And then whoever does gets the phone.
Hi! I just wanna--Ahhh!!! Oh my God! Oh my God!
Ohh, he's married! Ross is married. I can't-I still can't believe it.
Well, sure! Come in! Well, what-what happened to your girlfriend?
"Pheebs, can't make it, got a date. Talk to you later. Big Daddy." Big Daddy?
What are you shushing?
Tommyyyy! Say, what's your favourite thing about summer?
Wow.
Oops! All right, so what do you want to do now?
Hey!
Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.
Yeah. I'm sorry.
What? What's what you were afraid of?
Okay.
I don't know...right, he's the pig!
Why?
Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun.
Oh it's OK. You were worth the wait, and I don't just mean tonight.
Oh. Well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that.
Huh?
Eh, I'm just so sorry I put you through it. And, I y'know, I don't want to get back together over a machine.
We went through a lot of wine tonight, you guys.
Well, let me just check that with what I got here, all right see 038 is not the number for this store, 038 is Atlanta. And I...
Well, can't you tell her that you are not in the mood?
Um, there was a Geller Cup?
No, really. Really, Pheebs, you're not gonna be the one worrying about saving for college, or yelling at them when they're bad, y'know, or deciding to put them on Ritalin when they just won't calm down. Y'know?
Oh.
Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?
I have.
I'm sorry?
Hello? Like he was really gonna send you one? She was a big girl.
It's not dumb. But, maybe it's okay that you're not a part of it. Y'know what I mean? I mean it's like, I-I-I like that you're not involved in that part of my life.
Phoebe. We would like to talk to you for a second.
Y'know I don't, I don't understand guys, I mean I-I would never congratulate Monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin' her boob.
I couldn't be inner. Monica?
Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross. I said don't go!
All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!
Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.
So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?
One hour.
Noo!!
Well I. . .
You wanna go inside and have some coffee?
The earring? No. But look, I found my sunglasses under the couch! I've been looking for these since like last summer.
We'll take Literature!!
Uhh, we still need a tip.
Okay. I'm sorry. You're right, you're right.
Well maybe, maybe she's with us right now?
Hi! Just so you know, we-we didn't mean to fog you, we thought you were like a yeti or something.
Now Joey, what did the duck do?!
And that makes you angry because...
Just get out! Now!!
Well, h-how is this like that?
Okay.
What happened?
Oh no, no-no-no, that's not, not, not, what he is doing. He's just, he's just really romantic.
Hi!
What are you doing?
'Cause I am really happy about us. I think we are, I think we are so on the right track! Y'know? I mean, I think we are working, I think we are clicking. Y'know?
Hey Phoebs, how'd it go with Scott last night?
Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding!
Yeah. Just, if it's possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?
I'm sorry, let her?
Assistant buyer. Oh! I would be shopping... for a living!
Uh, thank you Phoebe. Umm, well, what struck me most when reading Jane Eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time.
Yes!
Phoebe! You can't do th...
Hey!
You like me?
No seriously! Seriously! What has happened to the sanctity of marriage?
Yeah.
Whoa-oh, what's-what's that?
This one is uh Paul O'Neil.
You didn't get it?
Come on you guys! What are doing?! I thought we were the patch sisters!
Ok mom, you know what, fine, I'll make an appointment ok, but you know what, right now, I gotta go, I gotta go do a thing.
Did you just say Hi, Jew?
Ross said there's still no word from Chandler.
What?! I didn't have a good time in Greece! Ross abandoned me! Okay, I couldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up to me all the time going, "Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying?" I mean, it was sooo humiliating. I felt like such an idiot! I mean, it's all my fault! And you know why, because I make very bad decisions.
Hey, nice pillow. So now tell me, is this genuine Muppet skin?
I get to hire my own assistant!
I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so sorry! I'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do.... I meanI'm sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I'm sorry.
Yeah, I did. I needed my lucky dress.
Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him.
I, I don't know, um, do you think you're cute? OK, we're kinda gettin' off the track here. Um, I was supposed to come here and tell you my friend thinks you're cute. So what should I tell her?
Look at it, isn't it beautiful?
No! You gotta get me out of here Phoebe! These bargain shoppers are crazy!
Oh for God sake just pick a piece!
What? Wait a minute. What are you saying, that I'm a pushover? I'm not a pushover.
Three of your five, what?
Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad.
Hey!
That cute waiter guy from your restaurant, the one that looks like a non-threatening Ray Liotta?
Yeah-yeah, we never had that,
What is my sister doing there?! And why are the drapes shut?!
Hi!
That's it. Ow!!!
Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome. I'm talking to Rome.
Are you makin' him a sandwich?
Ooh, I have to go pack. It really does?
Ohh, well you got 'em.
Honey, you have nothing to prove. And if you really like this girl, I don't flirting is the right thing to...
No Joe, no miracle.
Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
What? What? He's interested in you. He-he likes your hair, he just wants to know how you got here.
Ross look, look this is good for you. Okay? Let's face it, so far the guy's not lovin' ya! But I can turn that around! I got the inside track! We can all go out to dinner, y'know? And I can talk you up! Ross, the guy is a very, very successful lawyer!
Hey Joey, what 'cha doing?
Let me see that. Oh, yeah.
OH MY GOD!!! Sorry, I was just imagining what it'd be like to catch the money bouquet.
Alright, c'mon! Let's play Twister!
When she sees that you're gone, she's gonna know that I let you out, and that I was in here, and I'm gonna get fired!
Okay.
Honey, honey, I'm sorry, I know it's our anniversary but I told you on the phone I don't have time to stop.
You had no right coming down to my office Ross. You do not bring a picnic basket to somebody's work! Unless maybe they were a park ranger!
Yes, you're having a boy!
Who?
What, isn't he sober?
Okay! Check it out!
Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
Yeah! I am soo gonna marry that guy. Ohhh!
That's your, that's your dad's bedroom. That's your dad's bedroom!
Just give us our apartment back!
Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.
Rachel.
Well I-I-I'm not moving.
Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?
No, no-no-no. Phoebe, this was my fault and besides y'know what? I'm fine here.
So Pheebs, what do you want for your birthday?
I don't wanna hear "Three failed marriages!"
A big idiot.
Yeah! Why?
All right listen umm, I just bought something I'm not sure she's gonna like it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that I wanted since I was a little girl.
Oh, I blew it. I wouldn't of even hired me.
As are you...
Oh.
Yeah?
Ok, ok, ok, I will, I will, I, hey, I will clean the apartment for two months.
Yeah, well Betty's kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates. Now, while I distract her, you get in the office.
Well, you should have.
Hey!
Oh, please, you wanted to get caught.
Joey...
Hey!
Hey.
Well, I have to be, I don't really have a choice, I mean, you know, I could look at the bright side, I get two birthday parties and two birthday cakes.
Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?
Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which I think is-is mirrored in the wildness of Heathcliff's character.
Jurassic Park could happen.
She'll be a much better friend when the market closes.
Oh my....
Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.
So, Spin The Bottle works like this I spin the bottle, it lands on Gunther, so I would have to kiss Gunther. (She crawls over to where Gunther is sitting and sees the look of anticipation on Gunther's face and decides not to kiss him.) All right. Who wants to go first?
Hey Phoebs, whatcha got there?
Okay, two things didn't happen. Remember I told you that someone made out with Ralph Lauren in the copy room? Well, it turns out that's not true.
It is? Really?
Bathroom's up there.
Hey Phoebs. Oh hey, how's the dog?
Alright, I feel that this is totally unjustified. She gave me the green light, I did nothing but-. Do you think I can't see you in the TV set?
Yeesss.
Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship!!
Pie in the hood, pie in the hood. Go.
Yeah but, he's not your type.
It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring another one. And now it's just...
Okay.
Oh Mom!
Ohh please don't be from a real dinosaur! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Made in Mexico! Yes!! Ugh, who would buy this?!
Hey!
Mon?
What happened to uh, MEG.?
Aww Pheebs, that sucks!
Hey. Oh, I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of the other two guys to go out with, who would you pick?
Phoebe's...
No you don't!
Oh, if I only want two kids, can I keep him for another year?
Left.
Ross! Stop that!
Any sign of your brother?
We were on a break!
Okay.
Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?
Oh my God this is sooo humiliating. I think the only thing that tops that was, was, was when I was in the eight grade and I had to sing the Copa Cabana in front of the entire school. I think I got about two lines into it before I ran and freaked out. Oh my God, my entire life is flashing before my eyes.
Well if you go to Disneyland, you don't spend the whole day on the Materhorn.
What? They were like this!
Well do you get to look through one of those like, those periscope thingys.
Oh my God! How?!
Oh my god.
Could tonight be the Night?
All gone! So, farm birds, huh?
All right!!
Oh, hi sweetie.
I love it at Joey's!
Uh-oh.
Oh my God, I gotta go to work!
All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen.
No! Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn't mean I wanna walk around naked. I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.
Yeah, we could. Oh hey look! There's some Kappa Kappa Deltas! I was a Kappa. Hey sisters! Wow, we really are bitches.
Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.
Oh, come on Ross! I think it would be really good for you!
Ok, everybody, let's give a uh nice warm Central Perk welcome to--
Is my hook unhooked? These things keep falling down, I can't. . .
Hey! Oh right, tonight was your party.
Okay, it's not Relaxi Cab. It's Relaxicab, like taxicab.
All right, well how much time do you need?
Oh my God!
Now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah, who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and I think that's a big mistake and here's why. I made a huge fool of myself and I came back, that shows courage. When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no. That shows integrity. And, I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage. Okay umm, now I know I already said courage, but y'know you gotta have courage. And umm, and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace, I said no and I was not litigious. {By the way, litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against. So she didn't want to sue him. Don't worry, I had to look it up too.} So there you go, you got, you got courage, you got integrity, you got courage again, and not litigious. Look Mr...
Hi!
No! No! No! I'm not yelling at you, I'm just yelling near you. Oh God Joey, ohh I'm my father. Oh my God, this is horrible! I've been trying so hard not to be my mother I did not see this comin'. Oh, Joey, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I just wanted you to learn.
Arghh!!
Okay, you hard worker! I'll remember to put that in your evaluation.
No.
Uh, we are here to break up with you.
Well, well I can up with it!
God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what- Chandler, look at that.
Yeah actually, I think we're gonna take off too. We rented a movie.
I'm off my break now so uh, um here you take this and um, I am gonna go pour these very nice people some coffee. Ok. Oh look at that, I don't have a pot. I don't have a pot. Well, hey, maybe I've got one at home, or in Scarsdale. Hey is that a door?
Oh, I....
Really!
Y'know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding, it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.
What? C'mon, talk to me.
Oh, yeah. And uh, the best part though, when the uh, waiter spilled water down my back, I jumped up, and my boob popped out.
Ok.
OK, Phoebs. But what about you?
Oh, I probably shouldn't-so I will! Oh! Wow! It's like it's raining!
Would you like some pancakes?
Done.
Did you talk to him?
Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here...
Vogue! Hey, so tell me about this Jane Eyre woman.
You just did a little dancy thing.
What's up Joey?
Ugh, the worse day! Y'know, you think you're making progress at work and then your boss calls you Raquel.
Hello!
We're gonna find love!
Hey!
No.
Whoa! Hey-hey, you planning on inviting us?
All right, y'know what? If you don't want to believe me about this, why don't you just come with me to dinner tonight and she will tell you.
Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody. Woo!
Ross! Janice?!
Give me that!
Bye, Pheebs.
Oh.... my God.
Thank you. Oww!!!! God!
Arghh!!
Okay? Wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please? I mean tell me that you like him.
Ok.
How do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale's?
Now, now the one in the feather boa, that's Dr. Francis. Now, she used to be a man. Okay, now look, see, there's Raven. We hate her. We're glad she's dying. Okay- Wh- wh- Marcel, are you playing with Monica's shoes? You know you're not supposed to pl- whoah. Marcel, did you poo in the shoe? Marcel, bad monkey! Oh! Oh! Sorry, Barry. Little engagement gift. I'm sure you didn't register for that. Who died? Who died? Roll him over! Oh, c'mon, roll him over! Oh...! Well, we know it wasn't Dexter, right Marcel? Because- Marcel? Marc-
Oh my God. Can you imagine if there was?! I mean, what would happen exactly.
Who is it?
Well, hello, Mr. Rachel!
What?
Hey!
All right, it won't come off!
You are ready to make a commitment!
Well Phoebe, we gotta do something! Well, y'know. I mean there's no way Joey's gonna make it in time. So I'm gonna through the hotel and see if there's any other weddings going on.
Uh-huh, yeah I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with you.
No-no they do but, you just have to wait.
Please. I haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me? I mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! We went to camp together... she taught me how to kiss..
Come on see, she doesn't look that bad.
All right, how about I go over there and I will walk into Chandler's bedroom and I will see that thing that I think that I know is actually the thing that I think that I know!
Yeah.
Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!
Ohh! That's so great!
Huh, Bob Saget?
How did it go?
Anastassakis/Papasifakis wedding, excellent! {It's a good thing Jennifer Aniston is Greek, because she had to pronounce those names. Luckily for me, they were written on a sign.} Congratulations. Mazel Tov! Hi! Oh, great hat. Listen umm, I need you to perform another wedding. Can you do that?
Ok, we can do this now, can't we Ben? Yes we can, yes we can. There. I did it. I did it. Look at that, oh, stays on and everything. Hi.
Some of them.
Are you sure?
Ohh, thank you for my beautiul earrings, they're perfect. I love you.
Hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?
What's up Joe?
Yeah, I'm doing okay. I'm um...let's talk.
Why didn't you get it?
No no no no no. You wanted me to take them down, so... ..Im takin em down. Okay? Whoa!
Ok, ok, ok, moving on, moving on, next question. Ok number 29, have you ever betrayed another goddess for a lightning bearer? Ok, number 30.
Oh!
Amazingly, that makes sense.
Maybe it's not as bad as I think. Y'know, maybe they didn't take it the way I meant it.
All right, bye-bye.
Okay. Okay. All right, you take care of that. And meanwhile, the party is tomorrow and we still don't have a guest list.
Well, so, are-are you sure that there are three?!
Ohh, it's me and La Poo! Wow! I miss that dog.
You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15!! It doesn't even fit you anymore!
Do you guys ever get the feeling that um, Chandler and those guys just don't get that we don't make as much money as they do?
Yeah but Phoebe...
Oh God. Ross, OK, if you care about me at all, you will get the pie out of the man's hood.
Well, well, you said it was practice!
Okay. Okay.
Say more things like that.
Sorry.
Terrible? Hell, I was in Greece! That was a nice hotel! Nice beach, met the nice people. Not to shabby for Rachel.
No.
Oh hi!
Hey! Hey-hey-hey!!
I'll go with you.
You know what, I'm gonna do that, I'm gonna call him up, and I'm gonna ask him out. I can do that. Ask him out. How you doin'? Hi! Joshua? It's Rachel Green from Bloomingdale's. Yeah, umm, I was wondering if you umm, if you umm, left your wallet at the store today? Well, we found a wallet, and we- the license? Well, that is a good idea! Uh, well, let's see here this says this license belongs to a uh, uh, belongs to a mister uh, Pheebs, and umm, yeah, so sorry to bother you at home. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. You've done that a thousand times?
No. Yeah, and I know that. All right, well thank you so much for coming in it was nice to meet you.
Not uh, not to my recollection.
Well that-y'know it's just uh, I've never done that before. Me and him alone.
Stevie the TV?
What? What?!
Well said. And a uh good example of the fun I was referring to uhh, but I just think I'm past the point where I think I can y'know, just have fun.
Noo! Maybe! I, I don't know. Ross, I still can't forgive you for what you did, I can't, I just, but sometimes when I'm with you I just, I feel so...
A-ha!
So does it really hurt as bad as they say?
Okay.
But, Pheebs, you can still use the copy machine where I actually work. But, just come by at lunch so my boss doesn't see you. Cause Kim will just freak out and she already doesn't like me very much.
I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job-
Or?
Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.
I'm an assistant buyer!!
She's steaming her dress, why? What's up?
Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....
No?
Hey, umm, can I ask you guys something?
Okay. What the hell was that? You know what? Don't answer me. I have a date with Danny.
Oh my God.
Oh Phoebe!
Yes! Thank you.
Good, good, good, good, good.
Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing.
Oh! My hero! What happened?
How often do you read it?
They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?
Look, I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross but y'know, I've been obsessing about it all day and I'd just love not to talk about it. All right?
No, it was a stupid bet! We were just playing a game!
Really!?
What?
Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha.
Yeah! It's an apothecary table. Does anyone even know what an apothecary is?
What about you honey, who would be on your list?
Do you really not know where I'm going with this? It left! It's one huge room!
: Loser?
No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know. Uh, I just liked it better before it was better...
Remember that big thing I was gonna tell you about?
Yeah, I know, go long. Y'know, it's like all I'm doing is running back and forth from the huddle.
Okay!
Joanna, this is my friend Chandler Bing Joanna.
Oh!
Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it.
Look Benny, spoon. Spoon. Come on! All right, y'know what I think he's bored.
Oh, okay, we're going. Yeah.
What? Why?!
Hey!
Well...
I can't believe they've been together for three years.
Yep!
Oh, I think I saw some in here.
Monica, what are you talking about?
But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was clear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like...
Water it is.
Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!
Who?
Steve... sleeve!
Oh, oh, oh, I'll get 'Rainy Day Bear'!!
Chandler! Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back the way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, she's very private about her office. Now I know why.
Hey!
: So basically, you get your ya-yas by taking money from all of your friends.
Oh, I mean she's gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and people will be whispering, "Oh that poor girl." Y'know? Then she'll have to come back here and live all alone.
Fine. Hi! Yes, I'd like to order a large pizza.
Oh no-no-no-no-no, I'm still waiting to hear from that job and the store closes at nine, so you can eat then.
Oh.
Why the hell didn't you tell me!
What, it's ok when Chandler does it?
You sure?
No it's not!
Joey I don't think you know what behalf means.
Are you sure?
Well look who's here!
Well wait a minute, what happened to Days of Our Lives?
Oh! Whoops! I'm sorry, you were talking about Emily!
I mean, it's a cat, y'know, it's a cat. Why can't they get one of those bugs, y'know, one of those fruitflies, those things that live for like a day or something? What're they called, what're they called, what're they called?
Hello, excuse me.
Diane Keeton.
Okay. Well that's pretty much all that we have-Oh! Oh! Have you ever had a virgin margarita?
What?!
Oh my God, what happened?
I just, Phoebe, said y'know thought she saw something between you guys.
OK, OK, it's my turn.
You know what?
Uh, I don't have any brothers so I don't know, but uh, did you guys wrestle?
What?
Music. Very nice.
Okay, come on-Joey, I'll buy you a new one! All right? We'll go down to the store right now and we'll-we'll get you a new chair.
Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, this is so stupid! I mean, I gave Barry up, right? I should be happy for them! I am, I'm happy for them.
You put these on my desk!
Ooh, I've been better...
What?!
Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.
Why would I have to sleep with you?
Ohh! Okay!
Yeah, but umm... Yes, but, Fonzie was already cool, so he wasn't hurt, right?
And Joey....
Joey! Sit down!
I was laughing! You made me laugh!
Well, I don't get it, but she wanted me to give you her phone number.
Bye.
You mean, you mean 30 days?
Oh, thank God.
My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce. But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them. But you know what, you know what the good news is? I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours.
Joey, what are you talking about? You're a terrific actor.
Yeah, yeah, you go talk to your friend. You tell him, "Nice try."
So-so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom?
I'm sorry, as I was saying the store number is wrong, and I'm sorry but that's... Oh my God!!
You're right, you're right. I should just tell her the truth.
Here you go.
Oh, honey, don't worry. She's gonna make it on time.
Pheebs, what-what are you doing?
Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?!
No, no, ACC-cept that.
Um... my... father.
I can not believe he would do that to Mon-Whoa! Joey, do they know that we know?
I've never lived like this before.
You.
I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!
Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!
Oh, yeah, I had too. There was never any parking by the Psychology building.
No, it's been three nights in a row.
Oh yeah, Joey broke it. Had to get rid of it.
Oh, wait yes, but I can't eat too much. Paul is taking me out to dinner tonight, he said he has a big surprise planned.
Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!
Hey Ross? Umm, I just ran into Caitlin in the hallway and-and uh, you must be getting better at this flirting stuff than I thought.
Yeah?
Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldn't move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets.
Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I don't like guys with boring jobs.
No, no, I mean, no, c'mon you guys, I mean, c'mon look it's only eleven thirty. Let's just talk, we never just hang out and talk anymore.
Uh-huh, go on.
Ow. Ow. Ow.
I gotta go!
Okay. Switch places with me! Switch places with me! Come on! I'll go under, you go over!
Oh, I would love some. But y'know what? Y'know what? Let's not drink it here. I'm feeling kinda crazy. You wanna go to Newark?
Oh, Phoebe, are you still on hold? I was supposed to call my Dad back like two hours ago.
That's a line from the show too!
Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life.
We're just really...very excited about this charity event that we have to go to.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Umm, maybe you can start with, "Chandler, even though we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more."
Hey! Hey! Hi! Hey-hey-hey, I'm Rachel! From upstairs? The ones with all the pizza?
Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju- Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look, look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel, but it isn't me, it's not me. And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but you just have to give me a chance too...
I mean we're not, we're not gonna live together anymore?
Go!!
No, no no no, don't need to know the details.
Y'know, I know it's totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common, and we don't even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd....
We do?
And heels.
Done.
Monica, can Phoebe borrow your green dress?
What?!
Oh, that must be it.
All right!
All right! Y'know what? That's it! You wanna do it?! Let's do it!
So, um, did she...
Oh. Oh my God, is that Phoebe?
Look Joey, I'm sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gotta tell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher.
Okay, I'll see you back at home, if I ever get a flight out of here.
Tommy's supposed to be here soon, we're going to lunch.
That's right!
Hardy Boy.
Hey!
Ugh!
Yes!
Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!
You get away from me!! You sick, sick, sick, sick-o!!
Well, because of us! Because of our history.
Ohh, well, isn't that just lovely. That's something the two of you will be able to enjoy for a really, really, really, really, really long time.
Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos
Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how long, okay, you don't just give up something like that.
I will wake you up in a way that's proved very popular in the past.
No, I'm just....
Are you serious?
Hey Mon!
Why?
Yeah, it is.
Someone? I brought people. Mr. Thompson, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, this is Mr. Thompson. He's the head of my department.
No, no, no, wait! Okay, okay. Don't! I'll go, I'll go!
Okay, you're right. You're right. You can't help me.
Oh, look, wish me luck!
You get your messages!
Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.
Oh no, you're the best.
And-and what else?
Your company has a fine foods division?
Basketball!
So, it's pretty late, you're probably uh, not still planning on. . .
Okay, now what was that all about? Is it-does it not taste good? Let me try it.
What did you get her?
Ow!
You let Joey drive it?!
Umm, listen, I'm gonna need to take a rain check, my roommate is just really sick. Okay? Bye! Honey, listen, I know, I know things seem so bad right now.
OK, well, bye-bye again.
What do you, what do you mean?
No! No-no, I love it. Thank you.
Ok, I will have the uh, side salad.
What-wh-what so we'll just stay married forever?!
You could.... say you're sorry to her mom.
Let me tell you something. As a woman there is nothing sexier than a man who does not want to have sex.
I'll call the super.
I also said number one.
Pheebs...
No, was he any good in it?
Probably just the first half.
Ohh! My God! Barry!!
Well, Chandler, you're gonna have to tell him.
Thank you.
Oh, I'm sorry.
All right, cut, let's pick again, pick again.
Hi!
Ohh, ohh.
Oh, I know...
Ow!
No! Ross, come on! No! Listen, look I thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, Ross, is we can not stay married.
Anyway, there's this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren bought a table, so I kinda have to go...
Yeah! Okay, two larges coming right up!
Oh my gosh, wow. Monica. Oh my god. Mom. This is so great.
Yeah, sure, okay. Okay.
What?
Joey, just ignore the boats all right? We're not finished with the lesson yet.
Oh Daddy, no he didn't mean anything by that, he really didn't.
Oh wow. Are you in trouble.
Hi! Hi Ben!
Hi.
Macadamia nut?
Oh my God! The millionaire's here!
Chandler, what did she say?
Okay.
Hi, Mindy. Hi, it-it's Rachel. Yeah, I'm fine. I-I saw Barry today. Oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me. No, no, it's okay. I hope you two are very happy, I really do. Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end up getting married and having kids- and everything- I just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose. Okay, I know it was a cheap shot, but I feel so much better now.
What was the book?
You seem to really like her.
Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.
Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.
Oh..Go..Oh..and I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren. If she finds out that I lied to her, she is going to hate me even more. Phoebe!!
Oh damnit!
Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?
Honey, you got a little thing on your...
What?!
Noo! Maybe! I, I don't know.
I guess you weren't there.
Ooh, it was only okay.
Up!
Aw honey stop! It's not that bad.
It was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! He was like a, like a bigfoot or a yeti or something!
Hey, uh, Joey?
Ahhhh!
I'll say.
Oh my God! Joey!
What is that noise?
So, he's on the show, he knows what happens.
I'm just visiting my good friend Carol.
Ohhhhhhhh God.
I didn't... I never said that.
All right, fine, but don't get mad at me. It's-it's just a little hard to believe.
Oh my God! Oh my God!! That is like the third most prestigious soap opera award there is!
Hey Chandler!
Ahh.
Hi Pheebs!
Yes! He has a naked picture of Monica! He takes naked pictures of us! And then he eats chicken and looks at them!
Really?!
So?
Oh, oh, and hey-hey-hey, those little spelling tips will come in handy when you're at home on Saturday nights playing Scrabble with Monica!!
Yeah!
Yes I did! And I put a little Post-It on it that said, "Must go out today," and underlined today three times and, and then I put a little heart in the corner because I didn't want to seem to bossy.
Yeah, this is Tag. Tag, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
Okay.
I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phone...
Joey, where did you learn that word?
Yeah! Can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our apartment back?
It's okay. Sometimes, things don't work out the way you'd thought they would.
Monica, you don't even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!
Remember?! We-come on both had the sarongs on, and we had the-the coconut bikini tops...
All right, Julie.
Throw in the duck too!
Yeah, and you don't mind if I call, because you only want good things for me.
Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.
She is not Rachem. What the hell's a Rachem? Is that some stupid paleontology word that I wouldn't know because I'm just a waitress.
You just said it!
Oh. Oh! I can do it!
I don't know, you thought 'See you Saturday' was funny. Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with. You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.
Yeah, who's gonna eat all our food, and tie up our phone lines, and - is that my bra? What the hell you doin' with my bra?
Oh but look! That's gonna leave a stain!
You're not an artist.
Hey!
Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop.
Oh my God! What happened?
Yeah, right.
I, I didn't say any... I sw... I did not say anything, I swear. He stopped by.
Oh, let me see! Oh, God, is he just the sweetest thing? You must just want to kiss him all over!
Oh yeah.
I meant er, young, young, I meant young, young to be a doctor. Oh good, Rach.
No, listen to me. I fell for you and I get clobbered. You then fall for me and I again, somehow, get clobbered. I'm tired of being clobbered, ya know, it's, it's just not worth it.
Oh, I'm sorry. You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you. I mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy. What? What do you want? Do you want my blessing?
Well, there's you.
No. Thank you.
I know! I know, she says it's all mass-produced, nothing is authentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff. So come on, she's gonna be here any second! Can we please just cover this up with something?! Please?
Not unless different means the same.
Yeah. Hmmmm.
What?
Oh yeah. All right, back to work.
Huh. Well, y'know that's actually a really good idea, because that way they'll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too.
The nights are the hardest. But then the day comes! And that's every bit as hard as the night. And then the night comes again...
That is it! You just barge in here, you don't knock
What?
Well, it was all Ross's idea.
Oh... Oh, Pheebs.
Honey, he's about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. I'm just sorry we don't got popcorn.
Y'know?
...hormones, yeah.
Rome. Jerk missed his flight.
No. Nothing.
Well of those things that you said in the interview, I mean if you believe any of them, I must not be a very good assistant. Y'know what? I am just gonna pack up my desk, and I will be gone by the end of the day! Well, I guess there's no use to me sticking around 'til the end of the day!
OK!
No, she had to have just taken that test because I took out the trash last night.
Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't wanna...
Oh hi!
Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?
Oh, Joey, look who it is.
What's-what's going on? Phil's really pissed!
Okay? You ready?
Oh there is no way.
Yes, I realize that...
What's the matter?
Oh, it's the best! So, umm how's Monica?
Ow! Ross!!
Yeah, like a chimney.
Op.
He doesn't speak much English.
Yes, you do. When we left, you said, "got the keys."
What time is it?
Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good.
Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.
Phoebe, his music could not get any worse. There are rats in the basement that are hanging themselves.
I'm not paying for half of that! I'm only staying here until my apartment gets fixed.
Oh we were, but that was just a , I mean that was just a big drunken mistake.
Yes, Joey, I remember, she's annoying, but you know what she's-she's his girlfriend now. I mean what can we do?
Closure, that's what it is. Closure. Hello, excuse me. Excuse me, hel. . . woo
I came with Paul!
Anything?
Hi!
Alright you guys, I'm takin' off my shirt.
Yeah! Remember I got that uh, gala.
Oh, y-yeah, so, you-you love me!
Ahhhh....
No, you have it, really, I don't want it-
All right, all right, all right. Last night, I had a dream that, uh, you and I, were...
Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!
Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and...
Bye.
Ohh, OK, OK, OK, well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.
14?
Hi!
OH MY GOD!!!
Ugh!
No well, no it's not that bad, y'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up.
Oh, hi!
No.
Isn't it incredible?! Monica and Chandler, gettin' married.
I just purchased the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000.
Okay.
Zelner! Right! I knew that! I really, really want this job and I think, I think I would be really good at it.
I hope it's still funny when you're in hell.
...Jack from downstairs?
Thanks!
This place is amazing.
OK, OK, that is my favorite sweater, that is my third date sweater.
...I think that bitch cracked my tooth.
Chandler!! Promise me, you will end it.
Yeah, yeah I think I'm gonna find my own place.
No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?
Joey, God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees!
This one?
Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.
Well, then I lost it. You buy me one!
Well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with Capri pants.
Agh, it was the graduation from hell.
Yes, and I know that you'd say no if he asked you, but I'm sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin.
Ohh, what is in that?
Yeah. Your teeth? Yes, I saw them from outside. You guys are never going to believe this. But, Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren.
Noooo... the interview! She loved me! She absolutely loved me. We talked for like two and a half hours, we have the same taste in clothes, andoh, I went to camp with her cousin... And, oh, the job is perfect. I can do this. I can do this well!
Really? You don't say, because mine was licked on by kittens.
Okay, a thousand.
No-no, I bought those.
Well since I'm movin' out and-and you're so beautiful...
Bye hon.
No, it's all right, you can just drop the act Tommy. I know what's going on here. Your Danny's wingman right? You guys are best buds. Frat bros!
He-he said Rachel, right? Do you think I should go up there?
Yeah, Monica's settin' me up.
Honey wait, Joey, I'm sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it...
And your lap does not count! Okay? Come on help me move this.
Okay, you gotta give me some of your piece.
All right, you know what? This isn't funny anymore. There's something about me on that piece of paper and I want to see it.
What? Shut up! We're winning!
Let's go to lunch.
Umm, I said I thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that I like your tiney-tiny touchie.
Who's this from?
What?! Chandler, what is the matter with you?!
Yeah, I admit it. I have a crush on you, and uh, and, and I know that's crazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing I want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now.
I know, but it's just it's the first time, and I just don't want her to think that because I didn't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know?
No honey, we're sorry, we didn't mean it. I love you. I love you.
Oh well, you don't want to do that now?!
Really?
It's left sweetie, but that's okay sweetie, that's a tough one.
Yeah!
You were with Julie?
All right, will you, will you at least tell him how hollow and unsatisfying this, dating tons of women thing is!
Ross, didn't you ah, play soccer in High School? Oh no wait, that's right. You just organized their game schedules on your Commodore 64.
Okay!
OK, so that's... that's what, two bottles? And yet somehow we went through five?
But, but?
Yes of course, absolutely! You're right. I'm sorry.
Great, people having sex, that's just what I need to see.
Hm-m.
Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?
Well, things change.
Chandler, there's a guy right over there.
What do you mean?
Aw, thanks!
Ugh! Joey, I have to go.
Then what's gonna happen?
Go on! Go on.
Oh, are you sure you're ok?
Okay. Oh wait! One more thing umm, do-do we still need to uh settle the question of "us?"
Yeah.
Okay.
I-I am not uptight-Hey-hey-hey-oh-oh! Listen, I am not uptight, man.
So, how was the party?
Hey.
Have you ever seen so much crap?
Where's Chandler?
Oh, isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula.
Okay! So, we'll just stay married.
Yeah. No. And you know what? Nobody even saw!
Petty...
What, so you go over there, you tell him you think he's cute, what's the worst that could happen?
Well, it's my cat.
I'm so dead serious. I'm totally serious.
Mon, Ethan called again. Mon?
Umm, when were you gonna tell me that you're going out with Chip Matthews?
Hey, Mom? Having fun?
Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you're sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
Okay, they are.
Y'know what Ross? You're not going anywhere. You're gonna sit right here. I'm gonna make you a cup of tea and we're gonna talk this thing whole out. All right? Hey, Dave!
Hey!
All right.
Yes! And please tell her to bring a cake!
Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!
Oh, well maybe there was a dog lookin' at him.
Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I'm just glad we didn't do anything stupid.
Oh, thanks.
Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.
Okay! Okay! Here!
Will you stop calling it your apartment!
I think you should definitely go out with this guy.
Oh, y'know I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. I--Wow. My God, so creamy. Oh my God, this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. Where did you get this?
Yeah.
Pheebs?
Okay, well, that's one less thing we have to do on Monday.
Uhh, the mailman, the super.
Bzzzz.... I love you, Ross.
Oh, Phoebe, do I wanna hear this?
Well, it was a little extravagant, but I a pretty good deal.
Oh, no! No you guys! Come on, you don't have to do that! I'm happy for him! I am! I really-I'm-I'm happ-I'll work on it.
No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look. See look, men, carrying the bag.
Oh, good point.
Goodbye, baby.
Okay fine! I'll-I'll just tell her it's an antique apothecary table, she doesn't have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at this little drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs.
Yeah, right. Sure!
Yeah, I'm just mad!
And Monica, what are you going to make?
Yeah. Yeah, I-I-I see the scare. Listen, Paul, I think this is really great that-that y'know, you shared your feelings. It's really, it's beautiful, but umm, what do you say we go share some food?
Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama.
Okay, oh, here's what you do. Just act like everything around you turns you on.
Phoebe! It's 6 o'clock in the morning! Why aren't you at Gary's?
Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!!
What?
Awww, no, it's okay, we've actually known for a while.
Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this.
Ross! Stop it! Come on!
Um, Pheebs, so, you guys just dont get along?
Well, I'd have to say gay.
No!! No! He's not married, or involved, with anyone!
I uh, I have two tickets to the Knicks game tonight if you're interested, just as a thank you for this week.
Hi.
Oh, I know.
Oh my God.
Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?
Ohh, so no sign of Emily huh?
Hey! Hi!
That's not true!
Ohhh!!!!
And there's a peach cobbler warming in the oven so the plate's gonna be hot but that shouldn't be a problem for you.
No! They didn't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems?
Yeah, I guess. I-I... I mean, do-do you think we're ever gonna have that?
Oh, what are you going to do?! Are you gonna go run tell Monica?! Are you gonna tell Joey?! No! Because then you will have to tell them what we did! We are desert stealers! We are living outside the law!
Because they're people.
I mean, y'know I'm just gonna have to accept it ...
OK.
Oh, I read that in high school.
Hey! Hey-hey, now this was no one's fault Pheebs. Okay? It was an accident.
Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's? Oh! Ok, ok, ok, I just really, uh, I just really need to not be with you right now.
Well, I'm gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy.
No! So I can be by myself. Y'know? Have a little alone time.
What?
All right!
Ooooh! Wow!! Oh, hi.
Yeah!
Oh, that's great. Look at that.
Yeah, she's...
God, I'm not lame, okay. I can do something. I can throw, would you let me throw, come on this is my game too.
All right! Ross, do you think it's easy for me to see you with somebody else?
Whoa, wait, listen, I think I'm just gonna talk to Ross about what he think it meant.
And then, I don't know, I mean you'd pull me really close to you so that, so that I'd be pressed up, you know, right against you. And, um, it would get kind of sweaty and uh, and blurry, and then it's just happening.
Uh... I don't know.
That's all right.
Yes!
Oh, come on now, don't keep me waiting. Get those clothes off! But, I would keep that helmet on because you're in for a rough ride!
What?!
Hi.
Okay! All right, pick a half.
Yeah. Hi Mark!
For every night that you're asleep before I get home from work...
Did he call? Did Mark call?
Ross, I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City.
And you know which one we should see? The 1996 Tony award winner. Do you happen to know the name of that one?
Gunther, I quit.
No.
Hello, Chip.
So now what have we agreed?
She was kinda stupid. You're right. All right, I'm just gonna go on the date. I'm gonna go on the date. That is the new plan.
Yeah, right. Look at you, you're practically giddy.
Yeah! It's weird. But the thing is need to find a date.
Ohh! Thank God! Where was it?
That's also the smaller piece. Okay, there you go. Enjoy your half my friend, but that is it. No sharing. No switching, and don't come crying to me if you eat your piece to fast. Oh!!!!
Yeah, well, I gotta work, I'm sorry.
Yeah.
You idiot!!
You guys, I'm telling you, when she runs, she looks like a cross between Kermit The Frog and The Six Million Dollar Man.
Hi!
Oh my God, Phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?!
No! No! No! No it's not! No it's not! Come on! Phoebe, ours is totally different! I mean we don't have the... We don't have the...that lamp! And-and that screen is y'know, on the other side.
OK.
Thank you.
Oh yeah, they're really great! Aren't they?
Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about. Hey.
Hi!
Oh Ross, would you stop, you got me, I'm dating you.
Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from Fame. Ready to go to the movies?
Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica.
Hey Pheebs, can I talk to you over here for a second?
Well thank you, you too.
And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!
I believe it.
Oh, I don't know. I guess it's not about no guys, it's about the right guy, y'know? I mean, with Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat. With Paolo, that's all there was, was heat! And it was just this raw, animal, sexual...
What? Monica, they are cute, they are doctors, cute doctors, doctors who are cute!
Fine! I'm sorry for your loss!
No, you know what, it's late, everything's gonna be closed. Why don't we just do it another night?
She didn't hang up either!
Um, this is gonna sound kinda goofy but uhhm, my friend over there, who cooks by the way, um, she thinks you're cute.
Ross's what?
Hey!
I don't care! I don't care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it's actually ended. And, I don't care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!
What am I making him by the way?
Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't miss that.
'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.
Well I've had it.
Well neither do I!
Oh! I have your key. Here you go.
Petty...
Ross, it's too hard.
Interesting.
What?
Hi.
I just, I feel, I-I just...
Why do you care about the guy who won the Paris trip?
Yeah. Well. Hey uh Joe, would mind going over to Chandler's bedroom and get that book back that he borrowed from me?
Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be...
I had one glass.
How long?
Phoebe, it's okay. I like living with Joey.
You don't tell a guy that you're looking for a serious relationship! You don't tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!
Well mainly because he's kissing that other guy.
Hmm.
No! Wait! Come on!
Wow! If only more people knew.
Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know? Y'know what I mean, like dubbies? And I actually, I thought to myself, "Wow, those guys are crazy!" But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.
What?
Oops. Sorry! Well, good thing you number all of them, huh?
No, I've just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up?
Okay. Umm, well, first I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you.
Bye-bye Julie.
You mean the mom you met in Montauk. She was a cat?!
What?
No. Sorry.
Well try to keep it down.
You brought a carrot?!
Well y'know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time they're 40, they marry each other.
Yeah!
Yeah, it's just y'know...
Well, Phoebe that's fine because I'm not moving.
Here. I thought you might be cold.
I don't have any issues with my Father.
Oh, Ross, c'mon. It's my fault, I almost lost your...
I'm talking about a bet, winner takes all.
Hi!
Hello!
Okay. Happy birthday Grandma! It's better to be over the hill then buried under it. All our love Monica and Chandler. That's funny, yeah!
And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!
What the hell was that?!
Oh.
Umm, well let's see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw.
Who gave you that hickey?
Shut up that was my friend Melissa from college.
I'm more than okay, I am really, really happy! Wanna know why?
No. I can't, you're a totally different person to me now. I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. God, and now I just can't stop picturing with her, I can't, it doesn't matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. It's just changed, everything. Forever.
Okay, well then how about puberty! Come on, that's always a painful time! Y'know your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your hand in warm water while you're sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag.
Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank God Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy and wouldn't shut up.
No way. No way did you do this.
Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out.
Yeah?
Oh! Ross is sooo great!
Sagittarius?
Oh my God.
Yeah.
I'm so not impressed. Everybody snacks when they shop.
Okay, fine.
Uh great! How do you feel about Diet Coke?
Oh god.
Okay, Phoebe, honey, you gotta be kidding. I mean, you know you cannot keep one of these babies!
Oh, I went to have pizza. With Danny.
Okay!
No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one.
No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special.
Oh, of course!
Yes it is.
Oh! No, not really.
Closer than here?
OK, you wanna play? OK, let's play, let's play.
Yeah, you like that baby? May we help you?
Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right, no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you really want to get back into that?
Jeez!
Yeah.
All right, I'll see you guys later.
Joey!
"...marenge, thank you honey, and do the cha-cha. And while she like to be a star, Tony always tended bar. At the, wait, wait, everybody.."
All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.
Come on Phoebe! Don't be such a goodie-goodie!
No, you're not an idiot, Ross. You're a guy very much in love.
Oh, God, he's such a pig,
Impressive.
Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!
Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship! But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him! Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest! Okay, you go!
Rub it.
Oh, hi.
No, I-I just don't know how you decide who to hire. I mean I've got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot of experience and then there's this guy...
So, whaddya think George is like?
Ross, she's gonna start getting ready soon!
Well, what is the other reason?
How is she?
Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table.
He's coming over! He's coming over!
Well, well um, you know, these movies are offensive and uh, degrading to women and females. And uh, and the lighting's always unflattering. And, Monica help me out here.
What do you mean, you fold? Hey, come on! What is this? I thought that 'once the cards were dealt, I'm not a nice guy.' I mean, what, were you just full of it?
What?!
What?
Pheebs? Could you get that? Please?
All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting.
Whoa! What?! Why?!
I could not have done this without you.
No, I don't.
Hi!
Hey, Sophie!
Really?
Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy, y'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?
Yeah. Who's workin' for you babe?
Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious.
It's not funny, this is actually my job.
Oh!
Honey, come on, I have to be at work in like ten minutes Oh, all right, well it's not like I'm employee of the year or anything.
The bll is drrbing!
Oh, wow! Congratulations, that's quite a waste of time.
Nooo! Hello? Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much. Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really.
Yeah, but it's okay, because when Ross left Mark came over.
I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night.
Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience!
Hi. Well hey, you don't - you don't think they're kind of cool?
Oh, stop that! Don't kid about that! Will all the stars be there?
Sit down!
Alright, just put your hands out and I'll back up into them.
Oh, I know, I know, it's-it's so, it's so totally like, "Whoa! Can we do this?" Y'know, I mean, but I mean it just feels right! Don't you think? It does! I mean, it just feels right, don't you think?
Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, she's gonna get over this, y'know? I mean, so you said my name! Y'know you just said it 'cause you saw me there, if you'd have seen a circus freak, you would've said, "I take thee circus freak." Y'know, it didn't mean anything, it's just a mistake. It didn't mean anything. Right?
well, now, wait a second, who did I just put as my "In case of emergency" person?
No?
Oh my God! My dog died!
Oh God, even his knock is boring.
Yeah sure, iced tea would be great.
Ohh! Me too!
Well, why doesn't he practice with a girl?
No! You guys can't leave yet! You have to stay, we-we got the whole big thing planned!
Yeah and there's really cute guys there.
Oh yeah! Y'know, if it's not a headboard, it's just not worth it.
I bet 20.
It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!
Okay, Chandler!
Well, Ross said my name.
Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!
Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me. I'm a laundry virgin.
Oh that's right. You're the talker. Anyway uh, great idea! Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues.
Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got all over head!
I don't know. Who would I have to sleep with?
Well, I-I could live without it.
Well-well, I don't know Ross-really?
No-no-no, no, honey please, I've got, I've just have so much to deal with.
Yeah. Ahh, here's a box of your stuff.
Yeah!
Y'know what else is really great about him, oh, what is the word for the adult that doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom?
Oh, I am sorry...
Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady.
What?
Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone.
That was surreal. Okay, what do think? Are you interested at all?
Ross! What are you... I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really likes you.
I did.
Let me, let me get you some wine!
Really?
Yeah, yeah, I know.
I can't, I gotta go.
Oh! It's you. Hi.
Okay.
I know, I know. And oh, and this time Chip promised that-that this time it will last at least for an entire song!
Oh well, hello. This is your lucky day Mr. Bowmont, the uh gentleman day sailer as just become available again and I believe that you made a bid of $18,000.
Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided thisthis whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea.
He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, ESPN! Just once and a while, have it on in the background. Ooh, this one was Pierce Brosnan!
Hi!
No.
No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.
Seriously, it's moving!
That's funny.
It's not Christmas!
Hey!
Fourth gear!!
Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?
Oh good. Ahhh! My God, sorry!
That's right! You do what the hand says!
Well, wait a minute, you're the boss! Why don't you just yell at them? Or, fire them?
I know.
Run Phoebe run.
What? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what's the matter?
Well, wait a minute! The puss is good! It means it's healing!
This is just occurring to you?
That's what I said! Thank you for being so nice.
Both of you?
Okay, calm down, here they are.
Oh, right, that's me!
Uh-huh.
I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great.
Well, he didn't say, but it was a fire. I'm guessing not very good. Come on, we gotta go!
Uh-huh.
Oh, me too.
Have fun!
Ooh, Phoebe's here! Okay, let's turn out all the lights and we'll just watch the movie!
Okay. Oh wait! Umm, did you send those contracts to Milan?
I haven't seen him in so long!
Um-hmm.
So, did you shave your legs?
Oh!!
Okay well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute!
Okay!
Wow... Wow!
Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Because-I'm sorry, all right. Because y'know what? She didn't want me-not important. The point is, I was right. Your decision. Okay? I was right. Your decision.
Ohh, I just don't think I have enough left on my credit card.
Oh, what a fun office.
Okay, okay, okay.
Ahhhh.
You remember not having sex in high school, right?
Yeah, you know what we should all do? We should play that game where everyone says one thing that they're thankful for.
I cannot believe that you didn't tell me that we are still married!!
Hi! So I'm out having lunch at Monica's and this guy starts talking to me, and it turns out he works for a buyer at Bloomingdale's and there happens to be an opening in his department. So I gave him my phone number and he's gonna call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview!
Oh, um, no, no, no, no excuse me, hello. Hi. My friend ordered an onion, not an olive, and uh I ordered a rum and Diet Coke, which I don't think this is.
Ok, we never shoulda talked about this.
Great! Thanks!
Uh-huh.
Oh, by the way Mon, I don't think the mailman liked your cookies. Here are the ornaments your mom sent.
So umm, what time are you supposed to leave?
Well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married?
No. No. Every thing's--they're fine. Great pizza. But it's uh, actually umm my friend Ross. He uh, just gets really nervous when he's flirting.
But I told you, I didn't have the time!
No, just singing.
Why? I love that thing.
Okay.
Oh my...
Look at that!
What, so I can't lokk nice? There might be doctors there.
Yeah... I, uhh... I have a... I have a date.
Uh, yeah, if you want too.
Yeah.
And now, y'know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so..
I use my breasts to get other people's attention.
Oh, I can't watch this.
Uh, I will see you... and I'll raise you. What do you say... want to waste another buck?
What?!
Uhhh, yeah. But it's not obvious why.
Why not?
Oh.
Summer catalogue!
Okay.
Oh, could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?
I mean that's unbelievable.
Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?
Hm-mmm.
Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.
Boy, you really can't stand to lose, can you? Your whole face is getting red... little veins popping out on your temple...
Hey!
Take it like a man, Ross!
You don't pick me! You're stuck with me!
Uh-huh.
Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?
What's going on?
Okay.
Ohh Tag, umm...you're such a great guy and we have sooo much fun together but I don't-I don't...
Get the hell out of there, y'know?
Monica, betting the apartment, I don't know about this.
No, I know, they're from me. Look you guys this is not good. I mean we have enough trouble with guys stealing our wind without taking it from each other.
Oh, somebody will.
That's great! Wow man, so Joey must've really taught you some stuff huh?
My drinking?
Y'know what? I've just had it with high school boys! They are just silly. Silly, stupid boys! I'm going to start dating men!
Yes you do. You think of it as your apartment, and I'm just somebody who rents a room.
Hm-mmm.
I still don't get how you know when it's false labour.
Oh, I called them. And when they ask me what I saw, I can be very generous or very stingy.
That was not funny!
I can not believe he would do that to Mon-Whoa! Joey, do they know that we know?
Yeah, sure.
Yeah.
Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here. What if the baby needs him?
Okay. Okay. Joey, it's okay. Settle down.
Y'know I can't believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!
Ok, Ross, try to hear me. Ok, I, hey, I'm not gonna lie to you. Ok, it was good with Paolo.
Well, from me. And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite.
Oh my God Phoebe, this is impossible! We can't do this by Friday! We have to find a place. We have to invite people! We have to get food! There's just too much to do! It's impossible! We can't do it! We cannot do it! We cannot do it!
I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? ..Ross?
Why's that?
Wow! It looks like the Easter Bunny's funeral in here.
Uh- which one of us are you talking to there, Barr?
Yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps, right?
Oh my God.
Yes, so close. Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an emotional and difficult time, for all of us. But by any chance did Joanna send any paperwork your way before... it happened.
Op! Wait, you dropped a pea.
Ohh, I'm gonna be on the news!
Oh, god, I can't believe one of us actually has one of these.
What? You just click when they click.
Because I'm married. That's right, I am a married woman! And I came to a TV star's apartment to have an affair! Uck!
Thanks, Mon.
Ok. Look uhh, Mon I'm, I'm really sorry.
Why aren't you at work?
Hi!
You're welcome.
Joey.
Actually, what I think you said was, "don't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen."
Oh my God.
Hey, Pheebs, quick question for ya.
Oh yeah. I used to babysit him. Hey, how's his dad?
Hey guys! What's up?
Wow, he's cute, Pheebs! But I thought you just started dating that Kindergarten teacher.
What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps lying to me! That's it! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go over there and confront them right now!
Thank you. Hello? I still don't get it.
Monica!!!
Ah.
Do you guys know any cute guys?
Well, don't look at me! My hair's straight! Straight! Straight! Straight!
Hey you!
Joey, would you just come out here and stop being such a baby!
But y'know what, if you think it's gonna be okay we'll just work out a system. Y'know, it'll be like college, I'll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign, "Come back later, I'm gettin' lucky."
All right, look, here's the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. So, I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.
Yeah, love. It's a tricky business isn't it?
Thanks!
Hi!
You dont even have cats.
Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.
No seriously, y'know the contracts I gave you, did you overnight them?
Oh, did you not want people to know that?
Both of them are here, both of them, both of them are here?
OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus- Ow. That hurt
Chandler!! Are you gonna call her!
Okay. Wait! Wait!
What if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and I answer and we start talking and we fell in love. I mean wouldn't that be a great story? Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.
You're jokin' right?
Monica, what should I do?
Hi, sure!
Oh my God! Oh my God!!
Oh, y'know what? I can't. I have to have dinner with that Melissa girl.
Hey! What's up Mon?
Oh, hi.
Oh, I did!
But your divorce isn't even final yet.
Oh umm, y'know I lent it to Joey and I never actually got it back.
Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right.
No! Really, no, please, please, that's, that's okay.
Nice seizing. . . gel boy.
Pancho Vila?
So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?
Since when do take naps in that position. Oh God Monica, tell me you were waiting for a guy! Please tell me you were waiting for a guy!
Yes, okay, oh, by the way, I just gotta say, I think it's really nice of you that even after you've moved, you still keep storing that stuff for Joey!
Wait, how long?
Time is money my friend?
Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women.
OK, gook luck.
Yeah it is, mostly because I get to boss people around, which I just love to do.
Oh, look at the little cat! Look at it!
Joey! Come here! Come here!
Okay, you want me to stop at the ATM?
Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.
What are you ever gonna use that for?!
Oh!
Hello? Who are we spying on?
Me either. Umm, all right, first thing I need you to do is go downstairs and find a women named Hilda and tell her to go home.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!
Phoe-be!!
Well, hello, Mr. Rachel!
I'm not gonna gooo, so I think that will accomplish the not going.
OK, OK.
I'm so happy and not at all jealous.
No! Nothing!
All right, you're the boss. I guess I gotta do what you tell me.
What?
What's this.
Ross?
Hey!
Did you ever do the-the Leia thing?
No, it was just the three of us.
We don't want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle.
I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh, this is our cart.
No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge step down!
And uh, yeah, I didn't really, I didn't want to say anything, but it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And uh, and I thought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a, as a compromise we decided first to get married, and then to eat a lot of grapes. So umm, sorry I got us into this mess.
Hi guys! This is Josh. Josh, these are my friends, and that's Ross.
All right!
Oh good, great! I'll-I'll keep that in mind.
Monica, this is Dan , one of the guys that we're gonna be going out with on Saturday. Uh Dan, Monica.
Oh right.
It's the same story.
Huh.
I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too late.
...and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!
Okay.
What're you guys doing out here?
I'm not telling you what to do! I am telling you what not to do!
Yeah, I know, I do. I really do.
Is he romantic with her?
Do I have my own castle?
A lot.
Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?
Oh, thank you.
Well that sounds fun too.
Y'know, I gotta tell ya, this really does put in a better mood.
Oh, I'm sorry.
You went shopping?! What, and then you just came in here and paraded it right under Jill's nose when you know she's trying to quit. Wow, you guys are terrible!
... the WENUS?
Oh, you-you mean your earrings?
So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?
Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend leave? Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She was in there, when I was in there?!
Come on, I don't really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying a very heavy couch.
You don't have birds.
Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in the shower?
I don't know. What do you mean last night? Nothing, nothing uh, happened last night.
Pheebs, I was wondering...
C'mon touch it.
You really, really need to get some sleep, honey.
Sure.
Yeah.
Ross, what's the matter?
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. See Phoebe, Phoebe.
Well-well, I don't know Ross-really?
Oh, he brought her back to his apartment.
Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!!!
And not one of your coupons for an hour of "Joey Love."
All right are you guys gonna come down?
So, like, you guys all have jobs?
I am so hot for you right now.
Ross said my name up there, I mean, come on, I just can't pretend that didn't happen can I?
Ok, who ordered what?
Well, I don't know. I called all the people in Monica's phone book and these are the only ones who could show up on 24 hours notice.
Kinda.
Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?
Hi.
Oooooh. : Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview!
Yeah.
Okay.
How was the beach?
Yeah I think so.
Yeah.
Hi! Wh-what are you doing here?
Oh dear God.
Uh-huh.
Oh Joey, I'm sorry I just couldn't tell her all those things you wanted me to tell her. And y'know we got to talking and I...
Who got married?!
Ross said my name up there, I mean, come on, I just can't pretend that didn't happen can I?
Oh God! This is silly, I'm gonna see you in a couple of hours!
: We have apple cinnamon...
He even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it.
What are you doing?! Get in the front!
Hmm. Kinda stepped on my point there, Mon.
Daddy, daddy, you know what, I really wanna hear more about this, I really do, but I just have, I just have to do a, some stuff.
Yeah. Well, umm.....
It's really not that big!
Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary!
Oh! What's new in sex?
I did not!
Oh thank you, Chandler, this is so great, she's gonna love me.
Ah that's great. No actually that's... That's great! That's really great! Y'know, I gotta tell ya writing, I mean writing, gets me uh, gets me kinda hot.
What-what if I marry Ross-Or Joey?
Right!
What song was that, Pheebs?
I'm going to find out if he really thinks supermodels are too skinny. Hey, Pheebs!
Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way. Here are your keys, hon.
Well, I-I-I've been on Standby for a flight home for hours.
God, he's good.
Well, it gets worse. When asked if you take initiative I wrote, "Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision," and under Problems with Performance I wrote, "Dear God, I hope not," and then uh, then I drew a little smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch.
Ohh, hi, Kim.
Oh my God!! Do it!! Honey, you've waited long enough!!
Okay. I am so hot!
Nothing, I mean, um, it is your first time with her and, you know if the first time doesn't go well, well then that's, that's pretty darn hard to recover from.
Noo.
Okay.
What?
Yeah, I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass!
That's your whole name, okay of course it is! Okay, well let's-let's just have a look-see here.
I know, but all that work you're doing to get it ready, I just...
Hey, so did everything go all right with the annulment?
Oh. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. Sorry. It's just, I'm ahh, I'm kinda excited. I'm, ahh, going to London to ahh, tell this guy that I love him and...
Hey!
Oh, yeah, well hey, welcome to our sauna.
No. She doesn't die.
Ohh, great!
Or I'll give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right, you are a tough guy. You're the toughest palaeontologist I know.
Oh, I win! He's got Barney's on his speed dial.
I think she's checking out your beehive Ross.
What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!
Pheebs, I don't think anyone's mad about that.
Okay, what's up?
Oh, my god.
I mean it's the end of an era!
Well, congratulations, so do you love her?
Hey!
Well, why shouldn't I be? I have great friends! I have a wonderful job!
Pheebs, Monica tripped me, I don't think I can ever run again, ever!
Monica, please?
Joey! Why did we have to rush out of there so fast?!
Ross, what's the big deal? So I kissed the guy!
That's right Joey, the chair angel came in and heeled your chair.
No, I knew.
Wh, Ross what do you want from me? You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?
Oh, it's just like a bloodbath in here today.
Noooo, no, I'm not mad at him. I'm.. I'm not really anything at him anymore.
Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.
Hi!
Ohh! This is so exciting! Oh God... Come and knock on my door...
What? Hey! No-no-no! This not cool! You don't even know me!
Dealer takes two. What do you bet?
Yeah! Closure. That's what it is, that's what I need. God, you're brilliant! Why didn't I think of that? How do I get that?
Oh, thank God.
Okay. Phoebe, I-I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do?
Wow.
Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, I'm sorry, but I don't think that was a romantic thing.
You look so beautiful.
Okay, so anyway I'm sittin' in my office and guess who walks in.
So. Ross, I've bugged him about this a million times, he's not gonna change.
Good different?
Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people.
Oh they're pushing! They're pushing!!
How's Ross doing? Y'know since all the Emily stuff.
Hey.
Good bye!
What were you thinking?!
Hm-mm.
Yeah hon, it can't hurt to put your name down! I mean in if two years if you're not engaged you just don't use it.
I need some milk.
Oh my God, look there's Roy Gublik.
Hi Pheebs.
No! God, would you just calm down!
Really? Mine too.
Aw, I love that.
Hi!
Oh well, too late, sorry, you already had some.
Ohhh... Okay, you were right. You were right! This was just not worth it.
Ross, I'm doing everything that I can, I've got everybody looking for him, and I- Oh! Who is it?
What?!
Oh hi, Mr. Wineburg, hi Mrs. Wineburg.
No-no-no! No-no-no! Please Ross, I can't! I can't do it! It's just gonna freak me out!!!
Burning's good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn.
He carries a briefcase.
Umm, okay, I think I'm-I'm just gonna-just gonna say it. Just gonna say it. Uhh, I'm still in love with you Ross.
Ok.
You're not the man who left the cell phone.
You have no respect for anybody's privacy!
Hi.
Over here!
Meeting Julie.
Oh my God, look-look he's taking off her clothes!
Well, isn't that a good thing? You said you were sick of this.
Hi Joey, how ya doin'?
Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!
Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you sailor?!
I know!
Really?
And the chicken pooped in her lap. Oh, I'm so sorry. I just gave away the ending, didn't I? Oh! It's just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I can think about.
Yeah.
What?! You got us evicted!!
Oh, well, it pretty much sucked. How was yours?
Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish.
Oh.
Eavesdropping. Pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down.
Oh.
Joey...
Space cowboy!
Yeah, what?
Yes.
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh Chandler!! You guys are gonna be so happy!
That wouldn't help me.
Well, I, umm...
Umm...
What?!
Wow!
Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.
So, I love you.
Oh. Ohhhhhhhhh....
Well, I assume I'll have to take showers with him, but y'know, that's true of any job.
Happy Thanksgiving!
Credit.
Yeah, what's it about?
No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you'll have to think of something else.
We won't?
Well, maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I pass that information on y'know kinda like a public service, it doesn't mean I'm a gossip. I mean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip?
Yeah.
No no no no.
Oh it's OK. You were worth the wait, and I don't just mean tonight.
What what what what?
Ross, I have been walking around like this since the plane! I can-you have so crossed a line.
Well, I have a job interview at Ralph Lauren tomorrow!
Oh yeah, I totally agree.
Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything.
No no no, wait, I wanna see what happens.
Come on! They rushed into this thing so fast it's ridiculous! I mean, they're gonna be engaged for like what? A year? And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what they've done and they're call the whole thing off. I'm telling ya, you're gonna be dancing at my wedding before you're dancing at there's.
Yeah Pheebs, honey, she just got engaged a couple of hours ago. I doubt she's even had time to...
Hey Mon, little question for ya! How do you think this suit will look on an assistant buyer?
...the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you've grown. Y'know? I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, "Once a cheater, always a cheater." Ooh, I just wish we hadn't lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...
Let's roll!
Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag. Oh, it does work!
You are friends with Dr. Drake Remoray?
Well, it'd better not be about the apartment pants, because I just pitched the idea to my boss at Ralph Lauren and she loved it.
Ha!
Hey. Got a second?
Okay then!
Hey Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.
Hi, it's me. I've been trying to reach you all night. I feel awful. Please, Ross, you gotta know there is nothing between me and Mark. This whole break-up thing is just stupid.
Ohh... I mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that happen?
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Are they in love?
Damn!
...Monica.
Yes!
Oh my God! Calling from Rome! Bon giorno, caro mio.
It's Joshua.
Ross!
Okay, that is all you.
No, no, no, now wait, wa, wa, waa-it a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. That actually, uh, that sounds interesting.
Oh.
Hmm.
Right...
I don't know. We were watching TV, and then he pooped in Monica's shoe-
Because, uh-it has to.
What?!
The commercial?
That would be great! Wait, how long is Denise gone for?
Oh it's important!
Take the top down did ya?
Vanilla?!
Uh-oh.
Phoebe, how would you do this to me? This was all your idea.
No, there's nothing to make up, she's gonna know that I have a key to her office, I've got to get you locked up back the way you were!
Pheebs?
Do you really want an award you didn't win?
Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone.
Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce?
Hello? Oh, Pheebs! It's Phoebe!
Hi, welcome to our tropical Christmas party. You can put your coats and sweaters and pants and shirts in the bedroom.
Ohh, well I'm not totally back yet, but thank you.
Pheebs!
You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!
I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.
Look Ross, if you're so freaked out, just get in the car!
All right. All right Phoebe I will let you have him, but you owe me; you owe me big!
Great!
What?!
What? Who the hell is Emily- noooo!!
So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
No!
Uh-huh.
Ohh! It's so nice to meet you. Hello.
Just a waitress?
Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job.
Yeah. And y'know who should've shut their drapes? Is that perverted old couple two doors over.
Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day though, I got to sit in on the meeting with the reps from Calvin Klien. I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie, she ordered a ton of it. How was your day?
Uh-huh! Nice try, but you don't get that chair anymore! All right? That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap! No I take that back!
Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here!
What? No! It's not a big deal! I do that too, with my shampoo bottle.
Okay. Okay. It's-since you've never done it before you can be Monica's made of honor.
No.
Okay! Okay-okay look-no I did, I just wanted this stuff and I know how you feel about Pottery Barn. Just... Come on don't be mad.
Guess what. Ben just said his first word.
You know what else I'm not gonna miss? "I'm Monica. I wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!"
All right, so we weren't prepared!
Oh?
Yeah.
Yes!!
Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to Ross's wedding.
Well, are we all together? Like in a group?
Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!
Actually, I just wanna talk to Tag.
No-no, that wasn't me! Well, we should get started. Let me show you my underwear. The selection of underwear we carry.
I can't talk to you. I can't even look at you right now!
Oh, hi Mrs. Lynch! Is Joanna in already?
What? Wait! Why...why do you get the story?
Thank you.
Really?
I'm training to be better at a job that I hate, my life officially sucks.
Oh, uh, Joanna I was wondering if I could ask you something. There's an opening for an assistant buyer in Junior Miss...
Ohh, of course Monica's brother!
Oh, well you know who I love the most?
What-yeah-what, y'know what? I hope Emily is a lesbian.
And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.
Yes oh--Do I want sugar in my coffee? No, just some milk would be good Carol. Thanks. Okay, do you remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?
Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross?
Ooooh! Honey, well we'll find you something. Do you wanna wear my black jacket?
Ohh-ha-ha!
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I love you too.
Hi you guys.
'Okay. Okay, daddy we'll see you tomorrow night. Okay bye-bye.'
Not even with your best friend.
Hi! Thanks, hey so uh what'd you do last night?
Yeah, I do. I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear your head, I think it'd be really good.
Well yeah, sure, what's up?
Oh, Ross, relax. It's probably like two dollars for the first contraction, and then fifty cents for each additional contraction.
Okay come on Phoebe, it's nothing! Monica, come on!
Really?! Got a little crush on Tag there do ya?
Hi. I'm back.
Uh, it was very nice meeting you.
Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right there.
Thank you. Thank you so much!
Is that him again? Tell him I'd come to the phone, but my ankles are weighin' me down.
Oh, this lipstick looks just great on you.
What?
Ohh...
Oh, it's gonna be fine.
I... It just-it took me so long to get that desk organized.
Ohhh... I'm fine.
Wow, so why don't you go talk to him?
Joey! Come on! I don't wanna make any mistakes, alright? This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like "Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?"
Y'know what? I am going to do something today. I'm not just gonna sit around like some old lady. I'm gonna get something pierced. Like my uh, like my nose or my tongue or something.
Okay, but before you go, could you help me first?
Well, honey that was pretty obvious.
Oh that's right! I'm sorry! I-I am early! Finish! Please!!
Oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too?
Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice.
I'm sorry Pheebs, I guess I'm just really said that I'm leaving.
Well of course that is what I'm here for!
I don't like sitting up here! I'm just gonna over...
Noo.
Wha... forget it Ross, no, I am not gonna stand here and make a list of. . .
Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor.
Yes.
Well, y'know what, that doesn't matter.
Ross! Come on! That's all right! Fine--Okay, I have a weird thing about my eye. Can we not talk about it please?
Okay. Okay, great! Umm, okay, just turn around.
OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is very important.
Oh no, at the Grammies I always win.
There were times when it wasn't even me.
Because, I wanted to hurt you.
Well um, I don't.
Wow! What did he say?
Ah, hah-hah-hah-ho, yeah, he wishes. Oh, I'm sorry, look at me. OK, Michael, let's talk about you.
Yeah?
Uh Pheebs, we just actually kinda wanted to be alone.
Yeah, just give me a minute! Oh well, yes, I can think of one good thing.
We're not actors.
Oh my God!! You just ruined the thing I was practicing the whole way home, but I'm soo happy!
That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?
Heard what?
Ohh, thank you, thank you, thank you.
Better than Chandler.
32.
Oh yeah!
Ohh! And I'm one of them!! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!
Me? I'm great! I'm fine! I'm sooo good!! But, you know who's not great?! Men! You're a man right Ross?!
Yeah Phoebe, I completely understand.
Oh!! My God, what are you doing here?
Oh, God, ask them what they want.
Hey.
Right.
Thank God. Food.
Ooo! Oh, I forgot they made sheets!
Nothing.
Ohh!
Hi! Uhh, do you guys have plans for the weekend? Because I have my sister on hold, and she said that we could use her cabin for the weekend and go skiing. Huh? I'm asking you first, right?!. I mean I'm playing by the rules.
Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.
Ok, he's goin' to get my coat. He's goin' to get my coat. Oh my god, you guys. I can't believe this. This is unbelievable. What's that?
Oh, y'know what, I didn't want cinnamon on this.
I just y'know, I didn't expect him to be this happy so soon. Ufff. Ooo-ooh!
Absolutely not.
Ok, Chandler, Mon, there's only one bananna nut muffin left.
I promise.
No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.
Oh, you know what? Rachel.. She just left.
Oh crap!
No! No! It's just that all the people in the entire world that I want to talk to are right here.
Nobody does honey.
Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!
I dunno. Y'know to me he'll always be "Jack Geller, walks in while you're changing."
And Chandler, you're gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know Raquel can't be late.
Huh, that's funny. You look like you're gonna be the...
Alright, somebody.
Oh yeah, there you go.
Joey, why would you do that?
Okay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff.
Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Y'know, it's-it's just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don't get to keep the gifts.
I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!
Yeah, and not a very good one.
Oh.
Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit.
Yep. Oh, yeah, look you great. Oh yeah. Yeah, this looks great. Umm, so you like it?
This is Bonnie? This is Bonnie? You're Bonnie?
But Joey you don't have $20,000!
Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.
Hey, can I borrow the key to your house so I can run across the street and make a copy?
C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
Virgo?
Hey!
I'm all better now.
Oh I get it! A...man...duh!
Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me.
We're good?
Oh my god. Janice, hi!
Oh, I am so sorry.
Yeah, when I was in the bathroom I saw the window that I crawled out of at my wedding, and God, I just started thinking that I shouldn't be here, you know I shouldn't, people are going to be looking at me and judging me and, and thinking about the last time.
Oh I...
I'm gonna do it.
She has got so much going on we-we have only two options. We have Friday...
What?
Thank you. Hey-hey umm, uh, is there, is there any such thing as an annulment shower?
Gimme the keys!
But I...
Yeah. It's just gonna be too hard. Y'know? I mean, it's Ross. How can I watch him get married? Y'know it's just, it's for the best, y'know it is, it's... Y'know, plus, somebody's got to stay here with Phoebe! Y'know she's gonna be pretty big by then, and she needs someone to help her tie her shoes; drive her to the hospital in case she goes into labour.
Oh not-not so much. Umm, what-what do you, what do you mean is there something wrong with Ross?
Wh... Come on! Remember? We were on the sleeping porch! We couldn't stop giggling? And our coconuts kept knockin' together?
No, she left a message. But it-it kinda got erased. There's just something wrong with your machine.
Ohhh well. Y'know what honey? The best thing to do to get over a guy is to start dating someone else. Oh! There is this great guy you will love at work named Bob! He's a real up-and-comer in Human Resources.
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.
Well, maybe they can find a way to bring you back.
Ok, let me take these cakes back 'cause they're gonna take that out of my paycheck.
Oww!
Okay, gotta go! Wish me luck!
No! No-no-no...
A birthday party.
True story.
Fine! I judged you. I made a snap judgement. But you did it too! And you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! You can't even open up your mind for a second to see if you're wrong! What does that say about you?
Oh my God! That's Monica!!
Well, y'know, sometimes that helps.
Well you uh, you were always really good at the uh, at the uh the stuff.
What?! You kissed!
Oh, Mon, sure.
Uh-huh!
But I do not want to have everything decided for me. I spent my whole life like that. It's what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left. I, I like not knowing right now and I'm sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with me you are gonna have to deal with that.
Hi! Sorry- sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost track of time.
Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I'm doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I'm doing something that I'm actually good at. I mean. if you don't get that...
Oh yeah? Okay.
And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up?
Well neither do I!
Well, I just lost a job, and I'd like to raise the bet five bucks. Does anybody have a problem with that?
Well, he doesn't really love her. I mean, it's just a rebound thing from me.... You'll see!
Oh, that's true.
Op, but the twelfth brings a lover's spat.
You just finished?
Well, so what does he do?
HI!! Hi!
I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils.
Hi. Hey, hi! So uh, Frank and Alice wanted me to tell you that they're still outside making phone calls.
And I still have about five seconds to spare. Okay, that was about seven seconds.
No.
All right, I like that.
Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
What are you going to make?
Oh really, OK.
Ohh, okay. Wh-Ah-ha! Wait a minute. Uh Ben, I can't do it.
Hey! Hey, you guys, I finished the crossword all by myself! Hug me!
Oh, wait-wait-wait...
Okay.
That's good enough. Right? Okay, well umm, I'm gonna go look at my books!
Hey, who's this little naked guy?
You love her.
Really?
Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?
Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not.
Ooh, Pheebs, what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are?
Well, believe me, it's been a long time since I've been flung.
Okay, good. Now that since you know, when you come over would you mind actually using it?
Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it. I know it's in the apartment, but I definitely lost it.
Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but we're gonna have to get into Mr. Zelner's office. Now, he doesn't get in until 10, so he's no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.
Ohh! You did not drop any socks!
Hi!
All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now.
Well of course I do! But y'know, favorite returning character is a tough category Joey. I mean you're up against the guy who survived his own cremation.
Yeah! Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started putting some stuff together, y'know just in case...
Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing? What am I doing? This is so un-me!
I'm doin' good, baby. How you doin'?
I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!
What?!
Sorry. I'm so exited! I've been waiting for this for months! I got my hair coloured! I got new sheets! I'm making him a very fancy meal.
What?
Oh, Ross...
Hey!
Of course I packed! Monica relax! I just wanted to ask Phoebe her opinion on what I should wear tonight.
It was nice to meet you.
Hi!
I'm sure he will forgive you. Look, we have all been there! Y'know, you fight, you make up, it's just the way it works.
I dumped him.
What? Who?
Ohh that's great!
It's not a big deal!
Why?
Come on! I don't want you thinking of me like that any more!
Maybe it, maybe it doesn't have to be this tough. I mean, maybe you were on the right track with this whole, you know, spontaneous thing. I mean, women really like that.
Well y'know I was just in the neighborhood and I passed by your building and I thought to myself, "What's up with Carol and sweet, little Ben?"
Ok, Ross, Ross, ok listen, what we have is amazing.
I would love to!
Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?
You guys, does this look like something the girlfriend of a paleontologist would wear?
We need a hat..
Okay.
Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.
That is neither here nor there.
What?
You know, actually it's more like, hi.
Oh yeah! Oh my God! That is our friend! It's Naked Ross!
Oh my God! I can not believe that! I mean I don't really like it when Ross goes out with anyone, but my sister isn't that like incest or something?! Oh my God, and they're gonna have sex! Oh! Oh no what if he marries her too?! Oh this is just terrible, this is just terrible. And I can't stop it! I can't-I don't own Ross! Y'know? And Jill, she should be able to do whatever it is that she wants to do! And oh my God, I can't believe Ross is marrying my little sister, this terrible. Oh my God, this is just the worst thing that could have ever happened to me.
Well, ultimately, I was trying y'know, I-I wanted...tell him y'know, that I'm still in love with him.
Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...
There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course.
Well, I do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat.
You don't?!
..You're, you're 'mah mah mah' what?
Why would you even want to come Ross? You're a horrible skier.
Yeah, which, by the way Chandler, I would like back one of these days.
Hey, who's this little naked guy?
With Ross and my sister?
Ooh, I just wish we hadn't lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...
Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point?
Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid. Okay? Just sweep it.
Yeah and you stretch 'em out with your big old clown feet.
Oh my gosh, Joshua!
Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing.
Oh, it ended very well.
Thank you!
What?!
Huh-Wait so Joey if you get this, you're gonna be like the star of your own TV show! I mean you'll be like the Big Cheese! Or the Big Mac-Hey! You love those!
Because , because, I just heard it. I heard it, and it's ridiculous! I mean, you're married. You're-you're married and it's just ridiculous, and it's like, it's like when said it, I sort of like, I floated up out of my body, y'know? And, and-and then I heard myself say it and then the floating Rachel was like, "You are such an idiot!"
Can't I just look at the handles on them?
Wow! What's that like?
Well, Joshua's coming in tomorrow and since I don't have the guts to ask him out, I'm going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.
Y'know what? No. It's not over until someone says, "I do."
Why aren't you home yet?!
Look he doesn't have any brothers or sisters, somebody's gonna have to teach him this stuff! And I haven't taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesn't know anyway!
Ohh whoops.
What?
Yes! Did you see that?
Oh ok.
Thank God you're pretty.
Woah, woah, woah, what book is this?
So?
I know. Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that? Listen, I'm gettin' something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?
Okay, you are crazy! I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset! I mean, listen!
Why.
No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?
Monica, let it go.
It's coming from Joey!
I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.
Wow! I did not see that coming.
Hi!
Ohh, thank you.
Do what, do what?
Oh, come on! You think that's gonna work on me?! I invented that!
Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?!
What are these?
Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!
Okay Joey honey, you're doing really good! All right, now I'm just gonna need you to step to the port side. Remember? Remember how we talked about the port side?
No you don't know why!
What?
Yeah, great, you betcha!
Y'know what you should do?
You do?
Sit!
Oh my God, Melissa Warburton. I don't think I have the energy for this.
So?
Ross, no! There is no way I am leaving this room looking like this!
How can you not remember us kissing?!
Well, yeah, right, y'know what? Yeah, you're right, I mean, we no, we have our fun. Yeah! But if ......I mean, I mean like craaaazy! Y'know? Okay, all right. This is gonna, this is gonna sound y'know, a little umm, hasty, but uh, just go with it. Umm. Ugh. What if we got married?
Aside from the fact that you said you had them?
Okay, stop what you're doing, I need envelope stuffers, I need stamp lickers.....
Yeah!
Hi.
What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!
Hey he's wearing a sweater.
With ah, extra anchovies.
We should defiantly play football more often. Maybe there's a like league we could join or something.
Who is it?
Yeah.
Hi. Tag, I have a conference call today is that correct?
Ugh, how can you even ask that question?!
Okay. Okay, we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels great.
Thank you.
Ooh, the gift shop!
All right!
Ross! We broke up two years ago; you've been married since then. I think it's okay that we see other people.
Hi!
Really? It doesn't seem desperate?
You just don't look old enough to have a twenty-year-old daughter.
Ross, I don't, I just don't think it's going to fit.
You guys are unbelievable. No! He cannot come.
Said what? Exactly.
Look you guys, I have to go, I'm the Maid-of-Honor. And besides you know what I just need to be in a room again with these people and feel good about myself.
So were you guys together a long time?
Pretty much.
Are you gonna let me play?
So this is Brooklyn.
Very nice touch.
Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be... ... oh, the foot of the bed.
Are you over me?
Ah, so what are we looking at?
All right.
I, I don't have it.
Oh my God!
Uh well, uh this is a silent auction. They lay out all the stuff here and then you write down your offer and then the highest bid gets it.
Yeah, I went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two months later the couple got divorced. And now I'm not saying that there's any connection here y'know, but they did tell me that's why they got divorced.
I didn't have to, because I was wearing my 'I heart Ross' sandwich board and ringing my bell.
I'll be right there! Okay, Ross, please come on! I thought we have moved on! I thought we've gotten to a place where we could be happy for each other! I mean was that just me?
Yes it is!
No so we're protecting her.
Well, y'know this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea.
Yeah, right, he almost danced me right down that...garbage chute.
Hey.
Do you know something?
Ooh, this is soo sweet, Joey our little twinkle-toes.
So, is this just gonna be you and Carol?
Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine.
I can't do this.
Oh my God! Yes, I would love that, oh, that is soo sweet, Joey.
Yeah.
You guys wanna get some coffee?
That's fine!
Ok, while you "mmm" on it for awhile, I'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp.
Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you?
Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.
Then, we had this big, stupid fight, and I said I wanted to take a break, I don't want to take a break.
Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this.
Ross said my name. Okay? My name. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me! Okay, don't believe me, I know I'm right-do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?
Oh my God, they let you keep that stuff?!
Okay. Hey. Umm. Does everybody hate these shoes?
No, we kinda broke up instead.
Okay, hold on real quick, hold on a second let me just uh, get a little more comfortable here. Wait, now wait a second, this isn't too revealing is it?
No, you wait! This is ridiculous!
Monica, what are you doing?
Op, ice. I need ice.
Well y'know, we have 7 people and like 10 pizzas, what do you think?
There's been a teeny-teeny change in plans. It turns out that I'm not free tonight. So...
Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine.
Hey, you guys...
Huh-hoo, yeah, no, it's still basil.
Ohh!
Let me uh, let me ask you something, do wedding vows mean squat to you people?! And why is it that the second we tell you we're going out of town, bamn there you are in bed with the neighbor's dog walker?!
No. No-no-no-no.
Uh, I-I had a drink with lunch. Did those cost reports come in?
No no, 'cause mayo, that would make it gross.
Okay. We'll be right back.
No, Monica! Monica! We have to fix this!
Ross, hey you know what might make it less boring?
Marcel, this is for you. It's, uh, just, y'know, something to, um, do on the plane.
I'll take a coffee. So how was your big date last night?
Really? Really?!
Almost.
And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa.
Who is being loud?
Oh... ... Oh my God. He remembered.
Well, I...
Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that locker room stuff.
So Pheebs, what is the book about?
Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid! I had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard! Y'know you-I couldn't concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me. I mean come on, you remember what's it's like to be 19 and in love.
Well, what are you going to wear?
Um, hum.
Oh no, yeah.
Ross.
Yeah-eah-ha!
Hi!
Barry?!
Bye, Chandler.
No, it wasn't. It was actually the...
Y'know I can't believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!
But I haven't used my card in weeks!
Oh, okay.
What?
Ooooh yeah.
Oh God. Oh I can't believe Joey Tribbiani heard me throw up!
Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!
Yeah, it's kinda like a 'good luck on your first day' sort of thing. Is this actually a lunchbox?
In Human Resources!!!!!!
Oh-oh-oh, which one is Bonnie again?
Career counselor?
Oh yes, absolutely! Y'know, it's weird uh, but I had a dream last night where I was stopped by a policeman. And then he uh...well I probably shouldn't tell you the rest.
Yeah, umm, no honey.
Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.
And a nice hot cider for Monica.
Oh? Yeah! Sure!
Hi officer, was I going a little too fast?
I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.
What are you doing here?
What's Flimby's?
That is great. Hey, y'know who doesn't have to job hunt? Ross. He works at the university.
Okay that is the one we already have!
It'll never last, he's just a rebound roommate.
Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya, baby! Darnit! Ugh.
Phoebe, you're on.
Hey, do you guys have... ...hi.
Okay.
Eh. Beth dies.
Hey, you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!
I-I-I-I'm just...I'm just a good kisser!
Monica, what should I do?
Yeah, at the lecture, I told you that last week, you said you didn't mind.
God I know, you're right.
Ohh, it's Joshua invited me to this fancy club opening tonight. But, I already told Mr. Waltham that I would take his niece to this dumb old opera. So... What are you gonna do?
Aahh, I'm a... chef at a restaurant uptown.
Uh-huh... why... do you not like them?
Chip! Hi, it's Rachel. Rachel Green. Yeah, umm, you left me a message. Yes you did, my roommate wrote it down. Monica Geller. Ohh.
Monica, last Saturday night, what happened on Walker Texas Ranger?
Everybody? Shh, shhh. Uhhh... Central Perk is proud to present the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay.
Thank you. So how-how 'bout you, are-are you seeing anybody?
Ehhhummmm, I don't know, why don't you taste it.
No, I did, but tell me again, because it's so romantic.
What's up, Ross?
Now Joey remember, if you win you have to hug me! You hug me!
Oh God, Phoebe!
No! I mean come on! This is a huge deal! Fine I want-I need more details, who-who initiated the first kiss?
All right.
That's a good call. Right.
Well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now and we don't really know you. I mean, who is Julie? I mean, what do you like, what don't you like? We wanna hear everything.
Hello. Umm, when is your next flight to London?
Come on! You guys can pee standing up.
Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. What?
From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.
I'm sorry, what?
Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean, what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats?
No.
These are from Halloween three years ago.
Uhh.... waitressing?
Oh thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Emily?
Down at the docks again?
Hi!
Well, but Pheebs.
Oh my God!
Yes, I'm sorry. Do you have any extra pants? Umm, my friend seems to have had a little accident.
Y'know what?
Okay. Okay fine, y'know what? We will let Ross and Joey decide. Hiiiii, Ross! Sweetie.
Joey! I can't believe you just did that!
Okay.
No, so I don't have to get married until I'm 33! That's three years, that's three whole years-Oh, wait a minute though. I'll need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and I'd like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged... Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I'm thirty.
Yeah, okay, at ease solider!
Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me.
Ok, look you guys, I really don't want to get into this right now. I think it'll just make everyone uncomfortable.
She is so good at throwing drinks in people's faces, I mean I don't think I've ever seen her finish a beverage.
Honey, I'm sorry.
Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! She's coming!
No.
Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special.
Hi, Mr. Treeger. Hi, it's Rachel Green from upstairs. Yes, somebody, uh, broke our knob on the radiator and it's really hot in here. Yes, it's, it's hot enough to bake cookies. Well, do you think we could have a new one by 6? Wha t, no, no, Tuesday, we can't wait until Tuesday, we're having a party tonight.
What, as part of your poor friends outreach program?
Oh.
Wow! I can't, I can't feel my hands.
Um-hmm. There we go. There it is.
Thanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy.
Well, I-I should've told you the truth.
Yes, but I, I think about who's apartment we're gonna sleep at tomorrow night and, and where we're gonna have dinner next Saturday night. I do not think about what our childrens' names are gonna be. You know what our childrens names are gonna be.
Oh, come on! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat, you don't think that's just a little funny?!
Honey, no one thinks you're a pansy, but we do think you need a tissue.
Phoebe?! Wait a-but-but she just, she said that Joey was her backup.
Yeah?
Okay, coming!
No, wait. Wait.
Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around.
Beefsteak Charlie's?
Ethan called again.
Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
He just kept asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking.
Yeah, see ya.
This is Joey, and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross.
Really?
You see, you look beautiful. For god sakes, dim the lights.
No! Joey!
It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling... Wow! My whole mouth just filled with saliva!
Yes.
All right. All right, all right, all right, all right, I know it's stupid! I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it!
Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.
Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.
Huh. All right.
Any chance you think the couch looks good there?
No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?
Ugh!
How come we have one extra place setting?
Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just share too much?
Phoebe, I thought your dad was in prison.
Ohh, nothing, I just wanted to see you. See you and hug you. See you.
OK.
Yes! Hell yes!
Thank you. Thank you. I love you.
It's so secluded up here.
Honey, this will help.
So I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out. It's just so frustrating!
Yes.
Oh, hmm.
Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform?
Drums?
I think you should go.
Really?
Oh, wait-wait-wait...
Nooo!
...So a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street?
Huh. Does Monica know about this?
Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so...
Oh no-no-no don't say but! No-no, but's never good! Let's just leave it at, you like me and I like you.
I did.
Oh that.
That's great!
Wow! H-umm! Hi! Yes, uh I'm sorry the models are actually down the hall.
Oh, no, Michael, it's not you. I'm sorry, it's just, it's this thing. It's probably not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is, is getting a cat with his girlfriend.
No!! You are getting married! This is all I have.
Does anybody need anything?
Is he okay in there?
Well then I can't tell you what I know.
I am. Let me just get my coat.
Agghhh.
Chandler!
Hi, Pheebs? Okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your doctor is late is because uh, she's not coming.
Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?
Well now what's the rush?
Hey.
Grape.
Did, did he just, did he, did he just say, he said bye. He said bye. You said, you said bye to me. You said bye to me.
What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?
Ohh, I mean it's just so realistic!
So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night?
I know!
That is so cool.
Okay, fine. Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why I'm a terrible waitress? Because, I don't care. I don't care. I don't care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don't care where the tray spot is, I just don't care, this is not what I want to do. So I don't think I should do it anymore. I'm gonna give you my weeks notice.
Oh God, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for nine--teen blocks. Oh. Oh my God.
Hey! What's up?!
Oh, all right. But y'know I gotta say, I don't, I don't think six years counts as an era.
Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from your night?
Wh-You dated my sister!
What?
Guess what?! All that stuff about Nancy Branson being a slut was all a rumor so Chip dumped her and he wants to come over to my house tonight!
Wow! Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building before?
Ohhh!!!!
Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee.
I thought this might happen today. Ross, I know the holidays can be rough. Y'know? And it's probably really hard for you to be alone right now.
Phoebe, are you okay?
That's 'cause you have it.
Yeah, I'm good.
You're a pathetic loser, right?
Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
Well those are very popular frames.
Well...
We are looking at a Playboy.
All right, listen, smirky. If it wasn't for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this right now. But I'm not.
Joey! Kinda in the middle of a story here!
Chandler told me.
Oh, I'm sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone else?
You're gonna be late! Go! Go!
How did you make $17.
Oh, okay!
Well, I didn't know what else to do!
I know, I know, I'm sorry-
Good luck, honey!
Monica? Monica!
She's totally right! When we were together, you got all freaked out about Mark and there was nothing going on.
Hey-hey, y'know what? I don't care! I'm not ashamed of my book. There's nothing with a woman enjoying a little...erotica. It's just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand.
Hey.
Wait, but there's no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!
Oh my God.
Yeah, pretty nice, huh? Now who's a pushover?
Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them together and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name, I never realised it, Joshua! Josh-u-a! Joshua! Josh.
Yeah, it is! But you're just a kid! I mean you're 25!
Go-go-go-go, come on! So uh, what did you find out?
Yeah! I've been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat.
Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up! ...Okay, Monica, y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing.
Now I love you even more.
What did you just say?
Hi Tag! What are you doing here?
'Kay. Congratulations on your new job.
You said she was bald.
What?
Aww, Joey, come here. Look honey, I know this must be really, really difficult for you and I--Oh, I'm sorry. Am I hurting you?
Oh, god.
You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! I-I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn't feel bad!
Hi Danny! Wow! Thirsty huh?
What?!
I think they're very nice.
'Sup?
Ugh! So close!
What?!!
Yes, you did.
Right, I'll see you guys later...
Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending Thanksgiving with her.
Yeah, but, there were no suds.
Oh my God you stole her award!
Hi, I'm Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?
Okay. Hang up! That's it! Come on!
No way, forget it.
All right!
Well, apparently he scares easy.
Well, y'know what? Thanks to you I'm half way there! Ugh! Oh! I am so mad! Ross, I don't think I have ever been this angry!
So Joey I just hooked Ross and Chandler up with some tuxedos for the wedding, do you need one?
Okay, umm, I'm gonna get my sweater.
Oh, this one's for me!
Yeah.
Guess what?
Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.
Oh!
Well, y'know, sometimes that helps.
No, I know, but Ihe just went on. He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just...
Aw, honey, that's so sweet.
OK, you know what, are, are you being like, the blind date guy again?
Hi you. I can't believe I'm waking up next to you.
No Monica! I'm serious! Oh, maybe I should just forget about it. Become a lesbian or something.
Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!
Oh, it's so easy for you I mean, you're not married, you get to have sex with who ever you want!
Are any of you guys free tonight? My boss is hosting this charity event for underprivileged kids and the more people I bring, the better I look. So, Monica? Chandler?
Ohh, please! Cooking soothes me. Ahh. So, dig in!
Great!
I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry!
Oh, it's just an anti-theft device.
Hi! Oh, how was your date last night?
Are-are you saying he's a geek?
Huh. Except, Phoebe's not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.
It's a pretty cool tux.
You fell asleep?!
I'm sorry, I just can't go to the hospital lookin' like this.
Oh! Well, um.. You've got plugs!
Yeah well unless we tell him.
So how's it goin' with Joey?
And that's I'm so glad... there's no problem.
Wow!!
Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight. I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding.
No. Well, yeah, maybe.
Oh my God!! Great!
Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night.
Ahhh, I think you look great! That bag is gonna get you that part.
Then, you will definitely get him back!
Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex.
Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on.
Oh my God! Oh my God! I can't go! I'm gonna be too nervous!
Ross, that was a Halloween costume, unless you would like me to go to this thing as Little Bo Peep.
Hi!!
Okay!
Oh, that's um, interesting.
Arghhhh!!!!!!
Who's this from?
But I...
Isn't that a line from the show?!
Honey, that's you're name.
Is Monica around? I-I have to ask her something.
Oh Ross, you're so great.
I am so proud of Joey, I can't believe he's going to be on Law & Order!
What?!
It's Le Poo.
Guys! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what!
Barry?
Hi! Phoebe.
Oops, sorry. Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually, we have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.
Oh, well, you know, they're just separated so, you know, never know, we'll see.
Now wait a minute. You just took all the words!
Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.
Hi.
Uh, no she doesn't but I can, I can get a message to her.
And hey! Just so you know, it's not that common! It doesn't happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!
I'm doing just fine! God, Tiffany, you smell so great!
Oh yeah, good start Mon.
What did you just say?
Wait a minute. Chandler has a jewelry box?
Well, then, you'll just have to eat the other lamps.
Okay, y'know what? I'll-I'll have toast!
Thank you.
Please! We did not fog Danny! Who's Danny?
Okay.
Uh-hmm, uh-hmm, yeah, yeah, I really liked your hands.
Yeah, why?
That refrigerators don't live as long as people.
Well you have to because maybe it's stupid.
I got a touchdown! We did it!!
Do you want to put the book in the freezer?
The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!
Come on Joey, I just bought you a new chair! The most expensive one in the store! Hey, y'know what I was thinking? We could name her Francette.
Oh, hi!
Ha, I made you look....
I thought I was making him filet mignon?
Oh well...
I love working with designers!
Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.
It won't come off!
Um, Barry.
Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she'd still be with us-nothing about an assistant buyer?
Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here.
What?!
I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me.
Oh, making it worse!
Joey, you can't keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him.
Oh yes.
Hello?
God!
Hey, what have you guys been up to?
Was that all you wanted to ask me?
These are, these aren't for you. These are for you. Welcome to our country.
Okay.
But honey, I think she's moving in with Chandler.
Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! Every place I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. I mean, look at this; "Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." It's just, there is nothing! The city's full!
None.
Hi, remember us?
God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!
Oh, was it awful?
Oh, hi!
I know that. That's why I was getting married.
Me too!
Am I going to let you watch me undress?
Right!
Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up.
Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.
Oh! That would be sooo much fun!
Yeah?
Hi!
All right, come on, let's go get your coat.
Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago.
Hey Ross! Any word on the apartment yet?
Oh honey he doesn't need my help.
Oh, come on! I'll give you ten free Ralph Lauren shirts.
Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head.
Huh, yeah I guess we are roommates now.
Oh!
Oo, toes!! Well, for some people.
Good.
Oh God, come on you guys, is this really necessary? I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want.
Shhh...I don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented.
What is the matter with you?!
So what's going on with you?
What's your problem?
Insane!
Oh.
Hey.
We love you, we're here for you.
Okay.
No, we never do that
It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.
Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed.
None for me.
Phoebe we just saw mine, let me see yours.
Ross, get over it! It's not like she hates you.
No, I think it's very obvious who's wrong here.
Why, why not?
Okay. Okay.
Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you're, you're, you're making this too hard.
Hello? Yeah, this is she. Oh! You're kidding! You're kidding! Oh thank you! I love you!
Yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means Joey.
Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!
Oh, how does he look? How does he look?
Well, I didn't see Joshua last night, but I did punch a girl in the face.
Yeah! I got my girls.
Yeah?
Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this?
Oh, I'm sorry I spoiled you're evening.
Why?!
You're right! I mean you're right! It wasn't just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in.
Okay, wait a minute. Wait a minute, I-I-I, I can't do this. Listen honey, this is, it's not Phoebe's fault. She lent me the earrings, and I lost it. I'm so sorry. Honey, I feel terrible too.
Hi, I thought you might like some ice chips.
I cannot believe you.
Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?
So you know how to fix it?
Honey, I'm just checking.
Oh well, no I...
Y'know you're-you're probably wondering about the old date on there.
But I saved it. I put my basket on top.
You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do.
Yes.
For Ross, Ross, Ross.
Yeah.
Yeah?
I can not believe your trading me!!
Hey Jess.
Oh.
...we went back the house and we got really silly and we...we made out.
Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.
Good luck.
All right, y'know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat?
Bye you guys!
Terry is a jerk, ok? That's why we're always saying "Terry's a jerk!" That's where that came from.
You don't know?!
Oh no.
No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.
Yeah.
Oh, hey!
Um-hmm.
Aghh.
Ross, can you pass me the yams?
O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.
Come on apartment! Come on apartment! Oh! I know queen is high!
I mean y'know, I'm thinking. You could bring her, and you guys could go up to your old room, and not make out.
Okay. Ah, well we'll just see about that, okay. I will read The Shining, and you will read Little Women.
No! No! Phoebe, come on! I don't want to switch! Please come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!
No, no Phoebe no, I was...no. You know what, I was, I was actually just checking to, see, if I could run. And I can!
Yeah... ....OK. Where were we? Oh, OK... five card draw, uh... jacks or better... nothing wild, everybody ante.
All right, I'm gonna make more margaritas!
Oh! Oh my God! What did I just do?
Look, y'know I know my life's going pretty well, but I look around and I just see so many people who've accomplished so many other goals by the time they're thirty.
Oh god. I think I'm gonna be sick.
And you're still not attracted to him at all?
Yeah honey, I'm standing right there! Why didn't you just tell him about the mole I haven't got checked yet.
I don't know, you tell me. One minute I'm holding Ben like a football, the next thing I know, I've got two kids, I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about the taxes.
Ok, well, not a problem. We'll just use them to stop the bleeding. Ok. Baggage claim? Ok.
Okay.
Joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can't return it.
Wel-wel-well what are we gonna do?
It's a truffle. It's got all of these layers. First there's a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch, then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sauteed with peas and onions, then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!
So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by the time we're 40, we get married. I mean, we know each other, we like each other, and we've-we've already slept together so y'know there'll be no surprises there! You know what I mean? No like, "What's that?!"
Well, that doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas.
Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.
Oh please...
Yeah?
Oh honey, I'll say good-bye to you at the car if you don't mind the puss.
No-n-n-n-no! I am finally thinking clearly. My lucky dress wasn't working out to well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed.
Oh, y'know, would you just for once, not remember every...little...thing!!
Look-look-look-look-look, my first pay check! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me!
Yeah. I'm sorry.
It's kinda slutty.
Okay no, you do it.
What you got there? Something else that's not yours that you can break?
Don't!! Honey, what are you doing here?!
Okay, I need a date!
Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now! Oh, thank you!
Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.
All right!! Fine! Fine.
Noo! Angels.
Well, actually Gunther sent me. You're not allowed to have cups out here, it's a thing.
Don't you have a laundry room in your building?
Waitressing?
No, you know what, I think you should go.
Ugh, that was so embarrassing! I can't believe you let me go on and on like that!
Still in love with?!
I wasn't supposed to put beef in the trifle!
Ugh! What grandmother?
Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in lost and found.
Hi Daddy.
I can't! It's too late! Terry already hired that girl over there. Look at her, she's even got waitress experience. Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin.... swans.
Oh! Pathetic!
Well, here's another question for ya. Uhh, do you know what that silver knob on the toilet does?
Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried...
All right? Thank you.
Yeah, I don't think so Joe.
Yeah!
Is he here?
Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!!
Oh, come on, would you just grab my ass.
So are things with you and Joey any better?
Okay great, hold on a sec! Oh, here you go! You don't mind do ya? That would really help me out a lot! Thanks!
Ross, I am a human doodle!!
Yeah, whoosh!
Yeah, when we're in the audience he doesn't talk to us, but he does wave.
Not at all inappropriate!
Oh, I would love to!
Hey.
Hi.
Okay, you're right. You're right. You can't help me.
We?!
What was that?!
Ooh, okay... good.
Big night!
Me?!
What are you saying?
Excuse me! But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat!
...And so then I realised. All this stuff I had been doing. proposing to Joshua, lying to Ross about why I couldn't come to the wedding. Was all just a way of...
No! Help me!
Oh, no, no no. I meant that he's gonna be paying that other woman beause she's a professional.
I have so got it. There's gonna be rumours about this, there's no way to stop it. Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know.
Ohh. Ooh!
Hello? Um, yeah, uh, Okay ah, hold on a second, lemme lemme just check and see if see if she's here.
All right, let's do it.
I know, I know. I went a little crazy.
Hi sweetie!
Yeah.
No. Have you?
Ohhhh, come on!!!
No, actually first they started on my waist. And then, they slid up, and then, they were in my hair.
Okay you're right. I'll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect for the job Hilda!
All right.
Oh, no problem. I'm so glad I could help. Happy for you.
C'mon up.
Yeah!
Absolutely.
Oh that's great!
I'm gonna need a copy of those.
I know, I know, but uh just, I'm telling you, once, once you get past that part, that where it-it just feels like you wanna die, he's-he's really a good person.
Daddy.
Oh look! A letter from my mom.
You?
I know.
Oh, honey, that's so sweet.
You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don't tell the guy that!
Oh thank you. Hey y'know, I'm so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth.
Okay, here we go...
Ooh, your brother. Score!
: Really? : Sure, we have scones left! : OK, read them to me.
Ross, Ross, please listen to me. Ross, you are so much better for me than Paolo ever was. I mean you care about me, you're loving, you make me laugh.
Really?!
How about you guys?
I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me.
All right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating Bob!
Well, yeah! We're cool. Totally cool.
The beef? Yeah, that was weird to me, too. But then, y'know, I thought "well, there's mincemeat pie," I mean that's an English dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, y'know. Oh! by the way, can I borrow some Rum from your place?
You ah, you didn't say 'Yes' to that did you?
Monica look! Look-look-look! Here is that table that I ordered.
I'm gonna marry someone good y'know.
Look, If I don't get to London!! He is going to marry that other girl!!!
Oh.
My boss, Joanna? Wow, that must've been awkward.
Three people. Joshua's not gonna be there.
I have the best job in the entire world! The most adorable guy came over today, and I got to dress him up all day!
Y'know, I'm still 29 in Guam.
Well y'know, we did other stuff too.
Oh! Thank you!
Noo.
Huh.
