Do you even know what a vicar is?
It happened! I am telling you it happened!
Op, op, car! Car!! Ugh!!!
No! If there was I wouldn't tell you.
Monica look! Look-look-look! Here is that table that I ordered.
No. Have you?
Ugh. Wait, wait, wait.
Oh!
It's so secluded up here.
Yes. Here you go Officer uh, Handsome.
Oh, come on now, don't keep me waiting. Get those clothes off! But, I would keep that helmet on because you're in for a rough ride!
Remember when we were in high school together?
I don't think so.
Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!
Ross! Phoebe's gonna be here any second, she cannot see this!
Yeah!
Got a job on a river boat?
All right, so we weren't prepared!
Well, maybe you didn't want it to end?
Ross! Come on! That's all right! Fine--Okay, I have a weird thing about my eye. Can we not talk about it please?
You just did a little dancy thing.
Hi you guys!
Hey, Pheebs, quick question for ya.
Yeah do it now, call right now.
Hi!
OK, listen, I'm sorry about last night and I really want to make it up to you.
Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?
Uh-huh.
Sorry. I'm sorry.
Hey!
Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.
Monica, betting the apartment, I don't know about this.
OK, so that's... that's what, two bottles? And yet somehow we went through five?
Joey, what are you doing with the bag? You're audition is not until tomorrow.
Good.
Oh honey, come on, I'm sorry, I didn't.... I don't mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.
Was that all you wanted to ask me?
Yeah, I'm with Mon.
Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know? Y'know what I mean, like dubbies? And I actually, I thought to myself, "Wow, those guys are crazy!" But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.
Uh-huh, yeah I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with you.
Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.
I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before.
Ross thanks.
Would anybody like more coffee?
All right, I'm outta here!
I, I don't have it.
Oh.
Ross's what?
Phoebe, how would you do this to me? This was all your idea.
Guess what. Ben just said his first word.
Its back in cage!
I am so hot for you right now.
Fine! We'll ask Phoebe.
Come on Ross give me the keys! Monica does not know what she's talking about! I am an excellent driver!
Well there's an idea!!
He even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it.
I don't know, I don't know.
Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually , but now she's actually stealing you.
Oh my ... you think I'm a pushover. Well wait, watch this, you know what? You're not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I think that's pretty strong, that's what I think. Come on, Monica, let's go to lunch.
Well you better.
Well, that doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas.
Do we have to tell her?
Ohh, hi, Kim.
Ross, no! There is no way I am leaving this room looking like this!
Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
Oh, honey! Don't get up! What do you need?
What, it's ok when Chandler does it?
Summer catalogue!
Anyway, um, I guess this belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me.
Oh! That would be sooo much fun!
No, he said we were holding up the people behind us.
What handsome is not your type? Smart? Kind? Good kisser? What those things aren't on your list? Ross is a great guy! You would be lucky to be with him!
Oh b-b-but it is!
Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?
I'd wait.
Okaaay. Any of you guys want anything else?
I don't know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer, y'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just don't want to be 30 and still work here.
So, is this just gonna be you and Carol?
Oh, Joey, look who it is.
It'll never last, he's just a rebound roommate.
No! No! No! No it's not! No it's not! Come on! Phoebe, ours is totally different! I mean we don't have the... We don't have the...that lamp! And-and that screen is y'know, on the other side.
Okay look, let me paint you a little picture. All right, you are settin' sail up the Hudson! You've got the wind in your h--arms! You-you get all that peace and quiet that you've always wanted! You get back to nature! You can go fishin'! You can-ooh, you can get one of those little hats and have people call you captain, and then when you're old, Cappy.
You were with Julie?
Okay.
Oh, I don't know, I guess, Chris O'Donnel, John F. Kennedy, Jr., Daniel Day Lewis, Sting, and Parker Stevenson.
Ohh!!
Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Y'know, it's-it's just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don't get to keep the gifts.
Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I don't like guys with boring jobs.
No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don't need that today.
Goodnight.
Phoebe, what are you doing?
...pig...pig man!
No.
Well, y'know I was thinking of moving the couch over here.
Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, the caterers, the music...
Thank you.
Hi.
Ok, ok, ok, moving on, moving on, next question. Ok number 29, have you ever betrayed another goddess for a lightning bearer? Ok, number 30.
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a girl?
God, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.
Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?
Oh my God, Phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?!
Thank you. Oh, cool! Free sample of coffee!
Oh, I forgot this was in here. Umm, this was the uh garter that I was saving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monica's something borrowed and it's blue. Yeah...
So I'm thinking about you. So what?
Oh my gosh, wow. Monica. Oh my god. Mom. This is so great.
What? Why?!
Time is money my friend?
Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?
You're bachelor pad?!
Okay.
I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming up- I wanted him to meet my family-
How is you drinking helping the kids?
Hey, do you believe this? Do you believe they are actually getting married?
Okay. What the hell was that? You know what? Don't answer me. I have a date with Danny.
Ross said my name. Okay? My name. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me! Okay, don't believe me, I know I'm right-do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?
Phoebe, no! This is, this is insane.
Noo, that's our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor.
I almost caught that one!
No, we kinda broke up instead.
Ross, you don't know that.
Yes oh--Do I want sugar in my coffee? No, just some milk would be good Carol. Thanks. Okay, do you remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?
Oh yeah, what's it about?
Hi you!
Oh, by the way Mon, I don't think the mailman liked your cookies. Here are the ornaments your mom sent.
Yes it is.
Ooh, this is soo sweet, Joey our little twinkle-toes.
What?!
Honey, you got a little thing on your...
Ohh, OK, OK, OK, well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.
Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.
All right, I like that.
Why are- why are you so tanned?
Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.
Oh, The Velveteen Rabbit! Oh my God, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real!
Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.
All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler.
Yeah! You-you got the job! You're my new assistant!
Really? Mine too.
I had one glass.
Okay, okay, okay.
Yeah! Guess who walks into my office is the end of my story. It was Ralph Lauren! Ralph Lauren walked into my office!
That's your, that's your dad's bedroom. That's your dad's bedroom!
Well, she told me. She said she's kinda a loner.
I have.
Ooh, Pheebs, what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are?
Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.
Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!
Yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means Joey.
What happened?
I went really long.
Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some Jell-O with them.
Yeah, right, he almost danced me right down that...garbage chute.
Okay..
Thank you. Thank you. I love you.
All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.
Oh, honey, please, no, I can't get started with all that Ross stuff again. I mean, he's gonna screwed up for a looong time. And besides y'know, I don't, I don't go for guys right after they get divorced.
I can't let him go out that way, he's got a meeting. You've got something here on your back.
Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.
Oh no.
See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened? He got phased out!
What?!
Oh. Oh my God, is that Phoebe?
Nothing.
Uh, yeah, well, see, he... Joey knows, that I'm-I'm very insecure about my back and, and...you're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it, yeah!
Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have got to tell you something!
Oh, yeah, sure, sure, sure, sure. Listen, can we please have lunch the next time I'm in the city?
Phoebe, his music could not get any worse. There are rats in the basement that are hanging themselves.
Yeah, we're gonna... we're gonna get some cake.
Ask me what?
Hello?
Phoebe's dead.
Rachel...
Well, y'know what? Actually, I was about to bid on this lovely trip to Paris.
Oh, I beg to differ. The Pictionary incident?
Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help.
Okay, listen, I'm thinking, why don't we just tell them who we really are? I mean, it'll be fine, I really think it'll be fine.
Yeah, that didn't work.
Wait, what am I gonna do?
Oh, did you beat him at a board game? He turns into such a baby when he starts to lose.
Well, they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is 'no tissue, no tuschy.' Well, if everybody's going.
I know, I know, but uh just, I'm telling you, once, once you get past that part, that where it-it just feels like you wanna die, he's-he's really a good person.
Umm...
Probably just the first half.
Yes, I'll meet 'em.
...see I can't decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair, the Sahara desk, or the Parker console table.
Goodbye, baby.
Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.
Pheebs, I wanna ask you something.
So all we have is ice?
Oh, you are losing. Definitely losing.
Well then I can't tell you what I know.
Oh no!
Yeah but, I've never asked a guy out before.
Why the voice.
Just get out! Now!!
Monica, I'm quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn't even buy it! I'm telling you I'm quitting! That's it! I'm talking to my boss right now! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you get this message. Oh! Mr. Waltham, I ah really need to talk to you.
You love her.
Hey! Hey, Pheebs, check it out. Yeah, for my desert, I have chosen to make a traditional English truffle!
When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rock bottom. But today, it's like there's rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, then me.
Fine!
That's right, he can have his job back. I'm glad we got that all straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back.
How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!
Hey!
Oh, you got me.
With Ross and Jill?
No. Why?
Oh, that must be it.
What?
Gimme an 'M!'
Grape.
Ok, look you guys, I really don't want to get into this right now. I think it'll just make everyone uncomfortable.
Yes, you did.
Oh Ross you're so tense! You just gotta relax okay? Just need to relax all right? Just need to relax...
Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience!
What?!
Are you drunk?!
Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks.
Oh. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. Sorry. It's just, I'm ahh, I'm kinda excited. I'm, ahh, going to London to ahh, tell this guy that I love him and...
Op, I like credit cards!
Joey, just ignore the boats all right? We're not finished with the lesson yet.
Ohh! Me too!
Honey, you're not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives.
Hi!
So did you break up with Joanna?
Okay. Hey, what are you thinking? What are you thinking right now?
Oh no, you're the best.
Oh, okay, we're going. Yeah.
DANGER!!!!!
Oh... Italy, I think.
Um, Pheebs, so, you guys just dont get along?
Really?! How do you know?
Well, here's another question for ya. Uhh, do you know what that silver knob on the toilet does?
That was surreal. Okay, what do think? Are you interested at all?
When you were in China.
The beef? Yeah, that was weird to me, too. But then, y'know, I thought "well, there's mincemeat pie," I mean that's an English dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, y'know. Oh! by the way, can I borrow some Rum from your place?
All right! Ross, do you think it's easy for me to see you with somebody else?
Get the hell out of there, y'know?
Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad.
Yeah.
You remember when we got these?
Come on you guys! What are doing?! I thought we were the patch sisters!
Hey! Hey, you guys, I finished the crossword all by myself! Hug me!
Is he romantic with her?
Why?
No! I'm so happy for them!
Oooh.
I don't know!
My God! What happened to you?
I wasn't supposed to put beef in the trifle!
By all means.
Yeah.
It's okay! It's okay! It kicked once, it'll kick again!
Thank you.
Um... my... father.
Yeah?
No!! You are getting married! This is all I have.
Well, you're not sixteen, you're both adults now.
So what?! Y'know what? The way I see it--Ow! Son of a bitch!!
Oh really? Like what Monica?
Well, why doesn't he practice with a girl?
That's right Joey, the chair angel came in and heeled your chair.
Oh my God, Le Poo, our dog!
What was the book?
Oh, somebody will.
Here you go. Thank you!
Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding!
Ooo! Oh, I forgot they made sheets!
Ross said my name up there, I mean, come on, I just can't pretend that didn't happen can I?
So Pheebs, pick one of them.
None for me.
Oh, hi.
Ooh, I just feel bad, I never vacuum.
No!
Oh, okay, well, I think we should let Phoebe decide, because she's the only who's impartial, and she's so pretty.
NO but Ross. We are never gonna happen, OK. Accept that.
Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't wanna...
I'm just kidding too. I'm getting married in December.
Come on, please?! I'm boredddd! You let me do it once before.
Well, I feel fine, but I think you're bumming out the rest of the kids.
All right, that's it, you guys! What happened out there?
I might know something too.
Well, Valentine's Day was like two weeks ago, so I wouldn't get her a calendar!
Oh.
Well maybe, maybe she's with us right now?
Well, he didn't say, but it was a fire. I'm guessing not very good. Come on, we gotta go!
Um, everyone?
Please! We did not fog Danny! Who's Danny?
Okay then!
But, Pheebs, you can still use the copy machine where I actually work. But, just come by at lunch so my boss doesn't see you. Cause Kim will just freak out and she already doesn't like me very much.
Ok, who ordered what?
I know. Yeah, see, there's so much to do and I have so little time to do it in.
Ross? Look, whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants, just give it to her. Come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. So just fix whatever she wants fixed. Just do it. I mean, you're gonna have to try. You'll just gonna hate yourself if you don't. Oh come on answer it! It's driving me crazy!
No. A break from us.
You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!
I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.
Sure Pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies and pretend agents.
Yeah.
Well, of course I am! It's not gonna happen to Ross! He's your brother. He's your old college roommate. Ugh, it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go.
Excuse me, there was no time!
Oh, great.
We?!
And you're no friend to those with noses.
What's your favourite thing about summertime?
What did, what did he say?
Yeah.
Oh, that's true.
This one?
Oh? Yeah! Sure!
No-n-n-n-no! I am finally thinking clearly. My lucky dress wasn't working out to well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed.
Phoebe is gonna be Monica's maid of honor!
Oh, I probably shouldn't-so I will! Oh! Wow! It's like it's raining!
There. Now there is.
Yeah. Ahh, here's a box of your stuff.
Oh god. I think I'm gonna be sick.
Oh! Thank God!
Okay. Okay. I think we can do this if we just get organized. All right? We have two days to plan this party. We just need to make fast decisions! Okay? All right, where are we gonna have it?
Okay, now that is the third time someone has said something like that to me today.
Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.
Well, I did my best to convince him that I'm not some crazy girl who is dying to get married-I'm just going through a hard time.
Hey.
Hello.
And you were at this job for four years?
Hey!
Ugh, Monica I don't want to steal your stupid thunder!
What's 1922?
Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right, no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you really want to get back into that?
No. A break from us.
Funny book?
Well, I met Danny's sister yesterday, and uh that was actually the girl on the subway.
Oh come on, I already went.
Yeah, you're on your own.
What?!!
This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this?
No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?
It was nice to meet you.
Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?
The lights, please..
Well, at least that's a great suit.
No.
Honey, you have nothing to prove. And if you really like this girl, I don't flirting is the right thing to...
The whole night was horrible, it was pouring down rain, and when I got there, there was no Rachel Green on the list, but there was a Rachel Greep.
No...oh, I feel so stupid! Oh, I think about the other day with you guys and I was all "Oh, Paolo, he's so great, he makes me feel so..." Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed!
Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, it'll still be broken then.
Yes! Rent!
Uhh, let's just stay clear of 'I'm the guy that's doing you daughter' and you should be ok.
That's right!
Okay.
Yeah! No that's what I was thinking.
Pheebs, Monica tripped me, I don't think I can ever run again, ever!
Mon?
He got it a flea market!
You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him. Yeah! Like if I would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. Or uh, or my underwear.
Okay, Pheebs, can I ask? So, hes going out with her. I mean, is it really so terrible?
Gunther, Gunther, please, I've worked here for two and a half years, I know the empty trays go over there.
He's perfect, he's never been better.
It's a, it's a cat!
Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in lost and found.
What are you talking about Pheebs? I don't... Oh my God, you drew on me?!
Ooooh! Honey, well we'll find you something. Do you wanna wear my black jacket?
Right. Was it the, "Please don't show me another picture of a trilobite vibe?"
Oh, it's okay.
Hey-hey, y'know what? I don't care! I'm not ashamed of my book. There's nothing with a woman enjoying a little...erotica. It's just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand.
No, I know, but Ihe just went on. He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just...
Okay. Switch places with me! Switch places with me! Come on! I'll go under, you go over!
Oh honey, thank you, but Mark's taking me out.
Y'know I can't believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!
Paul. Umm, I just wanted you to know that Ross really is a great guy.
What?
All right look lady here is the deal, I came here for an annulment and I am not leaving here until I get one!
Hi.
Yeah.
Yeah. No. And you know what? Nobody even saw!
OOooooo!
Yeah.
Jill?
Hey. I've got something that's gonna make you happy. Guess what Gunther found?
You know what?
Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank God Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy and wouldn't shut up.
Uh-huh.
Wow, y'know if Joey and Chandler walked in right now, we could make a fortune!
Hey!
Oh come on, what are you talking about? You've got three years painting houses. Two whole summers at T.G.I. Friday's, come on!
OK.
And-and what else?
Ohhhh!
There you go!
Mon you definitely have to make it a theme wedding, and the theme could be, "Look how much money we've got!" Y'know, I mean you could put, you could put money in-in the invitations! You-you could have like little money place settings. And ah, you could start with a money salad! I mean it'll be dry, but people will like it.
Yeah, pretty nice, huh? Now who's a pushover?
Right...
Hey, how's...how's the uh, miracle chair?
When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move?
No, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella, so I clocked her. Ohhh! I can't believe this, all I wanted was a few hours outside of work to see Joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me.
Well, so, why don't you just turn it off?
Could tonight be the Night?
Tag? Hi, who was that?
Oh.
Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!!
I don't!
Aw honey stop! It's not that bad.
Great!
Shhhh!
She you in the parking lot.
Wel-wel-well what are we gonna do?
Well umm, maybe we could uhh... Ah-ha! Too slow!!
What?! I didn't have a good time in Greece! Ross abandoned me! Okay, I couldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up to me all the time going, "Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying?" I mean, it was sooo humiliating. I felt like such an idiot! I mean, it's all my fault! And you know why, because I make very bad decisions.
Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and ohh God this is funny, look, this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride. And look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because I was Wonder Woman. Oh and here's a little purse that I found. Y'know I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there.
Yeah, well, it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has uh Dr. Franzblau been by?
Yeah!
Absolutely not.
Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.
Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back!
Umm, okay, I think I'm-I'm just gonna-just gonna say it. Just gonna say it. Uhh, I'm still in love with you Ross.
Hi! Oh, I'm so glad you called.
Really?
No, listen to me. I fell for you and I get clobbered. You then fall for me and I again, somehow, get clobbered. I'm tired of being clobbered, ya know, it's, it's just not worth it.
Hi!
So?
What, no, no, no, mine are deceptively small I mean, I-I-I actually sometimes, st-stuff my bra.
Nobody.
Yeah?
Oh no! No! It's actually-it's very sweet. It's very sweet. Look! Yeah, do you want it?
Let me, let me get you some wine!
What?
Wow! Look at that, Chip Matthews called. I wonder what he wants?
You still think of it as your apartment, don't you?
Oh my God.
Hello.
Yeah, what, so? You had feelings for me first.
Hey, Ross!!! I told you I don't!
Hi!!
No, I'm just....
Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks? Spoiled?
And did you notice...?
Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him.
Well, we're a little early, the lecture doesn't end for 15 minutes.
Okay.
Oh well, no I...
Yeah, I'm good.
All right, would-would you mind just not going out with him again? Okay, just the idea of you and he and all these women, it's just-And I know he's my assistant and I can't date him-but it just bothers me, all right?!
Oh, yeah go ahead.
Oh, thank God.
Well, how did you find out?
Alimony.
Thank you, Okay, Okay.
Rachel.
Water it is.
Pretty much.
With my sister Jill and my ex-boyfriend Ross?
Yeah, yeah, you go talk to your friend. You tell him, "Nice try."
Ohh.
Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.
Yeah, I know. It's ridiculous! I can't see you either.
Hey, Mon.
I swear, I never wanted any part of your night!
Really?
Wow! Tell me something Joey--Whoa! I just fell right off the couch there.
Gimme a 'Y!'
Well, there you go!
Hi! Phoebe.
Ok?
What? Oh, I'm sorry, I can't, I'm busy.
Yes! That I know, this is from White Plains.
Well y'know, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh, we'd jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so they'd put salt on their cereal.
That's great! Wow man, so Joey must've really taught you some stuff huh?
No! No! Phoebe, come on! I don't want to switch! Please come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!
And heels.
Say it!
Oh, me too.
Thank you.
Chandler!
Where the hell've you been?
Whoa! Hey-hey, you planning on inviting us?
Good! I'm glad it's not a problem.
You're not an artist.
You remember not having sex in high school, right?
Yes!
But honey he calls everybody by a nickname! Okay, look, I know, all right, just one dinner, please, just one night for me, please. I just want him to love you like I do. All right, well not exactly like I do, but, but, if you do come to dinner, I'll love you like I do in that black thing that you like.
Oh, come on Ross! I think it would be really good for you!
Hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?
Me too!
Well, you've been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation. But y'know, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate.
Tails!
So?
Monica, I'm your best friend.
She is so good at throwing drinks in people's faces, I mean I don't think I've ever seen her finish a beverage.
Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's? Oh! Ok, ok, ok, I just really, uh, I just really need to not be with you right now.
Hey, what have you guys been up to?
Oh, god.
God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what- Chandler, look at that.
Whoa what?
Hi!
Phoebe, we can't, we just can't just let it happen! Okay, we have to do something! We have to break them up! Okay? Just go in there and like, shave her head! You owe me one bald girl!!
Listen honey, can you keep dad occupied, I'm gonna go talk to mom for a while.
Anyway, Ralph just came in to tell me that he's so happy with my work that he wants me to be the new merchandising manager for polo retail.
Y'know who doesn't even like dirty movies? My new boyfriend Joshua.
Hey.
Yeah uh, y'know what uh, let's skip it.
No, actually I took it off then I drew it back on.
Oh, okay see I thought, I thought you meant how much was it when it was new, y'know like back then.
I know!
OK, gook luck.
Terrible? Hell, I was in Greece! That was a nice hotel! Nice beach, met the nice people. Not to shabby for Rachel.
All right, you know what? I am not leaving here, until you call that plane back!!
Who?
Hi!
Joey!
Joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can't return it.
Thank you! Hey, how'd the catering go?
Oh, yeah, I had too. There was never any parking by the Psychology building.
Oh, no no no no no.
Oh, and then, we got into this big, stupid fight. I just, it was awful. I told him he treats me like a park ranger, or something, oh and then I told him I wanted to take a break, I don't want to take a break.
Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!
Ross! Your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago! And could you strike "Consummated like bunnies" from the record?
Wow! Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building before?
What-what, wait a minute, you don't think that's why he wants me back?
Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here...
Hey!
Oh. Well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that.
What's that?
Wow! This is so amazing! What else? What else?
Huh. All right.
Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you're, you're, you're making this too hard.
You're jokin' right?
I mean I'm probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I mean what's 2%? That's nothing.
Well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now and we don't really know you. I mean, who is Julie? I mean, what do you like, what don't you like? We wanna hear everything.
OK, OK, it's my turn.
You shouldn't.
Ooh great! Very Monica.
leave...
Well, like anything can be sexy. Like umm, oh-oh, like this dishtowel! Ooh, ooh, this feels sooo good against my cheek! And-and if I feel a little hot, I can just dab myself with it. Or I can bring it down to my side and bring it through my fingers while I talk to him.
Hmm. Kinda stepped on my point there, Mon.
Why? Why not?! People love to hear that!
Well, it's about time.
Hey.
Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I was going to keep the uh, the cute guy's cell phone?
Whoa! What?! Why?!
Monica, will-will you marry me?
Well, I-I guess-I...
Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I'm doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I'm doing something that I'm actually good at. I mean. if you don't get that...
Oh! Well, as a single woman, who is available, I think you look great!
Hi!
No, I have all of the good words. OK, fine, fine, we can switch.
Yeah, I got that.
All right, we were shaking hands and he kinda leaned toward me... Y'know maybe he was going to open the door, but I totally miss read him and I uhhh...
Okay.
Okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for Joey.
Oh don't even ask!
Yeah?
God, he's good.
Yeah and there's really cute guys there.
Hello? Uh, Rachel. Great, someone is in our apartment. Call the cops!
Are they in love?
No-no-no! This chair's not going anywhere.
Hey Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
What did you just say?
But I thought that ring stood for Caprice's undying love for her brother.
Oh yes! Thank you!
Wh, Ross what do you want from me? You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?
So are things with you and Joey any better?
Uh-huh! Nice try, but you don't get that chair anymore! All right? That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap! No I take that back!
No, you wait! This is ridiculous!
Uh-huh.
Hi!
Ohh Tag, umm...you're such a great guy and we have sooo much fun together but I don't-I don't...
I wrote you a letter.
Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants?
Well, so what're you gonna do?
All right, y'know what? If you don't want to believe me about this, why don't you just come with me to dinner tonight and she will tell you.
Well, yes, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names I think.
What?!
Right?
Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there!
Y'know what? I think we can just leave it at that. It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...
No honey, okay, okay, you wanna know why Ross canceled the date? Because I asked him to.
Oh. Oh my God.
Wow.
I think he's across the hall.
So you'll definitely get onstage, even if you don't win.
Yeah, I know.
Oh, I'm sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone else?
My God!
Yeah, and none of these stupid grocery questions, real personal questions.
What are you talking about? I love them! Yeah, I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it. And then, then my cat died. But Joey, isn't this cool?
It depends on who asked.
Oh, are you sure you're ok?
Eh! Stop it!
Then what's with all the bananas?
Yeah.
Oh my God. Did you talk to him?
Okay!
What? What is so strange about me having a date?
Yeah you like totally let him wash his feet in the pool of your inner power.
Well what?! How-how much is it?!
Hi Tag! What are you doing here?
What?
Would you guys stop.
Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in the shower?
Maybe that's all we do, what about Julie?
Hey. Got a second?
Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here.
It's a different guy!
What?! No! Why?!
Don't!! Honey, what are you doing here?!
Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor.
What?!
Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing.
Okay.
Yeah.
I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?
Hm-mm.
Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me! Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced tea. I'm getting pretty good at this!
Ohh, it's Joshua invited me to this fancy club opening tonight. But, I already told Mr. Waltham that I would take his niece to this dumb old opera. So... What are you gonna do?
All right.
Well that works out good, because I'm not listening.
Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!
Ohh, I like swimmer's bodies!
Pick one.
Ahh, yes, I will have a glass of the Merlot
Pheebs, I was wondering...
We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.
Hey.
Aww Pheebs, that sucks!
Beef.
Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?
Oh God, absolutely.
Ohh that's great!
Yeah, and also we need more umm, drinks. Hold on a second. Whup, okay. Hello! Vegas? Yeah, we would like some more alcohol, and y'know what else? We would like some more beers. Hello? Ohh, I forgot to dial!
I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.
No! So I can be by myself. Y'know? Have a little alone time.
Ok, Well, what about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?
Yes!!
Well y'know, it's you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff! Y'know? I mean, you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! I guess I'm not upset because I don't see you guys going through with it. I'm sorry.
So it would just be, me alone?
Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. What?
Ohh, well you got 'em.
I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phone...
Hi Joey! What are you doing here?
Okay. What?! What are you doing here?!
Oh..Go..Oh..and I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren. If she finds out that I lied to her, she is going to hate me even more. Phoebe!!
Oh wow.
Show cat! Quality show cat! Show cat!
Hi! You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you.
Uh-huh.
These are, these aren't for you. These are for you. Welcome to our country.
You are right there with Emily. And it's y'know, it's kinda like.... it's a tie! Well, I gotta get, I gotta get back to the dishes.
Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?
Okay, I heard that.
You have a roommate?!
Hey, Monica!
Come on.
Yeah, whoosh!
Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.
Umm, honey, look he just came over to....
Honey.
Okay.
That's a good story, Grandpa.
'Kay. Congratulations on your new job.
Sit down!
Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan.
I'm sorry, that's not funny.
I can not believe he would do that to Mon-Whoa! Joey, do they know that we know?
"Ooo," what?
Okay.
Okay!
I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too late.
Ugh, tramp!
Ugh, it was horrible! And-and the interview part went so well, y'know? I even made him laugh. He said something about a boat and I was like, "Well, yeah! If you've got enough life jackets!" Trust me, it was actually, it was very funny. Anyway, so we were saying good-bye and ugh!
I will not! I'm the divisional head of men's sportswear!
Seriously, your dad doesn't like pranks.
In a month?
Mm-mmm.
That's great!
How many guesses do you get?
Well, actually, I meant for me. The hiring committee is meeting people all day and...
I didn't know that.
Okay. Okay, great! Umm, okay, just turn around.
You and your stupid fear. I hate your fear. I would like to take you and your fear....
Yeah, maybe...
Yes, okay, oh, by the way, I just gotta say, I think it's really nice of you that even after you've moved, you still keep storing that stuff for Joey!
Who gave you that hickey?
Okay. I'm sorry. You're right, you're right.
Well, maybe-maybe I could be your roommate Pheebs.
Yeah! Wait a minute, it's been a long time that I've been single. How come you never offered this before?
Oh... ... Oh my God. He remembered.
Well of course that is what I'm here for!
What.
Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?
Oh!
Joey I don't think you know what behalf means.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Okay. Walked right into that one didn't he?
So, how was your date?
All right, let's do it.
Oh.
Oh my God! Oh my God!!
Okay, whoa-whoa easy there Melissa! This ain't a locker room, okay? But, y'know I remember him saying that-that he had plans tonight.
Oh!! My God, what are you doing here?
I do.
No, you could've lost your job.
Thanks, you can just put it on the table.
I don't know! He hasn't called me since that one time when we went out. I see him in the hallway, we flirt, I'm all ha-ha-ha-ha, and nothing.
OK.
Oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on you're gonna ruin it!
Whoa! I can't believe you did that. That was really sweet.
Did he call? Did Mark call?
Hello, Mrs. Chatracus.
Yeah, it is! But you're just a kid! I mean you're 25!
I can't believe it! I got a second interview!
Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.
Oh-okay, but Pheebs?
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job-
Okay, okay, okay, I got one! Anyway- The valentine Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me.
Y'know what? I am going to do something today. I'm not just gonna sit around like some old lady. I'm gonna get something pierced. Like my uh, like my nose or my tongue or something.
Oh, Phoebe, that really cute guy is here again.
You guys are really right...there aren't you?
Monica! Come on!
It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!
Y'know what else is really great about him, oh, what is the word for the adult that doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom?
Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?
What?!
Oh, please tell me it's not because I'm going with Mark.
Hey!
Oooooh. : Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview!
Oo, toes!! Well, for some people.
I don't know. What do you mean last night? Nothing, nothing uh, happened last night.
Why? Honey, what is the big deal?
Umm.
See?
What?
Yes!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!
Oh, really, let me see, let me see.
Cats, how long do they live figuring you don't... y'know, throw 'em under a bus or something?
Why would I have to sleep with you?
Yeah.
What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!
Yeah, what?
Well, I do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat.
Marcel?
Ah, first, I-I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again.
Wh-what do you mean?
Chandler told me.
Huh. Well, y'know that's actually a really good idea, because that way they'll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too.
Okay honey, you can finish this later we're gonna be late. We gotta go.
So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night?
Yeah.
You are ready to make a commitment!
"I'm Monica, I don't get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!"
And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!
Her dancer friends?
Well, I thought you liked doing it.
I'm so sorry.
Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily.
Close call day.
Who's this from?
I'm not moving! Is that picture straight?
No seriously, y'know the contracts I gave you, did you overnight them?
Yeah, it's just y'know...
And a crappy New Year.
No, it's all right. I got nice boobs.
Nothing.
Well, I, umm...
...we went back the house and we got really silly and we...we made out.
I-I-I didn't! I didn't! She thought you were cute.
Well what happened at dinner?
Uh...no. No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy.
Everybody...
Now, does it really matter?
Ohh...
'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.
For every night that you're asleep before I get home from work...
I know that. That's why I was getting married.
Joey! Why did we have to rush out of there so fast?!
Oh, honey, don't worry. She's gonna make it on time.
What the hell is that?!! What the hell is that? Is that you? Ohhhhhhh!
I'm sorry, what?
Oh yeah, I totally agree.
She could be out of town. Maybe she'll be gone for months.
I cannot believe I'm gonna meet Jessica Ashley!
Yes, absolutely. I would wait and wait. . . then I'd wait some more.
No, I stuff outside the bra.
Oh God, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that you just forget that I told you this?
Men just take out wind?
Are you okay?
Yes, you're having a boy!
Luisa? Oh my God! Monica! It's Luisa!
Why didn't you get it?
Well, how can you be a tour guide, don't you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?
Umm, Joanna? I wanna talk about that interview.
...I mean it's my fault.
Phoebe, come on can we finish this later? Cause I wanna go running before it gets dark. Oh! Why don't you come with me?!
Oh! Ross is sooo great!
Why?
Hey!
I know, me neither! I mean, you had a sketch!
No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don't have any of those things. That's why it's so funny.
I just, Phoebe, said y'know thought she saw something between you guys.
You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. I mean, it's not sweet, it's not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear, I know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying, "Rachel!"
...the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you've grown. Y'know? I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, "Once a cheater, always a cheater." Ooh, I just wish we hadn't lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...
Absolutely! Absolutely!
Ross, I am a human doodle!!
Okay!
Well neither do I!
Yeah, I didn't want you to get hit by the boom!
Mom!
I don't know... sometimes it doesn't.
Okay that is the one we already have!
OK... see your two... and I raise you twenty.
Joey, what are you talking about? You're a terrific actor.
Oh, hi!
Yeah, but Mon that's totally different. He was you're health teacher.
And a nice hot cider for Monica.
Can I please be there when you tell her?
Ewwww!!
Yeah!
It's Joshua.
Phoe-be!!
Good for me!
Hey, can I borrow the key to your house so I can run across the street and make a copy?
Yeah. Yeah, I-I-I see the scare. Listen, Paul, I think this is really great that-that y'know, you shared your feelings. It's really, it's beautiful, but umm, what do you say we go share some food?
Off to see young Ethan?
Okay.
Well, well I can up with it!
Honey um, honey, you do realise that we don't keep the women's lingerie here in the office?
Ugh! Joey, I have to go.
Phoebe!
I cannot believe Ross is buying this!
Hi, sure!
Nah, uh, uh, uh, uh.
In Human Resources!!!!!!
Unbelievable.
...hormones, yeah.
See ya.
Ohh, thank you for my beautiul earrings, they're perfect. I love you.
So, what, you're just, you're just okay with being flaky?
You really think it would be that different?
Ohh, I love Joey! Joey lives with a duck!
All right, Julie.
So, I still have boxes here. I still have boxes at Ross's, and I have nowhere to live! Wow. I could so easily freak out right now.
All right. Let's say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?
What's this.
Oh! Oh, I love that but.
What time is it?
Yeah, yeah, I know.
But I...
That's right! You do what the hand says!
Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?
Noooooooo!!
Ohh, please! Cooking soothes me. Ahh. So, dig in!
Uh, to Stephanie Schiffer.
Hey!
Hey!
You guys, you're never gonna believe what I just found tacked up on a telephone pole! Look kinda familiar?
Stevie the TV?
Okay.
Yeah.
Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them.
I don't know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay? It's not a perfect world! Just go please.
Hey, y'know what? You're the one who wants to make this big change and move in with Chandler! You should be the one to go! Why should I have to leave?!
Yeah, which, by the way Chandler, I would like back one of these days.
What the hell was that?!
Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Okay. Wait! Wait!
Y'know what, I-I have to go talk to her, would you let me just get changed?
Well, I mean, do you think you can ever have both? Y'know? Someone who's like, who's like your best friend, but then also can make your toes curl?
She's totally right! When we were together, you got all freaked out about Mark and there was nothing going on.
Cecilia Monroe man, what a great actress.
So were done then!
But y'know, I never really had anything to worry about. Ross was never very good at the flirting thing.
Oh honey, but it is just about...
You are friends with Dr. Drake Remoray?
I don't want to say.
Sure! Why?
I'm okay.
Mira, Mira, el viejo desnudo est haciendo el hula hoop!
OK, Phoebs. But what about you?
And you know which one we should see? The 1996 Tony award winner. Do you happen to know the name of that one?
And all these people actually died?
Okay, thank you. That'll be all. Wait! Wait! Did you see that? That mail guy had no idea there was something going on between us.
I don't know. Do-do you have any clothes on?
But Pheebs, y'know you earned it.
Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me.
Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that locker room stuff.
Come on Phoebe, look at that! They are not breaking up, look at them. Okay that's, you know what that is? That is a, that is a second date, that's what that is! Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh...
Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Well, he doesn't really love her. I mean, it's just a rebound thing from me.... You'll see!
Well, it's embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy.
Diane Keeton.
So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by the time we're 40, we get married. I mean, we know each other, we like each other, and we've-we've already slept together so y'know there'll be no surprises there! You know what I mean? No like, "What's that?!"
Oh, hi Danny.
Hey, you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!
Ross honey, this is very nice, but, but I-I got a crisis.
Oh, how does he look? How does he look?
How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag? I'll pay.
Well, who wouldn't?!
Oh, come on!
Oh, I know...
Ohh, okay, how about five. Ohh, thank you.
Well, what happened to your jam plan?
Good!
Op! You're peeping!
It was unbelievable!
Well, you're lucky you never met that bitch Sharon Majesky. Anyway, umm... The rest of you life, y'know? Any regrets?
Okay, now what was that all about? Is it-does it not taste good? Let me try it.
So, like, you guys all have jobs?
Maybe. I-I don't know-Oh God, how could I be so stupid?!
Ohh! I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now!
What are you guys doing?
Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what?
Hey!
Credit.
No! Joey!
Oh it was great! It was great! I went down there just like you said, y'know? And we talked business. Kim totally took my opinions.
Wow. Is it, is it 'cause she's so cold in bed. Or, or is it 'cause she's like, kinda bossy, makes it feel like school?
Monica! Look! Hi! What do ya think?
They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then you can tell them I'm okay, okay?
Okay. Ah, well we'll just see about that, okay. I will read The Shining, and you will read Little Women.
So don't do it.
Fine.
Hey Pheebs.
Oh. Yes! I would so move out!
I just y'know, I didn't expect him to be this happy so soon. Ufff. Ooo-ooh!
You know what?
In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a Post-It on it that said, "Must go out today." So you just keep looking in there! All right?
Ugh, how can you even ask that question?!
No well, no it's not that bad, y'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up.
Okay-okay-okay! So, making things. That sounds like so much fun.
Oh.
For Ross, Ross, Ross.
I don't think so.
All right let me see. Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder, Elizabeth Hurely, Michelle Pfieffer, and Dorothy Hammel?
Then we took a walk down to Bendall's, and I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel...
Yeah! Sit!
Well of those things that you said in the interview, I mean if you believe any of them, I must not be a very good assistant. Y'know what? I am just gonna pack up my desk, and I will be gone by the end of the day! Well, I guess there's no use to me sticking around 'til the end of the day!
So-so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom?
Hey.
I'm thinking, I'm gonna order a pizza.
Hey. Oh, poor Pheebs.
I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.
What?! You got us evicted!!
Yeah, oh my God, tomorrow! That, no, it's perfect. Oh God, thank you soo much. Great! Bye! I got the interview!
Oh, y'know what you should get 'em? One of those little uh, portable CD players.
Oh yeah.
Oh my God, look-look he's taking off her clothes!
Oh yeah, go ahead.
Okay, your band is playing at Arnold's, collect three cool points. Which means, I have five, and that means I get Joey's boxers!
Ohhhhhhhh God.
What?
Oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too?
Well, we have gotta find out if he's alive.
I don't understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a 'big, dull dud.'
I'm fourth! Look at you with your little maple syrup award!
No, you're right. Well, we'll find something. Let's just get you out of that. Come on.
Uh, no she doesn't but I can, I can get a message to her.
No, it was just the three of us.
I'm sorry Joey.
Up!
Me neither.
Yeah.
Hey!
Op! Wait, you dropped a pea.
Come on apartment! Come on apartment! Oh! I know queen is high!
Hey.
Joey, would you just come out here and stop being such a baby!
Oh?
Thank you Phoebe.
Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.
Hi.
I don't know.
Ross gave it to me.
You sure?
So, will you talk to him?
Wait! Okay!
Oh not-not so much. Umm, what-what do you, what do you mean is there something wrong with Ross?
How are you holding up?
They're male nurses.
Really?
What?! What?! My birthday's not for another month!
Hi.
Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!
That refrigerators don't live as long as people.
Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter's machine!!
Yeah, I know, I do. I really do.
So, um, did she...
No, wait. Wait.
We were on a break!
No, I don't.
Yeah.
Monica! I'm not gonna screw it up!
No! Really, no, please, please, that's, that's okay.
I... Well, I don't think they need any help.
We're not actors.
No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.
You just don't look old enough to have a twenty-year-old daughter.
Oh really, OK.
Thanks, Mon.
Oh! Look what happened! {Don't get your hopes up guys, we only get to see her from the back or from the neck up. Its times like these I wish that the networks would broadcast some nudity other than Denis Franz's butt.} Huh, check me out! I'm in my kitchen...naked! I'm picking up an orange. I'm naked! Lighting the candles, naked, and carefully.
Hello! Here we go!
Oh, wait-wait-wait...
Ohh, so no sign of Emily huh?
Oh my God.
No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... : W-well, what else did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?
Hey! What's goin' on?
Hi!
I really think you need to go now.
Oh so you know that, you guys talked about that, so you get along, so you think you're gonna go out?
Hi Joey, how ya doin'?
Umm, or, maybe, I should stay away from all men.
Or Carol! But they're funny to kids and who is it hurting?!
No it's not!
No, no, no, you said, "got the keys".
What about you honey, who would be on your list?
Chandler!! Promise me, you will end it.
Did you know he was in there?
What do you mean?
The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!
No, it's all right, you can just drop the act Tommy. I know what's going on here. Your Danny's wingman right? You guys are best buds. Frat bros!
Please! During that second time you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup!
No!
Ok. That's fine.
Great! Thanks!
Oh man!
Oh my God! Oh my God! Thank you! That was the fire department, there was a fire at our place!
And uh, he will have a white wine spritzer.
Oh but Phoebe, we're gonna be late for the movie.
Well, that's a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.
I'm funny? Oh thank God! Well hey, I've got a ton of these! Umm, oh hear-Do you want a good one? Here's a good one. Umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge. Right? And then you say to person, I bet you can't roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face. And then when they do it, they're left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face.
Oh, look at the little cat!
Yes! I will! Absolutely! Hello, Rachel. Hi, Joshua. I left my wallet here on purpose. Really? Yes, I just wanted to see you again. Oh, I'm glad. Rachel, I'd like to say something to you. Yes? How you doin'?
Um, hum.
Ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big.
What?
Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?
Why not?
Well maybe he's just taking a nap.
Hey, you guys...
I didn't! Even when I found out...umm, all right, well let's just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it.
Ehhh, no, I wanna do Phoebe's thing.
Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone.
Hey!
Uh, I will see you... and I'll raise you. What do you say... want to waste another buck?
That's weird, she locked the door.
Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!
Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.
Whoa! Wait! Hello! What about me?
Ohh! Phoebe, this is all your fault! Now he loves her, he's gonna marry her, and this is all your fault.
Allll done!
No! Ross, come on! No! Listen, look I thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, Ross, is we can not stay married.
Okay.
I'm just cleaning up.
Well, Ross, we were worried about you. We didn't know how you were going to react.
Yeah. It's just gonna be too hard. Y'know? I mean, it's Ross. How can I watch him get married? Y'know it's just, it's for the best, y'know it is, it's... Y'know, plus, somebody's got to stay here with Phoebe! Y'know she's gonna be pretty big by then, and she needs someone to help her tie her shoes; drive her to the hospital in case she goes into labour.
D'oh!! I've got it!
They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!
I know.
I'm not asking you to go on a date with him!
Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head!
See Pheebs, I promised you no one would die, didn't I?
Well, I just lost a job, and I'd like to raise the bet five bucks. Does anybody have a problem with that?
Oh Mom!
Oh.
Pam! Oh God okay, just imagine this, "The Pam."
OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is very important.
Hey.
Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does. But I have to tell him how I feel! He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.
Guess!
Oh well, you don't want to do that now?!
Then how come it is?
Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh!
And then Jean-Claude took me to that place Crossroads and that's where we hung out with Drew Barrymore.
God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was...
Yeah but, my assistant Tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch. Ohh! I could just spread him on a cracker.
Did you just say Hi, Jew?
That was you?! We heard about you in Junior High! Did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout, "I will be revenged?!"
Ross, Ross, please listen to me. Ross, you are so much better for me than Paolo ever was. I mean you care about me, you're loving, you make me laugh.
"...marenge, thank you honey, and do the cha-cha. And while she like to be a star, Tony always tended bar. At the, wait, wait, everybody.."
Joey no, this is wrong! You have to take it back, okay? You don't want to win an award this way. You're very talented. And someday you're gonna win one of these for real and that one is gonna mean something.
Oh, I mean she's gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and people will be whispering, "Oh that poor girl." Y'know? Then she'll have to come back here and live all alone.
Hi, thanks for coming.
Yes, and grumpy.
What?
Honey, I'm sorry.
Ugh!
Hi. Well hey, you don't - you don't think they're kind of cool?
Space cowboy!
Oh, no problem. I'm so glad I could help. Happy for you.
I still don't get how you know when it's false labour.
Well y'know, we did other stuff too.
Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight. I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding.
Hey, Sophie!
Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people.
No.
Yeah, and not a very good one.
Of course I packed! Monica relax! I just wanted to ask Phoebe her opinion on what I should wear tonight.
Yeah, yeah, I was just about to take a break anyways, so...
Okay. Oh wait, wait-wait, you're not gonna come with me?
Pheebs...
God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have got to get my license renewed.
I'm not gonna marry Chandler!
Fifty-two minutes. So no-no brothers and sisters, huh? That must be nice. You don't have to share stuff.
Well, I was thinking maybe a um, a romantic dinner with um, candles and wine and then uh, maybe going back to my place for um, dessert.
Jean-Claude she said yes, I'll see you tonight. Thank you.
How are you?
Hey, you.
Was she good?
What did you get her?
Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick- you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
Yeah, it sure is!
What am I making him by the way?
You're twins?
Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life.
Pheebs, I don't think anyone's mad about that.
No, happy for you!
Oh! You are?
Sure. You got it. Great!
What?
Oh, thank you that's very helpful, I'm glad you came over.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Y'know you're-you're probably wondering about the old date on there.
Hey, listen umm, what-what are you doing tonight?
Phoebe, what the hell are you talking about? Other than their names being similar, I'm sorry, I do not see what you're seeing.
Come on you gotta have one!
What?!
Daddy... Daddy... Daddy, why whyyy would I sleep with Billy Dreskin? His father tried to put you out of business! ...dead!
You can't just say, 'Nice to meet you, good night?'
Well if you go to Disneyland, you don't spend the whole day on the Materhorn.
4 o'clock. Food?
Yeah. Oh, yeah. And I mean, the connection, I mean y'know, emotionally, mentally, physically...
Okay.
Really?!
Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good?
Ok, here, I know what we can do.
I don't know, I, I feel like I had a dream about you last night but I, I don't remember.
Nooo!
Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice.
Yes! Did you see that?
Oh.. a little..
I'm not gonna gooo, so I think that will accomplish the not going.
Because you are my sister and Ross and I have this huge history...
What? Wait, what?
Ohh wow! I'm sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!
When?! After the birth of our first secret child?! Ross didn't get the annulment; we are still married.
Uh, wh-why?
Hey guys! What's...
Oh, yeah sure, Ok.
Hi! So I'm out having lunch at Monica's and this guy starts talking to me, and it turns out he works for a buyer at Bloomingdale's and there happens to be an opening in his department. So I gave him my phone number and he's gonna call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview!
Rob Tillman!
'Cause I am really happy about us. I think we are, I think we are so on the right track! Y'know? I mean, I think we are working, I think we are clicking. Y'know?
Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, she's gonna get over this, y'know? I mean, so you said my name! Y'know you just said it 'cause you saw me there, if you'd have seen a circus freak, you would've said, "I take thee circus freak." Y'know, it didn't mean anything, it's just a mistake. It didn't mean anything. Right?
Well those are very popular frames.
I didn't. I got under him.
Mon, honey you're not dying. I'm just moving out. Y'know, I mean we're gonna see each other all the time.
Um, this is gonna sound kinda goofy but uhhm, my friend over there, who cooks by the way, um, she thinks you're cute.
This bench, it's hollow! I can't believe I never knew that! Oh, the presents!!!
I didn't... I never said that.
For...me.
Yeah.
What?!
Oh!
Oh, terrific! That'll be $2,000.
Well, don't look at me! My hair's straight! Straight! Straight! Straight!
Well hello! So, when are we gettin' back out on the water matey?
Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?
Amazingly, that makes sense.
At the Copa, Copa Cabana The hottest spot north of Havana. At the Copa, Coo-pa Ca-ban-a, music and fashion were always the passion, at the Copa....
Okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay! I got it! I got it! I got it! I can't! I can't! I can't! I cannot go with you and my sister thing. Okay? I just can't. It's just too weird, all right? I imagine the two of you together and I freak out. It freaks me out. I can't do it! I can't do it.
Oh... Oh my God. He remembered.
Yeah, it's kinda like a 'good luck on your first day' sort of thing. Is this actually a lunchbox?
No Monica! I'm serious! Oh, maybe I should just forget about it. Become a lesbian or something.
And y'know what else, oh my God, are they gonna love you.
Okay!
Ugh, those bastards! Let's go.
Hi!
Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.
Okay Phoebe calm down, there's no need to place blame. Okay? I warned her about those candles.
I know, I know. I went a little crazy.
Okay.
No so we're protecting her.
Oh! I would love to read a poem.
No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.
What?!
Well, I didn't see Joshua last night, but I did punch a girl in the face.
Hey he's wearing a sweater.
Yeahh, but, but those really go better with pants. Maybe I should wear pants?
You're out of toilet paper!
Okay, calm down, here they are.
Thank you judges.
Ross! I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey made a deal!
Are you, are you, are you sure it's ah, a new bump? I mean, no offense, I've always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child.
Ross! Janice?!
Oh great!
What? C'mon, talk to me.
Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too?
Ohhh! Well of course I will watch him! We have fun, don't we Ben?
Oh no! No! No-no-no-no! No, I mean come on that's-that's crazy-I mean that's crazy. So what's-what's going on with you? What is going on with you?
Oh wow!
Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid! I had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard! Y'know you-I couldn't concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me. I mean come on, you remember what's it's like to be 19 and in love.
No. Joey, she knows! We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment and we saw them doing it through the window. Actually, we saw them doing it up against the window.
Okay. Uhh, Ross, y'know what, there's something that I-that I have to talk to you about and everybody's saying that I shouldn't tell you, but I think they're wrong. I mean, and you know how people can be wrong.
Hey, y'know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I hate being alone this time of year! Next thing you know it'll be Valentine's Day, then my birthday, then bang!-before you know it, they're lighting that damn tree again. Ohh, I want somebody! Y'know, I want a man!! I mean, it doesn't even have to be a big relationship, y'know, just like a fling would be great.
Look Joey, I'm sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gotta tell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher.
Well, someone was supposed to write "Rach, take down the lights" and put it on the re... frigerate... How long has that been there?
Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee.
Hey!
Joey, did you my face cream?
Hey!
I'm gonna do it.
What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!
I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an extra ticket.
Oh, god, I can't believe one of us actually has one of these.
Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?
Oh God.
Hey, Mon, you want some help?
Well, sure, but they might think it's kinda weird considering I don't work there anymore.
I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.
Chandler, what are you doing?
Oh, I know. Look at him.
Bye!
Are you okay? You're not blinking.
Oooh!
Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don't get magic beans? I mean, what if all we've got are.. beans?
So who's idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?
There's been a teeny-teeny change in plans. It turns out that I'm not free tonight. So...
Oh for God sake just pick a piece!
Oh totally, totally. Y'know it's not that big of deal, we already kinda did it once y'know.
Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff.
I don't have any issues with my Father.
Hey! Out of all of us, who do you think is gonna get married next?
Joshua.
Oh, honey, that's so sweet.
How's Ross doing? Y'know since all the Emily stuff.
I don't have ten minutes!!
Cupid.
Wow! I mean, I just-I can't, I can't believe this. Y'know, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe who's always been somewhat of a question mark.
Yeah it is, mostly because I get to boss people around, which I just love to do.
Joey is says Best Supporting Actress!
Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?
Well then how come you're still at a job that you hate, I mean why don't you quit and get 'the fear'?
Oh!!
Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this.
Okay umm, Ross? I'm-I'm really warm, so I'm going to be taking off my sweater. Now, I'm just letting you know that this is not an invitation to the physical act of love.
What?! What else did he say?
Well, ever since I was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends, I'm just, I don't know, not in a museum benefitty kind of mood.
Yeah, well, I gotta work, I'm sorry.
Really?
I hate when Ross is right!
Oh, I win! He's got Barney's on his speed dial.
Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women.
What's the matter with you?
Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.
Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special.
Oh please. That Paolo thing was barely a relationship. All it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal sex. Ok, ya know, that sounded soooo much better in my head.
No! Y'know what? No! No! You thing was so stupid anyway, this was ridiculous-We're gonna flip a coin! All right?! Heads!
No? All right, here's the truth um, Joey said what he said, because um, I'm attracted to you.
Anymore!!
Oh.
Yeah.
Oh, Ross...
Well, then, you'll just have to eat the other lamps.
Go-go!
Look, I'm fine. Watch. Look at that. Whoa-whoa!
No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.
No. She doesn't die.
You don't tell a guy that you're looking for a serious relationship! You don't tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!
Oh, y'know what? That was a complete misunderstanding!
Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. I'm just gonna throw it out, it's probably just a bunch of shampoo and...
Joey, honey, I don't think you're supposed to go back there.
What?
Well, well, well, hop back in bucko, cause I got four sixes! I won! I actually won! Oh my God! Y'know what? I think I'm gonna make a little Ross pile. I think that one was Ross's, and I thinkohthat one was Ross's. Yes! : Well, I have got your money, and you'll never see it...
Ohhh! That is soo sweet!
Oh my God.
He's got this thing. And I keep telling him to go to my chiropractor...
Hi!
You.
Yeah well, you know what, so is uh, Sorentino's.
Ahhh, I think you look great! That bag is gonna get you that part.
What's up Joe?
Oh yeah he's too cute to be straight.
Ok, you win.
So umm, does it?
Oh! No, not really.
Waitressing?
Just a bug.
Y'know I can't believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!
I am not gonna get fired, because I'm not gonna act on it.
Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't this against the rules?
Honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people love each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous.
Yeah, see ya.
Damn!
Oh Ross, you're so great!
Oh! I've got a lot of those too!
Fine. Hi! Yes, I'd like to order a large pizza.
Oh my God! I bet that's him. My digital fairy tale is about to begin. I wonder how I should be? Should I be uh Hello? Or should I be Hi! It's Rach... Would you stop doing that?!
But y'know umm, Rachel doesn't rhyme with draddle.
Ross!
You're right, you're right. I should just tell her the truth.
Ooh, I have to go pack. It really does?
Give it here. Oh, God.
Okay, stop what you're doing, I need envelope stuffers, I need stamp lickers.....
So does it really hurt as bad as they say?
Oh... I'm sorry. I... I-I don't mean-I didn't mean to stifle you. I... This is all just a little overwhelming.
Hey! We were not on a-Okay. That's fine! Fine. Y'know what Ben? One day when you are a lot older I am going to tell you that entire story over a pitcher of real margaritas, okay?
I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!
Oops. Sorry! Well, good thing you number all of them, huh?
That's a good call. Right.
What?!
Oh! Ow!
Oh, go on! You telling people about me?
Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry I forgot, she's not a lesbian.
Please. I haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me? I mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! We went to camp together... she taught me how to kiss..
So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
Y-Yeah! What-what is your wife's name?
Joey, it's just a chair! What's the big deal?
Get your hands out of there! No!
Yeah?
Well that sounds fun too.
Hey!
Ross said there's still no word from Chandler.
That really is something; that's really cool.
Okay, uh-uh imagine this, "The Mr. Bowmont."
But, they're across the hall! I mean that's two doors away, it would take them a long time to peck their way back over here.
Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend.
Ow!!
Thank God. Food.
Sure.
Yeah, remember that thing I told you that happened yesterday? Well it didn't happen.
Yeah, but he waited until the last minute! So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. I said, "No!" Which puts me right back in the driver seat.
Hello!
Yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps, right?
What, what incident?
Ok, I just, I just really need to be with myself right now. I'm sorry.
You can?
We are so gonna find them this year.
I am so proud of Joey, I can't believe he's going to be on Law & Order!
Ooh, I've been better...
What?!
What are you playing with?
You have no respect for anybody's privacy!
Oh my God! We have to throw her a shower?!
Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem?
Yeah. I'm-I'm telling you he's really sweet and he's really funny and he's just ugh, got a good heart. And besides, I y'know, I think he really likes you.
All right Ross!! I get it!!
Hello.
Well honey, what about you?
Eww!
Yeah, she's...
Oh, I went to have pizza. With Danny.
Closure, that's what it is. Closure. Hello, excuse me. Excuse me, hel. . . woo
Hi! I just wanna--Ahhh!!! Oh my God! Oh my God!
Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.
Ugh, the worse day! Y'know, you think you're making progress at work and then your boss calls you Raquel.
But, it's not raining.
Yeah, I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass!
Yeah, you bet.
Really?!
Ohh, ohh.
Noooooooo!
Dad, dad. We got it!! We Got It!!!
Okay, Pheebs, y'know what, let's look at this objectively all right? Ninth grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So then...
Thank you.
Well I...
Since when?
I've never wanted you more.
Well there's yore. And uh, y'know, yesteryear.
Oh!!
Hi, I'm back. Listen, I need to...
Oh, that is so sick.
Really?
Aw, honey, that's so sweet.
Hello? Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you? Yes, yes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great. Really? Oh. Okay. Okay, well I'm working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can come by and... Okay... Great... Great... All right, so I'll, so I'll see you tomorrow! Okay.. Okay... Bye. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.
Anyway, I'm going to be the coordinator of the woman's collection, I'll work right under the director, it's the perfect, perfect job for me!
What?
Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend leave? Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She was in there, when I was in there?!
No.
Hi! Uhh, do you guys have plans for the weekend? Because I have my sister on hold, and she said that we could use her cabin for the weekend and go skiing. Huh? I'm asking you first, right?!. I mean I'm playing by the rules.
So were you guys together a long time?
Wow.
I hope it's okay.
When did you go to a sperm bank?
You're welcome.
Hey, hubby!
Huh?
I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.
What?
Phoebe, come on that's silly.
Hey...
O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.
Hi! Just so you know, we-we didn't mean to fog you, we thought you were like a yeti or something.
Storming out!
So uh, Pheebs, honey, how are those mood swings coming?
OK, you know what, are, are you being like, the blind date guy again?
Yeah! Yeah. They're...they're-they're my friends, uh, Monica Stephanopolus and uh, and Chandler Acidofolus.
Well, believe me, it's been a long time since I've been flung.
Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun.
What do you mean you quit?! You can't quit!
Hey!
Chandler gets it! It's Chandler Bing!
Yes! Thank you! Exactly! You want it?
Y'know who I always liked? Mork.
I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents? Why do they have to become people? Why do they have... Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?
Oh is it?! Uhh, hello? Yes hi, is Rachel there? Yes she is, just one moment please. It's for me!
Is this a little too... Pheebs, what happened?
We ended up having sex in his chair.
Well Joey, you'll probably get it. But you should probably your-your gracious loser face. Y'know when like the cameras are on you and you wanna look disappointed but also that your colleague deserved to win. Y'know? So it's sorta like...
Ooh, okay... good.
Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.
Yeah, at the lecture, I told you that last week, you said you didn't mind.
Hi, Pheebs.
Oh, I did!
Macadamia nut?
Oh, hey, don't you have to go pick up Emily?
Who was that?
That's fine!
So Pheebs, what is the book about?
What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment?
Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..
All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!
People are trying to sleep in here!
No, forget it.
Oh that's right. You're the talker. Anyway uh, great idea! Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues.
Right, yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors.
Okay.
I-I-I-I'm just...I'm just a good kisser!
Joey, you're such an amazing actor! How do you know where Dr. Drake Remoray leaves off and Joey Tribbiani begins?
No, no, ACC-cept that.
How about 600 and these earrings?
Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, let's do that Sailor Joe. Quick question though, what's this called?
Y'know, I'm still 29 in Guam.
No, Phoebs. I'm dating Russ.
Oh, it's a tattoo! That's weird, Phoebe doesn't... Wait that's Ursula! That's not Phoebe that is Ursula!
All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it ain't gonna happen!
Joey, why would you do that?
Well, that's great.
Oh.
Ok, I will have the uh, side salad.
Well, so then what are you doing to me? Okay? Just get out of here! All right? Move on!
Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm gonna go use Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom.
Yeah!
Hi!
What, what, what?
Oh!
Okay please, you're kidding right?! I wrote that one as a joke for you!
Pheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened!
Well, the first time didn't really count... I mean, y'know, 's'Barry.
What? It's true, my right leg is two inches shorter.
C'mon, you guys, what're we gonna do, what're we gonna do?
Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts!
Joey!
Well-well, I don't know Ross-really?
Monica, what should I do?
Oh. Oh!
As I was saying... I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I'm 35 which gives me five years. I love this plan! I wanna marry this plan!
Yeah. Thought I'd give it a shot. I'm still on the first chapter. Now, do you think his 'love stick can be liberated from its denim prison'?
Hey Mon, what are you doing now? Wanna come see a movie with us?
Oh!!
Well y'know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time they're 40, they marry each other.
So. Ross, I've bugged him about this a million times, he's not gonna change.
Well, alright, then, forget it. Might as well just go home. Ow ow ow ow!
Still in love with?!
Chandler honey, I'm sorry. Ok, can we watch Joey's show now please?
Yeah? Well, you should know. You've bought like a billion of 'em.
Yeah? I'm sorry about your girlfriend.
Somebody got in late last night.
Anyway, there's this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren bought a table, so I kinda have to go...
Monica, what are you doing?
Five.
So, come on, what was the big news Pete wanted to tell you Mon?! Or should I say Mrs. Monica Becker?
Hey, guys, what's up.
Ugh!
Pretty well, actually...
Monica, you don't even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!
You just finished?
Yeah, we found them. There were in the guest room closet behind some coats.
Look at that! Look at that! We all do it. Okay, I'm stopping now.
Right, and the humiliating.
Hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me! At least he bought me something with it!
You're hurt!
Okay! Okay! Umm, Webster's Dictionary defines marriage as... Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay, never mind! Forget it! Umm, umm, okay, uh... I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six year old.
Ross, it's too hard.
You don't.
Wow! I did not see that coming.
Well, why shouldn't I be? I have great friends! I have a wonderful job!
I'm talking about a bet, winner takes all.
Wow! This place is fabulous!
But he has to know how I feel!
Call her! Call her now!
But I hired you!
Yeah actually, I think we're gonna take off too. We rented a movie.
Jill, honey, I think this is the best thing that could've ever happened to you. I mean you needed to get out on your own anyway! And you know when I did it, I-I-I at first I was scared, and look at me now! I'm the only daughter dad is proud of! Okay, well this is, this is what you're gonna do. You're gonna get a job, you're gonna get an apartment, and then I'll help you and you can stay with us. Right Pheebs, she can stay with us?
Ooh, your brother. Score!
I know.
I'm sorry, they were just all coming at me, and I didn't know what to do.
You stole the phone!
So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt!
Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, I've known them separately and I've known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.
Can't I just look at the handles on them?
Oh but he did say that they found the grandmother wandering down fifth avenue.
Well, I just called Joshua...
Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.
The thing is y'know, that you're married to Emily.
All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen.
Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend.
All right. Be sexy.
Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July.
Oh, this lipstick looks just great on you.
Good ones?
Huh?
Okay, I need a, I need a drink!
You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don't tell the guy that!
Oh, come on! I'll give you ten free Ralph Lauren shirts.
Please, no, go, that'd be fine!
Oh, now see that's a fancy but.
No Ross!! Don't! You can't just kiss me and think you're gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesn't work that way. It doesn't just make it better. Okay?
Oh, that's OK, it's just the shoulder, it's not my dress.
Okay, he's a, he's a black capuchian monkey with a white face... ...with, with Russian dressing and, and pickles on the side. Okay. Thanks.
Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.
OK.
I can't, I gotta go.
Well do you get to look through one of those like, those periscope thingys.
Really?
Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju- Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look, look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel, but it isn't me, it's not me. And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but you just have to give me a chance too...
Phoebe you can't have both of them! You have to pick one!
Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! I'm leaving! You are just a horrible person!
Oh, okay!
Oh, y'know, would you just for once, not remember every...little...thing!!
Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing.
I mean you definitely should do that.
Oh yeah, c'mon, I'm movin' on. He can press her up against that window as much as he wants. For all I care, he can throw her through the damn thing.
Well, I'm sorry I'm not going to an eye doctor!
Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?
Well, hello, Mr. Rachel!
How did it go with Erin?
Tell her to wear her own earrings.
What's going on?
Well, from me. And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite.
Look at that!
Oh, great!
No..!
I did, Monica was so sweet she left a little mint on my pillow.
For Stella! Remember? She's gettin' her grove back in like 20 minutes.
You're a pathetic loser, right?
Hey! Hi!
Hmm.
Sorry. Sorry.
What?
Hi!
Okay get your coat! Oh! When did you unhook this? Nice work!
Just sit over there!!
Okay, so let's play for some pepper! Stop spending my money!
You get away from me!! You sick, sick, sick, sick-o!!
Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!
What?
Ooh, Phoebe's here! Okay, let's turn out all the lights and we'll just watch the movie!
Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?
No! I'm sorry, honey, it's just that last week I got all but three answers and I really want to finish a whole one without any help.
Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!
No, you're not an idiot, Ross. You're a guy very much in love.
Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be... ... oh, the foot of the bed.
It's me! Good morning!
She didn't hang up either!
These are from Halloween three years ago.
Ohh! And I'm one of them!! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!
Yeah hon, it can't hurt to put your name down! I mean in if two years if you're not engaged you just don't use it.
Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job.
Okay. Oh wait! One more thing umm, do-do we still need to uh settle the question of "us?"
Ok. Look uhh, Mon I'm, I'm really sorry.
A pajmena?
Well, I brought the next best thing.
Okay? You ready?
All gone! So, farm birds, huh?
Ahh, yes, I will have a glass of the Merlot and uh, he will have a white wine spritzer. Woo! Hey, look at that, the airport's moving. Hey, are we moving?! Are we moving? Why are we moving? Hey, time-out, umm, yeah, does the captain know that we're moving? Oh my God. Oh, my gosh.
I know.
You wanna go inside and have some coffee?
Oh, yeah, sure, it's umm...
Ohh...
Oh. Listen, I'm so sorry. I would, I would've never fogged you if y'know if you hadn't looked so.... Y'know.
Sit!
What? Come on, you do what you want to do. Do we always have to do everything together?
Wow. Well, I guess it was Cupid who brought her here.
Ughhhh!! Forget it! This is, this is not how this is supposed to happen.
This is Joey, and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross.
What's this? Is this Ross's wedding invitation?
Oh, what a fun office.
What? You just click when they click.
What?
They're not true?
No! Don't say that! Don't say that!
Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?
What-what-what are you gonna do?
I know. Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that? Listen, I'm gettin' something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?
Yeah, I forget which ones.
It's the woman from the hospital admissions office. She says there's a problem with the form. Oh, god, oh god...
Okay.
What?
Joey! I can't believe you just did that!
That was amazing. I can't even send back soup.
Hello!
Hey Mon, let's give Pete a chance Come on, he was funny, he seems really nice, and that check thing was adorable.
Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!
Yes, but I, I think about who's apartment we're gonna sleep at tomorrow night and, and where we're gonna have dinner next Saturday night. I do not think about what our childrens' names are gonna be. You know what our childrens names are gonna be.
Yes!
Ohh!
You wanna go in the bedroom? It's a little more comfortable.
Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him. Now honey, you take care, you don't have those babies until I get back.
Well, y'know this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea.
Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.
Oh no, I'm sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I saw you.
And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?
Do you really want an award you didn't win?
No! I mean come on! This is a huge deal! Fine I want-I need more details, who-who initiated the first kiss?
I'll do it.
I did it! Oh! I finished it! I did it all by myself! And there's nobody to hug!
Wow! H-umm! Hi! Yes, uh I'm sorry the models are actually down the hall.
I'll get the hat.
Okay fine! I'll-I'll just tell her it's an antique apothecary table, she doesn't have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at this little drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs.
Hey, it's not that big a deal, I was just curious.
Okay. Every time.
Coming.
Oh-oh!
Okay.
Will you stop calling it your apartment!
Why, when did you get out of the game?
Good, good, good, good, good.
Oh, this is so cute.
Well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with Capri pants.
Ross, my father doesn't hate you.
No Mon that's not the point. I'm out a thousand dollars, I'm all scratched up, and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand!
Goodnight.
Ross kissed me.
Ooh, I like those sunglasses.
Here he is. Hi. Guys, this is Russ.
Oh, get out of here!
I don't know, I don't know.
I'm sorry your wife is gay. I guess women aren't that great either.
Good luck Chandler.
Yeah.
Yeah honey, I'm standing right there! Why didn't you just tell him about the mole I haven't got checked yet.
Why?! What is it?
All right.
OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus- Ow. That hurt
All right, well how much time do you need?
She asked-asked you out again?
This is just occurring to you?
Okay, I'll see you back at home, if I ever get a flight out of here.
Oh yeah.
Oh Monica come on, y'know I don't sleep with guys on the first date!
You are soo enjoying this.
Oh god.
Joey, how do you make that dirty?
No no no, wait, I wanna see what happens.
Bye-bye-e!
What party?
So umm, what's this book about?
Okay!
Oh yeah. All right, back to work.
Okay, maybe they are not funny to you...
Oh, well, it pretty much sucked. How was yours?
Monica, you should totally put your name down on the list
Not stupid. The very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and I said "yes."
Just a waitress?
Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?
Go on! Go on.
During a blackout? He'd get trampled!
Hey! Hey! Hi! Hey-hey-hey, I'm Rachel! From upstairs? The ones with all the pizza?
But your divorce isn't even final yet.
Thanks!
Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.
No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.
I didn't have to, because I was wearing my 'I heart Ross' sandwich board and ringing my bell.
What's up Joey?
Monica.
What song was that, Pheebs?
Hey, honey! What's the matter? Fine, I was just trying to be nice! Whoa!
Honey, no one thinks you're a pansy, but we do think you need a tissue.
I don't know. I know I don't work late tomorrow night.
Because I'm going to London.
Hey. Whe-ell, look at you, finally got that time machine workin' huh?
That is not a problem.
Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!
Okay, coming!
Uhh, we still need a tip.
Ohh! This is so exciting! Oh God... Come and knock on my door...
Man in the black dress... Hi! I'm Rachel! I'm a friend of Monica and Chandler's!
Who's this from?
Thank you.
Well, apparently he scares easy.
Hey!
Alright, just put your hands out and I'll back up into them.
Am I going to let you watch me undress?
Yeah! Are you kiddin'?
Yeah, we're, we're actually just gonna walk 'cause it's right up there at the Angelica.
No, you know what, I think you should go.
Right.
Well, it was all Ross's idea.
Thank you.
Oh, was it awful?
Absolutely.
Oh y'know what, we don't have to talk about work. We can talk about anything!
No, I know! I get it! It's funny!
How-how did you lose your job here?
Joey, if you wanna look good, why don't you just come down to the store? I'll help you out.
Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge.
Hey.
Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary!
No! No! It's just that all the people in the entire world that I want to talk to are right here.
Smell familiar?
Y'know I can't believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!
You know what, it's feeling a lot better, thank you, um... Well, listen, why don't you two sit down and, and we'll get you some glasses... okay... STAT!
Oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat!
I can not believe he would do that to Mon-Whoa! Joey, do they know that we know?
Are you kidding me?
Oh Phoebe, we forgot that party we have to go to.
Hi!
Ohh, gosh. You guys, come on, this is-I have to meet Joshua! This is my one chance for him to see the fun Rachel. Y'know the "Wouldn't it be great if she was my wife" Rachel. Ohh, all right! Are Joey and Chandler back?
Nope. We took her to lunch.
Hey! So, did you quit?
Thank you. I...yeah.
I don't wanna hear "Three failed marriages!"
You have been maid of honor before?!!
Well, maybe they can find a way to bring you back.
Sorry-
I know. I'm sorry. Look, I'll make a deal with you all right? Okay?
Yeah but, you don't, you don't, you don't want to try to much too fast. Y'know? I mean, you do remember what happened to the little girl that tried to much too fast don't you?
Phoebe, you're on.
No, no don't get mad because look-this is what happened. So I-I started packing, then I realized, "What am I doing? I am lousy at packing!" Right? But you love packing! So, as a gift to you, on our last night, ta-da!
Oh my god.
Ross got married again-Nooooooo!!!!!!!!!
Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on.
OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus- Ow. That hurt
Oh, well okay. Well, there you go.
Ohh, you guys are so made for each other.
Hi, Mr. Treeger. Hi, it's Rachel Green from upstairs. Yes, somebody, uh, broke our knob on the radiator and it's really hot in here. Yes, it's, it's hot enough to bake cookies. Well, do you think we could have a new one by 6? Wha t, no, no, Tuesday, we can't wait until Tuesday, we're having a party tonight.
Ross, honey, it's a nice couch. It's not a magic couch.
Uh-huh.
Oh-oh, sorry, it's this way, it's this way.
Great, people having sex, that's just what I need to see.
All right, so are we not having dinner at all?
Right.
What?! You say that to kids?!!
Oh my God, I'm starting to look like my great aunt, Muriel.
Yes.
Happy New Year, Joey!
Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.
Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!
Okay, umm, I'm gonna get my sweater.
Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! She's coming!
So, which of this kitchen stuff is mine?
Oh, youre gonna be great!
Don't you have a laundry room in your building?
What?
Oh...
Oh my God you're amazing! Did you just pull that out of her purse?
I did not sell you out.
Well, then talk!
Oh, all right. But y'know I gotta say, I don't, I don't think six years counts as an era.
Hey Joey, can I...
OK... ah, it's light... ...it rattles... it's... Travel Scrabble! Oooohhh, thank you!
Chandler, don't worry! This doesn't make you any less of a guy! That does! What am I sitting on? I hate to think what this woman was scratching when this broke off.
Ahh....So...Wow...The spring line, it's really going to be great this year, huh?
Well, I-I know you can do that too. I'm just, I'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to... Hi!
Ohh that's nice.
I don't know! I mean, we still care about each other. There's a history there. 'S'like you and Carol.
Yeah.
Well, get 'em out of here! What's wrong with you?
Hi.
Well it's hard to tell... Oh God, if she would just stop moving.
Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants.
Hi!
Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!
Nobody does honey.
All right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating Bob!
Hi!
You see, now, I would date this girl. She's cute, she's outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. I mean, that's got to come in handy
Have you ever seen so much crap?
Look, either help me or go.
No! They didn't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems?
Yeah Melissa, I don't want to be known as the uh, office bitch, but I will call your supervisor.
Richard? I'm not gonna go see your ex-boyfriend!
Yeah. Umm, unless you wanna come inside?
Alright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecoming queen and the class president and you... were also there! But if you take this monkey, I will lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him. C'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here! Take it!
Did you just break the radiator?
Really?
But Joey you don't have $20,000!
You know what, I'm gonna do that, I'm gonna call him up, and I'm gonna ask him out. I can do that. Ask him out. How you doin'? Hi! Joshua? It's Rachel Green from Bloomingdale's. Yeah, umm, I was wondering if you umm, if you umm, left your wallet at the store today? Well, we found a wallet, and we- the license? Well, that is a good idea! Uh, well, let's see here this says this license belongs to a uh, uh, belongs to a mister uh, Pheebs, and umm, yeah, so sorry to bother you at home. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. You've done that a thousand times?
Wow, you guys, this is big.
Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.
Yeah, this is Tag. Tag, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
Where are you going?
How did it go?
Oh, come on! We know what these are worth.
Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um, second of all , what?
Hi! Wh-what are you doing here?
He just kept asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking.
Yes, I know that. I know that. And I know that hiring him was probably not the smartest thing that I've ever done. But I'm telling you, from this moment on I swear this is strictly professional. Yes?
Any luck?
Oh yeah, they're really great! Aren't they?
Joey! Come on! I don't wanna make any mistakes, alright? This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like "Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?"
Monica, please?
Did-did you come up here to work on that term paper or something?
That's not true!
I'm sorry.
Oh my God! What happened?
Wow, he's cute, Pheebs! But I thought you just started dating that Kindergarten teacher.
Oh no.
What's that? What? I saw my name. What is it?
Oh how can you possibly know? Look at this mess, Tag! I mean, this is what I'm talking about! You have to be organized! You've got newspapers! You've got magazines! You got-Ohh! And who is this chippy? A little young for you Tag, but whatever.
What?!
Yeah but Phoebe...
So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
Ok, doggie get the- aahhh. Ok go get the sandwich, get the sandwich doggie. Good doggie get the sandwich, get the...ok, Joey, the dog will lick himself but he will not touch your sandwich, what does that say?
Hi, remember us?
Oh!
No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know. Uh, I just liked it better before it was better...
He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you've been working here two days? That's not, that's not right.
Well why didn't you take the job?
Really. Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better, when I was engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too.
Monica, y'know what? The only reason I did that was because your party was so boring!
Oh, it's so easy for you I mean, you're not married, you get to have sex with who ever you want!
No, honey, they're not, but don't worry, because we are going to find them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok?
Oh, look at me, look at me. Oh, I'm on a date with a really great guy, all I can think about is Ross and his cat and his... Julie. I just want to get over him. gosh, why can't I do that?
Oh my God! That's so great! I'm so happy for you guys!
Really?
Oh yeah.
Uhh, because I'm trying to play hard to get. Oh, quick he's looking over here, say something funny.
Why does it matter so much to you?!
Yeah and you had fun teaching him how to be all Joey.
Noooo, no, I'm not mad at him. I'm.. I'm not really anything at him anymore.
Well what is it? Let me see.
Thank you.
Uh, yeah, if you want too.
Ohh please don't be from a real dinosaur! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Made in Mexico! Yes!! Ugh, who would buy this?!
Now I'm mommy in this little play? Alright look, I refuse to get sucked into this like, weird little Geller dimension thing OK. So I'm gonna go and take a nice long hot bubble bath because you kids are driving me crazy.
Why? Who's not having. . . Are you and Julie not, are, are you and, are you and Julie not having sex?
Ugh! Look you guys, I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't care what you think! I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson. Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?!
Here it is! I love it. I wear it all the time.
Oh, god.
Just a touch. Mon, I don't understand. I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms? I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh.
Hardy Boy.
Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.
Why? I love that thing.
Okay. Okay, see? I get the phone.
Hello, Mark? Hi, it's Rachel Green. Oh no, don't you apologize. Yeah, I'll hold. He left my number at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers.
Yes, but still. They're people...with eyes.
Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.
Yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree like that.
Fine. Fine, but I'll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel. And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I'll go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that's what you want!
Yeah. Y'know umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, Ross I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but don't you think it's gonna be weird?
Wow! I can't, I can't feel my hands.
Ahhhh!
No.
Let's go to lunch.
Phoebe are you serious?
What?
Okay.
Good, you guys are all here!
Oh, no! No you guys! Come on, you don't have to do that! I'm happy for him! I am! I really-I'm-I'm happ-I'll work on it.
No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex.
Well, I used to date him, but you're still going out with her!
This is Bonnie? This is Bonnie? You're Bonnie?
So, if-if I mess this up, there's nothing else for dessert?
Oh, God, oh, God, I mean it's just so.
Oh, Ross, c'mon. It's my fault, I almost lost your...
You know what we should all do? Go see a musical.
Well that too. Joey?
Oh my god. Oh my god. Excuse me. Move! Move! Emergency! Excuse me!
Well, I should think so. You slept with someone.
Ross!
Look, Chandler, he has moved on, OK, you have to too.
Horrible and degrading list of reasons not to be with me?
Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?
Yeah, I mean, you know it, I mean, if it were me I, I, you know, I'd want you to, I don't know, like catch me off guard, you know, with like a really good kiss, you know really, sort of um, soft at first, then maybe um brush the hair away from my face, and look far into my eyes in a way that let's me know that something amazing is about to happen.
And, I'll be nice.
Alright, c'mon! Let's play Twister!
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so bad. How did you leave it?
Whoa, look at you, you did pretty well.
I thought I was making him filet mignon?
Why do you care about the guy who won the Paris trip?
Well, okay. Would-would you get me a Diet Coke?
Okay.
What? What? He's interested in you. He-he likes your hair, he just wants to know how you got here.
That is great. Hey, y'know who doesn't have to job hunt? Ross. He works at the university.
Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here!
Yeah, well, y'know umm... No honey, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. Don't hit on your existing friends!
NO!
Monica!!!
And she's not crazy?
Yes of course, absolutely! You're right. I'm sorry.
Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio!
Ewww, ewww, ewww, ewww!
The bll is drrbing!
Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those? Y'know what, actually... Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?
I'm more than okay, I am really, really happy! Wanna know why?
Well, it's a long story, but umm I broke Joey's chair...
All right, you're the boss. I guess I gotta do what you tell me.
See? I've even called Animal Control!
Yeah!
No, I'll think about it. Yeah.
Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table.
Hey! Have you guys seen Jill? I can't find her anywhere.
Well, I'm sorry, I thought you needed them!
Ohh! It's so nice to meet you. Hello.
I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so sorry! I'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do.... I meanI'm sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I'm sorry.
Yeah.
She's actually very sweet and we used to be very close.
What's Flimby's?
Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.
She is not Rachem. What the hell's a Rachem? Is that some stupid paleontology word that I wouldn't know because I'm just a waitress.
Okay. Okay honey, he's fine, he's fine, let's just put him down. Come here, Ben. See that's a good boy. How could you do that to him!! Ross trusted me, what is he going to say?!
Hey.
Uh Pheebs, we just actually kinda wanted to be alone.
No.
Yeah, but, there were no suds.
Oh, wait and on the nineteenth a secret crush announces itself.
Well, it's my cat.
Well, if you see him, will you please tell him that I'm looking for him and that this I am not gonna throw up!
Hi, I thought you might like some ice chips.
Ha, I made you look....
Gone! I mean its amazing Pheebs. I feel so free and so graceful. Hey! Look out for the horse! Sorry!
What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?
Uh-huh.
Okay. Umm, what should we do for the theme?
Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?
Oh my God, what happened?
Did you ever do the-the Leia thing?
I'm not vanilla! I've done lots of crazy things! I mean I got-I got drunk and married in Vegas!
Oh my god. Janice, hi!
Wait! Okay!
Well, whaddya think?
Well, what do you mean?
Oh, wow thanks! Oh you're in real estate!
Yeah!
All right, straight, and not subtle.
What?
Ohh, he's married! Ross is married. I can't-I still can't believe it.
Oh, thanks.
I am not a baby! You know what? I swear to god, just because you get so uptight every time we...
Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
I know, I just didn't want to wear my glasses on my first date.
Hmmm... this is so nice.
Well, it doesn't sound like it! I mean, it's pretty easy not to kiss someone, you just don't kiss them! See look at us, right now, not kissing!
Joey! Come here! Come here!
Ross, why didn't you tell me that?
Oh, you know what? Rachel.. She just left.
Ross, I...
Oh thank you, Chandler, this is so great, she's gonna love me.
So what happens next?
Hi, I'm Rachel.
Oh.
All right!
Yeah! Why?
Wow!
All right, I'm gonna make more margaritas!
Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work?
Any chance you think the couch looks good there?
No, I have to go downstairs and come back up as if I'm coming home from the regatta gala. Okay? So just go distract him. But don't be sexy.
Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me. I'm a laundry virgin.
Oh, come on! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat, you don't think that's just a little funny?!
Hi!
Yeah, I just have to get dressed.
Really?
Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross?
Wait a minute, you're only giving free stuff away to the pretty girls?
Yeah! It's weird. But the thing is need to find a date.
You are so just doing this out of spite.
Hello, Chip.
Yeah? You like that one?
Melissa!
Well, I was gonna, but I accidentally read something else.
Hey!
Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.
Yeah! I'm gonna have a boyfriend, you're gonna have a girlfriend...
Bye!
Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.
Who is being loud?
I know, isn't he great? It's so nice to finally be in a fun relationship, y'know? There's nothing boring about him, and ah, I bet he's never set foot in a museum.
Oh my god. Ok you guys, there's Danny. Watch. Just watch this. See?! Still pretending he's not interested. Ohh, he's coming over. Just pretend like we don't know him. We've forgotten who he is.
Oh, hi.
Oh, hi.
Yeah.
Barbara! Hi, how are you? Uh-huh. No, I understand. Yeah. Oh, oh, come on, no, I'm fine. Don't be silly. Yeah... oh, but you know, if-if anything else opens up, pleaHello? Hello?
Uh, I don't have any brothers so I don't know, but uh, did you guys wrestle?
Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.
Well, yeah! I'm still pursuing that.
Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?
Yeah!
Y'know, I don't-I don't know. Let me, let me check.
Huh, that's funny. You look like you're gonna be the...
Yeah? Wow! Y'know, that this thing has speakers in the headrest!
I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.
Yeah!
Phoebe!
Ross.
What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps lying to me! That's it! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go over there and confront them right now!
Mon, honey, I gotta ask you something.
Oh, I don't know. Well maybe it's just the idea of Barry for the rest of my life. I don't know I think I feel like I need to have one last fling, y'know, just to sorta get it out of my system.
Yeah.
Yeah. So Frank, three babies. Whew, that just seems like a lot, huh?
Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?
Merrill Lynch?
I mean, it's a cat, y'know, it's a cat. Why can't they get one of those bugs, y'know, one of those fruitflies, those things that live for like a day or something? What're they called, what're they called, what're they called?
Do you wanna play football?
Vanilla?!
Oh my God! What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl that-that would just sleep with him?
32.
Some uh, some visual aides.
Uh, I-I had a drink with lunch. Did those cost reports come in?
Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....
Any sign of your brother?
Ahhhh!!
That's good enough. Right? Okay, well umm, I'm gonna go look at my books!
No that could kill her.
No, we didn't get married! That's ridiculous!
I'm sorry, I just can't go to the hospital lookin' like this.
Thank you.
Sure we should... So.
OK, OK.
Ohh-ha-ha!
Oh my God, honey, I'm so sorry!
Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?
I'm sorry, let her?
Ohh! You did not drop any socks!
Oh, it ended very well.
Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?!
Oh! I do not have chubby ankles!
Hey.
Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me.
Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.
Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy, y'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?
Ohh. Ooh!
She's still with you?
I cannot push it in!
Yeah, my mom got my dad's season tickets in the divorce, so she just gave them to me.
Oh my God! That's Monica!!
You guys, there's a little girl in Soho looking for this cat. I mean, you know what that means?!
Ok.
Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God....
Oh my God, I gotta go to work!
OH MY GOD!!!
Okay, well, I'm gonna clear out some of these boxes.
Oh yeah? Fine.
That is it! You just barge in here, you don't knock
Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written. No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a writer.
Oh my God!
Okay! "Hello Ross, this is Dr. McNeeley from the Fake Accent University, we'd like you to come on board with us full time!
Jo-Joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? Umm, I kinda got the feeling from her today that uh, she's not lookin' for a serious relationship.
Oh, I am so sorry.
Ohhh!
Okay.
Oh, I know, I'm sorry you guys. You're just gonna have to get used to the fact that I will not be dating Ross.
Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?
I know. At dusk. That's such a hard time for me.
Okay, Phoebe, honey, you gotta be kidding. I mean, you know you cannot keep one of these babies!
I'm a waitress.
Well no.
Oh! I have your key. Here you go.
Hey! We're here!
All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!
Ohh, ohh.
Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.
Yes, you do. When we left, you said, "got the keys."
Ok, I've got one. Wow, those things almost never come true.
Uh-huh. No, I hear what you're saying and-and-and that makes a lot of sense but can I just say one more thing? Look how pretty!
Yes, Ross.
We don't want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle.
December 26th, huh maybe she's Santa Clause.
Okay. I am so hot!
Oh my God, Jill!
Ross, you know what...
What was that?
I know you did! I bought the same one! And if she sees your table she's gonna know that I lied to her. I told her ours was an original.
Really? Really?!
Oh.
All right, cut, let's pick again, pick again.
No, I haven't had a chance to be alone with him yet.
Yeah.
Why didn't he call? He's gonna stay with Julie, isn't he? He's gonna stay with her and she's going to be all, "Hi, I'm Julie, Ross picked me, and we're gonna to get married, have a lot of kids and dig up stuff together."
Burning's good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn.
All right, listen, smirky. If it wasn't for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this right now. But I'm not.
Yes! Yes! Yes, I do! I do know! Frank and Alice are gonna want to keep all of their children!
Okay.
Hey. Oh, I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of the other two guys to go out with, who would you pick?
Well...
Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster.
No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.
Ok, Ok, Pheebs...
All right, okay, look, what if you could keep the apartment and get the tickets?
Honey, honey, I'm sorry, I know it's our anniversary but I told you on the phone I don't have time to stop.
Oh, it's a Macy's bag!
I think so.
Yeah?
Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!
Well mainly because he's kissing that other guy.
Fine.
Okay, hold on just a second. I'm sorry, it's for human resources, everybody has to do it. Could you just stand up please?
Okay.
Yeah, you know what we should all do? We should play that game where everyone says one thing that they're thankful for.
So, if I wanna have my kid when I'm 35, I don't have to get pregnant until I'm 34. Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity clothes! Oh wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant...
Ohh, are you setting Ross up with someone? Does she have a wedding dress?
Well you have to because maybe it's stupid.
Oh, yeah, I'm not, I'm not hungry.
Hey!
I don't know.
Okay, I need a date!
Okay.
Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much.
Well, I'm sorry I went out with him when I knew you liked him.
Yeah, well Betty's kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates. Now, while I distract her, you get in the office.
Now Joey, what did the duck do?!
What? Come on, it's not like I'm asking for this girly clock or anything, which, by the way, I also think is very cool.
May fifth, why?
No! Oh what does he know! Come on Rosita, us chichas got to stick together! You bitch!
Then what? What do you want?
Noo!!
Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left!
Steve... sleeve!
Wow! Umm....
Ross! We broke up two years ago; you've been married since then. I think it's okay that we see other people.
Oh right, 'cause you always pull your pants down at the count of three and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks.
Not for me. Chip and I broke up!
We didn't change..
That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?
Really?!
All right, look, here's the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. So, I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.
Great.
All right, first name on the speed dial is mom.
Yeah, he broke those too.
Oh, that is so...
Well, at first it was really intense, you know. And then, oh, god, and then we just sort of sunk into it.
I get to hire my own assistant!
Oh I...
Oh.... my God.
What are you? Monica!! Stop it!! Oh my God! Stop it!
Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!
Well, can't you tell her that you are not in the mood?
Just get out! Now!!
Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?
Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?
Carol...Lesbian?
All right! Who's are they? Who's are they?
Oh yeah. I used to babysit him. Hey, how's his dad?
She-she died Jill.
Where you goin'?
Thanks Chandler.
Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him.
Bye hon.
I'm not telling you what to do! I am telling you what not to do!
I did.
Oh! My hero! What happened?
Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell.
This is how I would hold a football.
No you don't!
You really, really need to get some sleep, honey.
Hello. I need to get on the 11 o'clock flight.
You guys are gonna love meee! Okay, check it out, Thursday night, five tickets, Calvin Klein lingerie show, and you guys are coming with me. Okay, I said that out loud right?
So?
Hm-mmm.
I'll say.
OK, OK. So, you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?
Oh yeah. Well, at least I wasn't too chicken to tell some guy I thought he was cute.
No, y'know what? It's gonna be okay. I mean you don't have to have this rustic Italian feast. Y'know? And-and you don't need, you don't need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack.
Oh my God this is sooo humiliating. I think the only thing that tops that was, was, was when I was in the eight grade and I had to sing the Copa Cabana in front of the entire school. I think I got about two lines into it before I ran and freaked out. Oh my God, my entire life is flashing before my eyes.
Ohh, God.
Just get away from me!
Okay.
So what are you gonna do?
Hey... hi, ladies... uh, can I get you anything? : Did you bring the mail?
Hi Pheebs.
What? Yeti-I mean Danny?
Wh... Come on! Remember? We were on the sleeping porch! We couldn't stop giggling? And our coconuts kept knockin' together?
Okay, stop-stop! Phoebe?!
That's nice.
What?!
Ok, so anyway, you were telling me about Paris, it sounds fascinating.
I can't talk to you. I can't even look at you right now!
What's up, Ross?
Arghh!!
Okay, what's up?
Hey.
Ross!! Oh my--ugh!! You kept count?! You are such a loser!
Okay honey, now I'm gonna try to listen from right here!
Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates?
Ross, you guys went out once. You took your kids to Chucky Cheese, and you didn't even kiss her.
All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!
Hi. I'm back.
OH MY GOD!!! Sorry, I was just imagining what it'd be like to catch the money bouquet.
Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica.
I promise.
Big night!
But, but?
Joey, y'know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.
Aahh, I'm a... chef at a restaurant uptown.
Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?
Uh-hmm, uh-hmm, yeah, yeah, I really liked your hands.
Uhhhooo.
Really?
Oh, umm, I was just y'know working out and umm... Oh, that's it.
How have you never been on Oprah?
Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier...
Oh my God! You're a 30 year old virgin!
What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.
Hi-e!!
Would you let me talk.
No, I know, they're from me. Look you guys this is not good. I mean we have enough trouble with guys stealing our wind without taking it from each other.
Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that? Especially you!
Ross, Chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he won't let me see.
You didn't break up with that fireman?
No honey, it's okay! Listen, I'll got to Ross's and get the blender, you get all the margarita stuff ready.
You did!
Honey, come on, I have to be at work in like ten minutes Oh, all right, well it's not like I'm employee of the year or anything.
It's not a miracle Joey! I'm sure there's some explanation.
We took our apartment back!!
Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and...
Okay.
Oh, come on!
Okay.
Wait, I'm not just gonna drink somebody's old coffee.
Yes, we should. I think we should.
Me, Fledermaus, great. I really-
Y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out...
No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us and she was all, "I'm Rachel Greep! I'm Rachel Greep!" and he let her right in.
No.
Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?
No, no, no, I'm looking at a purchase order right here and it clearly states that we ordered the Rivera bikini in a variety of sizes and colours. And.... What does it matter, what I'm wearing?! Can I please speak to your supervisor? Thank you. We're holding.
Come on, show me.
Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me.
I mean we're not, we're not gonna live together anymore?
Sorry I'm late, but I left late.
I think you should definitely go out with this guy.
Ya, know what Barr, I'm not gonna leave. I probably should, but I'm not, see 'cause I promised myself that I would make it through at least *one* of your weddings . See now, tonight, all I really wanted was to make it though this evening with a little bit of grace and dignity. Well , I guess we can all agree that's not gonna happen. There's nothing really left to say except.... "Her name was Lola. She was a showgirl. With yellow feathers , feathers in her hair, and a dress cut down to there. She would..."
Oh, yeah, right.
Look!
Pheebs, you go with Monica and try on her green dress. If that doesn't work, you can wear my gray silk one. Oh, gosh, what am I wearing?!
Oh, he sees her!
Agh, it was the graduation from hell.
What the hell was that?!
Yeah. Just, if it's possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?
Excuse me. Hi.
Oh that's right! I'm sorry! I-I am early! Finish! Please!!
I am still talking!! And then you chase away the one guy that I actually liked! I mean, no offense to you guys. Really! I mean congratulations on all the cash, and-and y'know--Wow! You do have very soft hair! But I would much rather go to the ball all by myself than go through anymore of this! Good-bye! Now do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair?!
Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!
Remember?! We-come on both had the sarongs on, and we had the-the coconut bikini tops...
Oh no, yes I do! I do! I mean, come on go on, you were, you were saying I am happier when uh, y'know?
Is Ross here?
Hey, come on! I had this friend from college and I made the stupid mistake of telling Joey that one time...she and I y'know...kissed a little bit.
I don't know, you tell me. One minute I'm holding Ben like a football, the next thing I know, I've got two kids, I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about the taxes.
Well! Is everybody else having just the best time?!
Okay, well this is all very impressive Hilda, um I just have one last question for you. Uh, how did I do? Was this okay?
Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before. Only $98.50 to go.
Hey.
Yes.
Oh, Phoebe, do I wanna hear this?
Well I. . .
I know!
Oh, well you know who I love the most?
Oh, she does want to.
Okay...
Okay, you are crazy! I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset! I mean, listen!
Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.
What? Uhh, Phoebe, honey, honey, I know you're quirky and I get a big kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature! Not nature, fashion!
'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.
Let me uh, let me ask you something, do wedding vows mean squat to you people?! And why is it that the second we tell you we're going out of town, bamn there you are in bed with the neighbor's dog walker?!
No! There is.. there is noone else!
Oh what, you-you want both of them?
What's the matter?
Really? Who would, who would you marry?
Oh! Yay! Look! There's a piece that doesn't have floor on it!
Oh.
That is the sweetest thing, I just....
Hmm.
What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?
Well, you're not totally paranoid.
Fine!
Come on! You guys can pee standing up.
Okay great, hold on a sec! Oh, here you go! You don't mind do ya? That would really help me out a lot! Thanks!
Thank you.
Oh my God!!
Ross said my name up there, I mean, come on, I just can't pretend that didn't happen can I?
Hi! Oh you guys look so beautiful!
Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, them we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?
Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, I'm sorry, but I don't think that was a romantic thing.
Surprise!!!
All right.
Yeah.
Monica, last Saturday night, what happened on Walker Texas Ranger?
Really?
Good. Although y'know, he-he's a private guy. Y'know, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.
Come on Phoebe! Don't be such a goodie-goodie!
Okay.
Actually, y'know that's not the Thanksgiving I was talking about.
That would be great!
Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. Maybe we should actually move Rosita out of here. Y'know, start the heeling process?
Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua's gone so you and Emily are free to go.
Why? Is he? He is! Isn't he? He's dating that slut in marketing!
Hmm-mmm.
Um... Ross?
Right.
It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.
Hey, do you guys have... ...hi.
Good different?
What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!
But! Don't you have to give him his money back?
Oh my God.
Yeah, there was. It was-there the corner of the library where-where all these dusty books that nobody ever read-Yes, there was.
Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't miss that.
Oh my God!
Wow! What's that like?
Uh well, y'know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day...
Oh God I just can not imagine what is gonna happen if Chandler doesn't show up!
Guess what?! All that stuff about Nancy Branson being a slut was all a rumor so Chip dumped her and he wants to come over to my house tonight!
Y'know what you should do?
No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did not see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson! I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which obviously is an impossible thing to do!
Hi, guys!
Oh honey he doesn't need my help.
I know, but it's just it's the first time, and I just don't want her to think that because I didn't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know?
No, there's a party. There's a party. But the power, that is still up for grabs. You follow me?
Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!
Do you want some pancakes?
Thank you, thank you, thank you, Pheebs.
Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment? Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!
See your twenty-five...and...uh, Monica, get my purse.
Why? Do you have the answers written on there?
Mon, Ethan called again. Mon?
I do the same thing.
Yes, yes, Bombay is bery, bery nice time of year.
Oh my God.
Well, I don't get it, but she wanted me to give you her phone number.
Thank you.
Okay. We'll be right back.
Ohh, whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on please hurry up honey! Please?
What'd you get?
You think I trust you with it?! No! We're gonna split it! You take half and I take half!
What?
She was kinda stupid. You're right. All right, I'm just gonna go on the date. I'm gonna go on the date. That is the new plan.
That is not true. She did! She forced me!
Y'know, I know it's totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common, and we don't even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd....
Oh God, I really had a good time!
Oh, this one's for me!
He didn't turn me down! He's at the game isn't he? I got the date, I'm just not on it!
Hi!
And um, what-what is that Ross?
Oh, ah with who?
Come on Joey!!!
Really! That-that great huh?
What's that?
You're gonna be late! Go! Go!
Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anything-minute. Okay. Fine. Abort the plan, abort the plan.
Hey!
Yeah. That's Daddy.
And there's a peach cobbler warming in the oven so the plate's gonna be hot but that shouldn't be a problem for you.
Oh, it's just like a bloodbath in here today.
You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where that T-shirt!
No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop.
That's-that's great! See? I already feel like I know you a little better! Thank you. Okay, come on. Now we can go eat. Let's go.
Yes, and I know that you'd say no if he asked you, but I'm sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin.
Oh, of course!
Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!
Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That is good news, Ross! I think that's the best news I've heard since Le Poo died!
I'm- uh- I'm okay... You look great!
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh God.
I don't care! I don't care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it's actually ended. And, I don't care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!
What? Shut up! We're winning!
Oh, hi!
Yeah-yeah, did-didn't you use to have a pair? They were really round, burgundy, and they made you look kind of umm...
This time it's not so funny.
But I do not want to have everything decided for me. I spent my whole life like that. It's what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left. I, I like not knowing right now and I'm sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with me you are gonna have to deal with that.
Okay, remember uh, remember how you told me that your grandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms?
Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it!
Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone?
Oh, yeah. Definitely you, Pheebs.
..so, he said it was just a sprain, and that was it.
Oh my God! Oh my God! I can't go! I'm gonna be too nervous!
Where did you get that?
This place is amazing.
Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua! Yeah, well, that oughta do it.
Did, did he just, did he, did he just say, he said bye. He said bye. You said, you said bye to me. You said bye to me.
What? Monica, they are cute, they are doctors, cute doctors, doctors who are cute!
Hey! That's just poking me in the eye!
Oh, yeah! Yeah!
Some of them.
Oh yeah.
How is that the silver lining?
Oh my God!! Great!
Not in the street!!
That'd be good.
No, I think I'm gonna catch up on my correspondence.
Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me.
Yes it is!
Okay! Okay-okay look-no I did, I just wanted this stuff and I know how you feel about Pottery Barn. Just... Come on don't be mad.
Right.
A lot.
Good!
This is Chandler.
Run Phoebe run.
No! They are mine!
Good bye!
No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.
Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how long, okay, you don't just give up something like that.
Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? I mean that ain't a pretty picture in the morning, y'know what I mean. That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know.
Oh my God.
She didn't hang up either...
That is so sad. Your missing out on so much, Ross. I mean, the bonding and the sharing, you know. And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are.
Now that you're on you're own, you're free to look as stupid as you like.
Okay, that doesn't help me, because we went to the same high school.
Okay, you'd tell me the truth. Right?
I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!
I came with Paul!
Noooo... the interview! She loved me! She absolutely loved me. We talked for like two and a half hours, we have the same taste in clothes, andoh, I went to camp with her cousin... And, oh, the job is perfect. I can do this. I can do this well!
Ohh, with who?
No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-I-would you-actually, would you go check on that?
So-Hey, Pheebs! So, how are the elves?
You are asking me to be your wife!
Yeah. Your teeth? Yes, I saw them from outside. You guys are never going to believe this. But, Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren.
Oh.
I cannot believe her.
Oh! Y'know what? You're right! We meet, you flirted and then bamn nine years later you had me!
Eh, do you believe that?
We're paying for this y'know.
Wait, but there's no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!
Well, what about my stuff?
Ow! Ross!!
What-what if I marry Ross-Or Joey?
Hey!
Hi!
From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.
Yeah! Okay, two larges coming right up!
'Cos I was gonna say there's no way you could've done the end the way you guys did it back then!
Hi!
Come on, they were not that huge.
Oh, you're not having fun, are you?
Well, look at that, same thing.
Ohh! That's so great!
Okay, I'm just gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready?
Y'know what?
A-ha!
Its still there!
Oh, my-my new assistant has very happy that I hired my new assistant.
Hm-mmm!
Come on! I don't want you thinking of me like that any more!
What?! Wait a minute! No wait a minute! Okay? Look, that night was the one wild thing I have ever done in my entire life, and I'm not gonna let you take that away from me! Okay, so if you don't remember that, maybe you will remember this!
Okay.
What?!
Are you gonna let me play?
Thanks! I've been here about six years, and Rachel moved in a few months ago.
Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh?
Well, I don't know. I called all the people in Monica's phone book and these are the only ones who could show up on 24 hours notice.
Oh good, great! I'll-I'll keep that in mind.
Maybe you should put it off.
Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?
And Monica, what are you going to make?
Ohh! No way Phoebe! I want to be Monica's!
Okay Ross, we're-wait a minute. Umm, I uh, I kinda have a little confession.
Hey, I thought that guy was married.
Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her.
Left.
Chandler!
"Oh, my, god."
Now that she broke up with you?
Really?
Well, I-I should've told you the truth.
Thank you. Hey-hey umm, uh, is there, is there any such thing as an annulment shower?
Come on! They rushed into this thing so fast it's ridiculous! I mean, they're gonna be engaged for like what? A year? And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what they've done and they're call the whole thing off. I'm telling ya, you're gonna be dancing at my wedding before you're dancing at there's.
Really?!
Oh, please, you wanted to get caught.
That's what I said.
Well...
Is he here?
Ok, well, not a problem. We'll just use them to stop the bleeding. Ok. Baggage claim? Ok.
Oh no, I can't tell you until you tell me what you know.
OK, I'm doin' it for ya.
Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like, everything. And for what?
They had to have that specially made?!
Okay. But wait!
Wow! Oh-okay, look pal, I am not in the mood to be hit on right now! But if you give me your number I will call you some other time.
Okay. All right, I see what he's doing! He's not asking me out, because he wants me to ask him out.
Sick-sick-sick-sick.
What?
I bet he sensed that I was ready to have sex with another guy.
All right, how about I go over there and I will walk into Chandler's bedroom and I will see that thing that I think that I know is actually the thing that I think that I know!
Ha!
Okay, swear you won't tell, but when Mark left he gave me a key to Joanna's office. Do you wanna see the list?
What?!
No, just singing.
Oh honey, I'm sorry.
Oh, I'm sorry. Ross Tillman.
But y'know what, if you think it's gonna be okay we'll just work out a system. Y'know, it'll be like college, I'll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign, "Come back later, I'm gettin' lucky."
Well yeah...
Nothing, I mean, um, it is your first time with her and, you know if the first time doesn't go well, well then that's, that's pretty darn hard to recover from.
And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa.
Oh, c'mon, Luisa!
Awww, just like his daddy.
Okay... Let me put it this way. Anything from Crabtree and Evelyn?
Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.
Hey.
Wait! No, that's ridiculous. Come on, he lives three blocks away!
Okay, just give me the damn drops!
Closer than here?
Oh, howd she take it?
Oh my God, Melissa Warburton. I don't think I have the energy for this.
O-kay!! See what you did, I'm gonna be doing it by myself now. Okay?
Oh, y'know what? I can't. I have to have dinner with that Melissa girl.
Ugh! Get out! Get out! Go! Come on! No! Not in there! He's in there!
Arghh!!
What?
No Paul, I don't know anything about you! Y'know, like-like your childhood! Tell me about your childhood!
I'm sorry!
No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different.
Okay, y'know what? I'll-I'll have toast!
Yeah.
How come you didn't come over earlier?
What happened?
Does it still hurt?
I hope it's still funny when you're in hell.
Huh. Well, uh, that's uh, that's interesting.
Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not.
Oh, my god.
And stop saying that! I hate that!
Tommy's supposed to be here soon, we're going to lunch.
Right, I'll see you guys later...
Hey!
Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.
Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place.
Hey!
Ohhh.
Tell him.
Oh, thank you.
Yay! Emily!
Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day though, I got to sit in on the meeting with the reps from Calvin Klien. I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie, she ordered a ton of it. How was your day?
Oh.
Oh yeah! Oh my God! That is our friend! It's Naked Ross!
Dear losers, do you really think I'd hide presents under the couch? P.S. Chandler, I knew they'd break you.
Hi!
Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?
Exactly!
All right, well the place was closed. I'll just copy it later.
Okay.
Hey! Hey, cute jacket!
Yeah.
Noo! Oh God we did-we didn't, we didn't uhh...
You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you've got a girlfriend?
I don't know.
How come we have one extra place setting?
And you know Monica and Ross!
No, see this isn't about the movie theatre, this is about you stealing my wind.
Umm, I said I thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that I like your tiney-tiny touchie.
Ball? There is no ball.
Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person.
Do you want to put the book in the freezer?
Yeah-yeah, we never had that,
I need some milk.
Because I lose her stuff!
Ross, can you pass me the yams?
What? Why? Where are you?
Did you not get a good enough look the other day?
Oh yay!
Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happen to me? A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine. Ross was just Ross, just this guy. Now he's Rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I can't have.
Hi!
You were really gonna do that, weren't you?
Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.
I can't believe I don't get to go to my own prom, this is so harsh.
Hi!
Yeah, right. Look at you, you're practically giddy.
Yeah. Well, umm.....
I got to figure out what I'm going to wear.
Yeah, well, you uh, better make it for three.
Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night?
I don't gossip!
Yeah, sure. All right, whose court is the ball in now?
Well,sounds like you two have issues.
All right.
Hi!!
I know! My God! Do you have your speech?
Uhh, the mailman, the super.
Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?
Oh, gosh, it's hot in here.
Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit! Y'know I just wish we could be like on a break!
Well I love you too.
Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn't a chair.
Interesting.
Ugh! I cannot believe Chip dumped me for that slut Nancy Branson. I am never going out with him again. I don't care how much he begs!
That's easy for you to say, you weren't almost just killed.
Hey, nice pillow. So now tell me, is this genuine Muppet skin?
Pancho Vila?
Yeah, come on! What's going in on in there?
Have fun!
Bzzzz.... I love you, Ross.
Oh, come on squeeze it.
Over here!
He doesn't speak much English.
Hey Joey!
Well of course I do! But y'know, favorite returning character is a tough category Joey. I mean you're up against the guy who survived his own cremation.
Eavesdropping. Pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down.
I am so gonna miss watching you freak people out like that!
Tah-daaah!
Well, he gets the other one all riled up.
Yeah, y'know what? Don't look at it. Seriously, don't look at it.
Nooo!
OK, ready when you are.
I, I didn't say any... I sw... I did not say anything, I swear. He stopped by.
Ohh no you don't! You got lighting last time, lighting is mine!
Okay, you know what? You're going to have to call that plane and tell them to swing around and come and pick me up.
What?
Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.
Yeah.
I had a bra.
Hey!
Well, that shouldn't be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.
I hate this apartment! I hate the color of these walls! I hate the fact that this place still smells like bird! I hate that singing guy!
Oh, could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?
Come on!
Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! I cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!
Well, Joshua's coming in tomorrow and since I don't have the guts to ask him out, I'm going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.
Oh! Pathetic!
Joey! Joey, good one!
How are ya?
Uh great! How do you feel about Diet Coke?
Yeah, yeah and you know what, I know she's gonna wanna run again, I just don't know how to get out of it, I mean, I live with her.
I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against that thing!
Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!
And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!
What?!
Just stop it! Come on!
Yep!
No. No, no, I'm not ready! How can I be ready? "Hey, Rach! You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?" Come on, I can't do this!
I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with it. I gotta get out of here.
Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!
Yeah, Joey kinda disabled it when I moved in.
I see your fifty cents... and I raise you... five dollars.
Ahh... Chandler's on the couch!!
Phoebe, it's okay. I like living with Joey.
All right. Woo! Hey, look at that, the airport's moving. Hey, are we moving?! Are we moving? Why are we moving? They said they were gonna wait! Miss? Yeah, does the captain know that we're moving? Oh my... Ross, you better be under the wheels of this thing!!
Right!
Oh, I don't know. I don't know.
Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to this?
Hey, how are those tapes working out for ya?
How is she?
Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!
But I...
I thought it was Chandler!
Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?
Really? Me?
Hey!
Hmmm!
Hey! Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?
No, hey, come on, if he asked you first, that's only fair.
Because I promised Mindy I would.
Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it's remotely related to the field they're interested in.
Uh-hmm.
Exactly! Unisex!
His new girlfriend!
Hmm. Umm, why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer?
Oh good. Ahhh! My God, sorry!
Thank you. Thank you so much!
Hey.
I'm gonna do it too!
OK!
Oh yes, absolutely! Y'know, it's weird uh, but I had a dream last night where I was stopped by a policeman. And then he uh...well I probably shouldn't tell you the rest.
Monica, you broke up with him for a reason.
Yeah, I do. I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear your head, I think it'd be really good.
Oh!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just...It's just so sad!
I'm sorry, as I was saying the store number is wrong, and I'm sorry but that's... Oh my God!!
Ohh, well, isn't that just lovely. That's something the two of you will be able to enjoy for a really, really, really, really, really long time.
And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high school, I was a cow?
Oh yeah!
: So basically, you get your ya-yas by taking money from all of your friends.
Well, it was a little extravagant, but I a pretty good deal.
Oh, what a load of crap. That is a dot. Your mother is up in heaven going, 'Where the hell is my lily, you wuss?' OK, Phoebe, that is not a tattoo, this is a tattoo.
Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question?
Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere.
Well y'know I was just in the neighborhood and I passed by your building and I thought to myself, "What's up with Carol and sweet, little Ben?"
So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.
How-how did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?!
No! You gotta get me out of here Phoebe! These bargain shoppers are crazy!
Ok, Ross, try to hear me. Ok, I, hey, I'm not gonna lie to you. Ok, it was good with Paolo.
Yes.
Phoebe, don't you think you've had enough to drink?
All right are you guys gonna come down?
Hi.
I knew it! I knew it, ahh....
What?!! Stop it! Stop it! Oh my God!
So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?
That yeti is one smooth talker.
Hi!
You brought a carrot?!
Okay.
Oh, me too.
Ohh, thank you.
No, you have it, really, I don't want it-
No. No, not at all, not at all. I actually was gonna bring someone myself, so...
Oh My God, Phoebe, that's not Ralph Lauren. That's Kenny the copy guy.
Yeah. Don't do this to yourself.
Awww...
Okay, well then how about a handshake? Oh God I'm sorry! Oh God, I'm sorry! I did not mean to touch that-I mean you there. There. Uhh, okay, so thank-thank you, I'm going to leave now thank you very much uh-huh, thank you so-Hey! I'll see you Monday!
Chandler! You're smoking? What are you doing?!
Okay, you gotta give me some of your piece.
High-five, the babies are coming!
None.
Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole "seizing" thing but um, Emily called you today.
I'm gonna need a copy of those.
Don't just say yes! This isn't a game, Joey you can really get hurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!
That's not the end.
Okay! Okay! Here!
Hey, nice toilet.
Chandler!!
Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady.
No we weren't! It was nothing! It was one night, senior year we went to a party, had a lot of sangria and y'know, ended up...kissing for a bit.
I'm sorry. I didn't-I don't come in here a lot.
Noo! Angels.
Well, things change.
Because she hates Pottery Barn.
Oh my god, oh, you guys are great.
No, I-I live with Phoebe. I mean you're alone, alone. And I just-it's just not the time for us. I'm sorry.
Together?
Handling it? What do you mean, handling it? There's nothing to handle. Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn't for me and Joshua. Y'know, they're not gonna get married anyway!
Hey! Ross, listen can you come to a charity event tonight?
Oh my God! Oh, that's funny, I can't believe I did that.
Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.
Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy?
Ok, you know what, lemme, let me just see what else I can do. All right, look, look. Why don't you just let her go on after Stephanie whatever-her-name-is. I mean, you won't even be here. You don't pay her. It's not gonna cost you anything.
Well, now, how come you guys have never played poker with us?
Well, because she loves you and because you love her.
Noo.
But I saved it. I put my basket on top.
So umm, what time are you supposed to leave?
I'm Rachel Green.
And with Chandler in the next room. What are you, what are you sick?
Awful, absolutely awful.
Now wait a minute that's not fair. He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn't tell me. Maybe I have to pee again.
Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she'd still be with us-nothing about an assistant buyer?
Oh, Kim, Hi.
I don't want you to see me naked!
Oh yeah? Okay.
What?!
Hey!
Okay, umm, I'm gonna get my sweater.
You!
Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!
That sounds great! I'd love to live at Warren's!! I love Warren! Thank you!
Okay-okay that-that's amazing. How did you know that?
Joey, I really don't...
No. No. Every thing's--they're fine. Great pizza. But it's uh, actually umm my friend Ross. He uh, just gets really nervous when he's flirting.
Oh, I'm sorry, I guess I just bring it out in him.
Mom, would you relax. That was 10 blocks from here and, the, the woman was walking alone at night, I would never do that. Mom, c'mon, stop worrying. This is a safe street, this is a safe building, there's nothing OH MY GOOOD, oh my God, oh I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go. OK, that's fine, you just read the paper, I'm gonna get a pot, it's not for you. OK, that's fine, read the Family Circus, enjoy the gentle comedy. Aaahh, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, aaaaahh. It's open you guys.
All right! Y'know what? That's it! You wanna do it?! Let's do it!
Hey!
Oh, Sophie, I guess you didn't hear about Joanna...
Nooo...
Oh. Oh, those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything.
Hi!
Meeting Julie.
What?
Oh, it's perfect! But not for tonight.
Huh, yeah I guess we are roommates now.
Ahhhh.
I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!
Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag. Oh, it does work!
And Joey....
Hey Mon!
Ok, we can do this now, can't we Ben? Yes we can, yes we can. There. I did it. I did it. Look at that, oh, stays on and everything. Hi.
Monica?!
No! Nothing!
Hm-mmm.
Oh, that is so sweet. I think I'm falling in love with you all over again.
Happy Thanksgiving!
Charming.
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.
Hey!
Oh Mon, listen I have to ask! Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls?
Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?
Oh umm, y'know I lent it to Joey and I never actually got it back.
Hey! Hey-hey-hey!!
Yep. Oh, yeah, look you great. Oh yeah. Yeah, this looks great. Umm, so you like it?
Aw.
I'd do anything for you, you know that.
I'll be out in a second.
Oh Monica that was the best Thanksgiving dinner ever! I think you killed us.
No, you don't, Ross. Imagine the worst things you think about yourself. Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you.
No you guys...
Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know.
Hmm.
Oh my God! I'm gonna have to find another minister.
I'm sorry Pheebs, I guess I'm just really said that I'm leaving.
Oh, hi Mrs. Lynch! Is Joanna in already?
Hi!
Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them together and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name, I never realised it, Joshua! Josh-u-a! Joshua! Josh.
This one's from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it's a book... feels like a book. And... ...it's a book!
One hour.
I'm sorry, I was just reading the joke below it. Man, that one is funny.
Ohh, yes.
I'm just visiting my good friend Carol.
Me?!
Uh no, he's not. Can I take a message?
Yes, his name is Barry, he's a doctor, thank you very much.
Oh my God! Are you serious?!
Ooh, the gift shop!
Hi!
True story.
Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee house, I'd be serving him sneezers.
Oh my God you stole her award!
There's more alcohol, right?
Okay, y'know what?! I know-I know how to settle this! All right here, this is what we're gonna do! I'm gonna write Joey on one napkin and I'm gonna right Ross on the other napkin and we are going to pick one! And that person is going to be our backup! Okay?
Are you sure?
What?! What?! What?!
Well no, I don't smell anything.
Maybe it's not as bad as I think. Y'know, maybe they didn't take it the way I meant it.
Noo! Maybe! I, I don't know.
All right, then you owe me $350.
What?
Wh-no, but y'know who did stop in here looking for ya, Tennille.
Oh crap!
So umm, how-how are we gonna mess with them?
What are you saying?
Yeah.
Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.
No, it wasn't. It was actually the...
Oh Ross, honey you gotta stop torturing yourself!
Wow! You certainly think a lot of yourself.
Hi!
Really?
Excuse me, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to call you back, I've got a Schemp in my office. What are you doing?
See?
Gooood morning!!
Ohhh!!!!
What's that?
Well...
Uh-huh.
Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed.
Oh God. No! Oh not again! This-this happened when my grandfather died. It's ugh! Sorry. Oh, okay, so I'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me?
I know. I know. Oh God. There's no tissue! Can you grab me some toilet paper?
To get you to make out with him!!!
Oo! When's her birthday?!
No, so I don't have to get married until I'm 33! That's three years, that's three whole years-Oh, wait a minute though. I'll need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and I'd like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged... Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I'm thirty.
Oh, y'know, it's just like hats, and a shirt, and CD's, just sort of stuff that you've left here.
Virgo?
I think they're very nice.
What?
Oh my God! Did you check your entire desk! Did you check all the drawers!
I am? Oh, look at that, yes I am. Enough about me, enough about me, Mr. Back from the Orient. Come on. I wanna hear everything! Everything.
Huh.
C'mon touch it.
Fine, I will.
Ohh! Hi!
No, absolutely. Y'know like it was umm...
Monica.
Okay? Whoa, wait!
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool out of myself.
Whoa-oh, what's-what's that?
Joey! It is an auction! You don't guess, you buy!
What? Wait a minute. What are you saying, that I'm a pushover? I'm not a pushover.
I'm sorry, I was just thinking you're day could still pick up.
Nope!
Joey, you're gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? You don't get any dessert.
Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit.
Then, you will definitely get him back!
Saw what?
Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex.
What?
Do you remember where the duck food is?
Ohh, of course Monica's brother!
I love working with designers!
Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya, baby! Darnit! Ugh.
Oh-oh Professor Geller.
Barry?
Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.
Well, I'm gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy.
Yeah. Look Joey, it's enough all right?! You keep making these stupid jokes and this sleazy innuendoes and it's-I'm not-it's just not funny anymore!
It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!
Oh dear God.
We do?
I don't know...right, he's the pig!
Ohh, I'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt.
Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks...
I got a touchdown! We did it!!
...it's gonna be okay!
Well relax, he'll be here.
You guys, does this look like something the girlfriend of a paleontologist would wear?
Oh.
What?
Huh-hoo, yeah, no, it's still basil.
I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, "I'll just tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours." And he said, "Laundry? Is that my new nickname?" And you said, "No! You know what your nickname is, Mr. Big."
So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if there's anything that you like, we can make you a deal. Anything at all. But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.
Okay!
Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the. . .
Joey, just-just he-he's new in town and I know he doesn't have any guy friends. Just take him to like a ball game or something. I'll really appreciate it.
Oh honey, I'll say good-bye to you at the car if you don't mind the puss.
No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?
Yeah!
Oh my God, look there's Roy Gublik.
Let me finish.
Ewwww!!
I don't know!
I just- I don't think us getting back together is a good idea.
Okay, very cute braces. Anyway y'know what, the point is Tag, start looking because you are going to find those contracts on your desk.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this.
Okay, but before you go, could you help me first?
Well, why do y'know go in that room and do your homework?
Yeah!!! Kill 'um!!!
Hi! Sorry- sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost track of time.
Yeah but, he's not your type.
Hello! Oh yeah! Hey! Hold on a second she's right here! It's Chandler.
And Chandler, you're gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know Raquel can't be late.
So you know, I...I handed in that marketing report and I never got to hear what you thought.
That's not European!
I know. I always thought if you and I got married, it would be the one that stuck. And it wouldn't be a secret, and we wouldn't have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut.
Ohhh, OK.
Yeah, just give me a minute! Oh well, yes, I can think of one good thing.
What-Pheebs?! Two dates in one day? That's so unlike you.
Huh umm...
Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.
Hey, what's-what's going on?!
What? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what's the matter?
I know, but all that work you're doing to get it ready, I just...
What?
And?
Huh-Wait so Joey if you get this, you're gonna be like the star of your own TV show! I mean you'll be like the Big Cheese! Or the Big Mac-Hey! You love those!
Well, y'know what? Thanks to you I'm half way there! Ugh! Oh! I am so mad! Ross, I don't think I have ever been this angry!
Well, then can we meet him?
Yeah.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh, what do I, what do I do with him?
For what?
What 'cha readin'?
Oh, thanks. So, uh, what are you gonna do this summer?
Y'know I don't, I don't understand guys, I mean I-I would never congratulate Monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin' her boob.
Thank you.
Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can pass on my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the coffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right. A smile goes a long way. And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin.
I mean if you think about it, I mean Ross did learn something from each marriage.
Oh sorry didn't mean to interrupt. It's just such a beautiful space; do you do a lot of weddings here?
I don't know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and y'know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.
All right, you know what, that's fine. If you guys want to be children about this, that's fine. I do not need to see it.
Oh-oh-oh, he's a transponce-transpondster!
Your company has a fine foods division?
Woah, woah, woah, what book is this?
Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.
Yeah right.
Because they're people.
Ross! Y'know what, I just got-why? Why did you do this?!
C'mon, I'm not saying it was a bad movie, I'm just saying, you know, it was a little. . . hard to follow.
What?!
Country club newsletter. My mother sends me the engagement notices for 'inspiration.' Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Barry and Mindy!
Hey!
Wow! What did he say?
Ugh! So close!
No don't! Go back to repeating!
Mindy, my maid of. Oh!
Ah!
Care for a cherry?
Oh right.
That is the most ridiculous.
Well we're gonna miss you around here.
Okay.
No!
Get the hell out of there, y'know?
Yeah-but come on-Listen, I'm sorry I don't want to make you uncomfortable, but I told Phoebe that it happened and she doesn't believe me.
Are you sure?
I won't speed.
Hi!
I-I-I don't know.
You guys are unbelievable. No! He cannot come.
What?!
Honey, I'm sorry.
Give me that!
Uh yes, heroin and crack.
She has got so much going on we-we have only two options. We have Friday...
Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.
Yeah. Hmmmm.
Oh, I know, I know, it's-it's so, it's so totally like, "Whoa! Can we do this?" Y'know, I mean, but I mean it just feels right! Don't you think? It does! I mean, it just feels right, don't you think?
Apartment pants?
Wow! How are you?!
What?! Are you crazy?
I bet you're a Gemini.
"Baddest man in the whole damn town."
Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you're sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
Ive never done that.
Yeah, I'm just mad!
EHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! My God!!!!!!!!!!! Oh my God!!!!!!!
You think about stuff like that?
I'm sorry!
I'm gonna get back to retraining.
That sounds great.
Oh yeah? Another night of birdogging the chickas?
I have so got it. There's gonna be rumours about this, there's no way to stop it. Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know.
Pheebs!
Oh! I used to do that too!
All right I know, I know how it looks Pheebs, but I'm telling you...
Oh my God! Look at this!
You said she was bald.
My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce. But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them. But you know what, you know what the good news is? I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours.
Yeah, it's in there.
Ben y'know when uh, when you were a baby, you and I used to hang out all the time. 'Cause I was, I was your daddy's girlfriend.
O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that...
What-wh-what so we'll just stay married forever?!
Stop it! Cut it out! Cut it out!
When did this happen?
Yeah! I am soo gonna marry that guy. Ohhh!
You fell asleep?!
Ohhhh. Honey, honey, honey, it's okay, it's okay honey. I'm gonna fix you a drink, huh? Maybe a margarita?
Well then I demand a recount!
Yeah?
Oh no, no, no. Oh God, you think I made out with him.
But you said that you liked him! I mean what happened?! Did ya just change your mind?!
Really! God Ross, what were you thinking? I know it's really shallow, but a part of me wants him again.
He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, ESPN! Just once and a while, have it on in the background. Ooh, this one was Pierce Brosnan!
I'm Monica's maid of honor. Okay? Don't try to blue pin me!
Oooohh that's interesting.
Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?
What were you thinking?!
No, I'm not.
Oh my God Ross! What in heaven's name are you doing here?
Monica! Stop it!
Yeah, like a chimney.
Yeah.
What?
What are you shushing?
Oh no-no-no don't say but! No-no, but's never good! Let's just leave it at, you like me and I like you.
Oh, y'know what, I didn't want cinnamon on this.
What? Wait a minute, I didn't pay, I thought you paid!
This one is uh Paul O'Neil.
Happy birthday.
Oh, right, that's me!
Two, two babies?
Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking. This is actually the smell of success.
Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants she's always wanted!
Wow, that's great Ross, I'm sorry we weren't more supportive before.
Are you kidding?!
Stop picturing it!!
Ohhh!!!
Oh yeah, I got a cat.
No-no! Don't dance for me! Please? Don't! What is the matter with you guys?
Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?
What?
Oh my God!! Do it!! Honey, you've waited long enough!!
What, so you go over there, you tell him you think he's cute, what's the worst that could happen?
Okay. Okay.
What's up?!
What?! She made the tea!
No.
Hey!
Good! 'Cause I've got a product report to read, it's like eight pages, I hope I don't fall asleep.
Umm, listen, I'm gonna need to take a rain check, my roommate is just really sick. Okay? Bye! Honey, listen, I know, I know things seem so bad right now.
Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was in love with you!
I know!
Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody. Woo!
Oh no! Yes! Of course, I know that! I just-I meant y'know are you still a 'We' or are you just 'You?'
Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from Fame. Ready to go to the movies?
Eh. Beth dies.
That cute waiter guy from your restaurant, the one that looks like a non-threatening Ray Liotta?
Okay, you're right. You're right. You can't help me.
I got the job!
Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone.
Hey, how'd the interview go?
No!
Oh, Ross, relax. It's probably like two dollars for the first contraction, and then fifty cents for each additional contraction.
Really?! You think so? Y'know, I had just rolled out of bed.
Men are unbelievable.
So, I love you.
Oh yes, it's me! Sorry!
No.
Fine! I judged you. I made a snap judgement. But you did it too! And you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! You can't even open up your mind for a second to see if you're wrong! What does that say about you?
No, the other thing. I really think it's great they work things out.
Hi.
So do you uh, think we can get you one of those uh, uniform things?
What?
Okay uh, but before you do that. I-I, I need you to talk to me.
Here we go. I'm serving my last cup of coffee. There you go. Enjoy.
What? Hey! No-no-no! This not cool! You don't even know me!
Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn't give us the right to erase his message!
Yeah! Especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around...
What!?
Hey-hey! Oh, look at you, all sexy.
Oh honey thank God you're home, I was getting worried.
I love him. He's so pretty I wanna cry! I don't know what to do. Tell me what to do.
Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean, what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats?
Wha...
If we broke up, and I lost you...
A cyborg?! Isn't that like a robot?!
And I still have about five seconds to spare. Okay, that was about seven seconds.
Well, y'know, sometimes that helps.
Oh, I'm sorry. You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you. I mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy. What? What do you want? Do you want my blessing?
Yeah, fair enough.
Oh, I'm sorry I spoiled you're evening.
Ooh, let's open them!
You went shopping?! What, and then you just came in here and paraded it right under Jill's nose when you know she's trying to quit. Wow, you guys are terrible!
I don't even know how I would go about it.
Yes!
Hey, who's this little naked guy?
What?
What?
Ooh, I was soo nervous about that letter. But the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you've grown. Y'know?
Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be...
Ohh! Thank God! Where was it?
Ha!
Oh wow. That-y'know what? That is so unfair. Y'know what? Now I want to steal your thunder! Come on Ross, let's go have sex!
I think he's stealing from me.
All right. All right, all right, all right, all right, I know it's stupid! I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it!
There he is!
Yeah. A year ago..
Yeah.
Oh.
Okay. Wait! Wait!
That's all right.
Oh good God! I've fallen down!
Full house.
It's Le Poo.
Ooooh, that's fine. We'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy.
Yeah.
HI!! Hi!
Phoebe, if this guy's going through a divorce, is it such a good idea to start going out with him?
So, whaddya think George is like?
Whoops. Oh, hey, do you need help with that?
This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself reaching for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. You want her back you have to start acting aloof.
Um, Barry.
Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anyway-umm, what is this book about?
Oh please, what do you know! You married a lesbian!
Well, I'll ask him for you, if you want me too?
Hi.
That's a line from the show too!
Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
So....
Oh well, too late, sorry, you already had some.
It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.
We are looking at a Playboy.
God, oh God Monica, I forgot. This is our first date.
Oh Ross, hi! Hey, how are ya? There you are!
That's not Ross!
Oh, I blew it. I wouldn't of even hired me.
Okay, here we go. I'm Jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird look on your face. What? Honey, what is it? Did I get it wrong? Did I get the hair wrong? What? Did you just picture it differently? What? What?
God I know, you're right.
Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?!
You bought boobs?
I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.
Oh my God!
Thank you.
Hi!
Yeah that's great Paul, but y'know I wanna know what--Wow, those are really great! I just wanna know what, what is behind this-this strong, silent exterior. Y'know they say that still waters run deep and I wanna swim in yours.
Oh, y'know Joey, you are sick!
Well in High School, that added up to head cheerleader.
Hi!
All right, bye-bye.
Ooh, goooosh, ooh, these are cookies smashed in the sports section.
Yeah?
Music. Very nice.
You don't want to work for a guy like that.
Let me get my coat.
Monica, what should I do?
All right, you know what? This isn't funny anymore. There's something about me on that piece of paper and I want to see it.
Oh Ross, you're so great.
Oh. Right.
But....
Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.
Oh they're pushing! They're pushing!!
Be-because the last one was such a big seller?
Hi.
Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it.
I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry!
Yeah.
Oh, you-you mean your earrings?
Not unless different means the same.
Fourth gear!!
What?!
"Oh my God, I can't find a boyfriend! So I guess I'll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!"
And now, y'know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so..
Yes?!
Well not when they find out you slept with Jason Hurley an hour after he broke up with Monica.
I'm unpacking!
Ahhh! Ooh, nice!
'Gone for more jars. Back later. Monica Geller.'
I mean, this is unbelievable.
Do you?
Okay.
Oh my God, honey that's great.
Every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother.
Really?
Well forget it, I'm not telling that girl anything. That is not my responsibility.
Well that was umm...Okay.
What are you doing here?
I can't believe they've been together for three years.
Hi, this is my friend Rachel.
Ok, he's goin' to get my coat. He's goin' to get my coat. Oh my god, you guys. I can't believe this. This is unbelievable. What's that?
Guys! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what!
Uh, well, I think, I think he broke up with me.
Yeah! Y'know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, I have wondered whether I made the right choice. And now I know.
Monica's making jam.
OK, you wanna play? OK, let's play, let's play.
Oh, I'm sorry what?
Oh, I am sorry...
Oh, I can't believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers.
Phoebe, I'm going to Ross's wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable. Not because, I'm still in love with him! I mean, hey, y'know, I like Ross as much as the next guy, y'know? Clearly I have feelings for him, but feelings don't mean love! I mean, I still have loving feelings for Ross. Yeah! But, I have, I have continuing feelings of love, but that doesn't mean that-that I'm still in love with him. Y'know? I-I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love him-Ohh! Oh my God! Oh my-why didn't you tell me?!!
Allison's birthday party.
Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.
Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger.
Yeah.
Well then honey, buy the lamp! Hey, we have that 60 bucks from Ross.
Oh I don't know honey. It's gonna be really late.
Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?
Well, y'know what though you guys? I really appreciate that but I think I'm just gonna take Sebastian to the charity.
All right, come on, let's go get your coat.
Oh no. No Ross, don't do this.
Oh, right! Wait a minute, I do that too.
Okay, oh, here's what you do. Just act like everything around you turns you on.
Ben, its Rachel! But whatever.
Oh honey, I'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're cuddlily sleepers. Okay, I'm late for work.
Oh-oh, you lie.
Like a little girl. I know. I know. I know. This is all my fault; I wanted him to open up. But God, I didn't know that I was gonna unleash this-this weepy, clingy, moist monster!
How come you are?!
I'm not going to sleep with Ralph Lauren. I mean, I could, but I wouldn't.
OK, that's dead right?
Oh no, I know that. I know that. Although, we made a joke that we spend so much time together he should call me his work wife.
It's not a big deal!
Would you like to go to a basketball game with me? You know, its funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets too... Umm, who likes the Knicks-
Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica's photo albums, I mean you don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks.
I have one.
Well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what, you're fired.
Hi! All right, let's go shoppin'!!
Ya know, Dr. Burke kissed me once.
Yeah, ohh! Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth? I have a crush on you; I am attracted to you. Gee, I-I know that I freaked him out
I think it's sexy.
Hey!
It is? Really?
Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!
Ohh, it's gonna be so great! I'm gonna get to help decide what we sell, I'm gonna have an office with walls and everything. I'm gonna have walls!
Oh Ross, would you stop, you got me, I'm dating you.
There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course.
Oh yeah surfer?
No.
So why don't you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?
Ok, Chandler, Mon, there's only one bananna nut muffin left.
Ha! See, I knew, I knew you'd get it on the first guess. Isn't it cool! It's an apothecary table.
I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me.
Chip! Hi, it's Rachel. Rachel Green. Yeah, umm, you left me a message. Yes you did, my roommate wrote it down. Monica Geller. Ohh.
But what about Phoebe?
You didn't get it?
Well I-I think your wrong.
Okay!
Yes I am!
I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...
We're good?
Anyway sweetie, I am, I'm so sorry I ruined your night.
Joey has got a secret peephole!
No?
Maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there.
Well, my eye is a little itchy.
Yeah, I-I don't care.
Hi, it's me. I've been trying to reach you all night. I feel awful. Please, Ross, you gotta know there is nothing between me and Mark. This whole break-up thing is just stupid.
Ooh, it was only okay.
Oh my God! Oh my God!! Ohh, Jessica Lockhart!! In my apartment!! I am such a huge fan! I am such a huge fan!
No, I-I just don't know how you decide who to hire. I mean I've got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot of experience and then there's this guy...
I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him.
Oh, this is just terrible.
Yeah, who's gonna eat all our food, and tie up our phone lines, and - is that my bra? What the hell you doin' with my bra?
Hey Joey, what 'cha doing?
Oh, yeah, well hey, welcome to our sauna.
Oh yeah? Startin' to feel her again there are we?
What?!
Ross, things aren't gonna be weird between us, right? I mean was that just the stupidest thing, me telling you that?
Oh, she wants to see me tomorrow...Oh, she sounded really weird, I gotta call Barry... Hi, it's me, I just.. Mindy!! Mindy! Hi! No, I figured that's where you'd be!
Hey Phoebs, whatcha got there?
I just, I feel, I-I just...
Wait a minute! You let Ross drive the Porsche and when I ask you, you say you're the only one who's allowed to drive it.
Oh God! Y'know what I wish? I wish you were six years older. Well actually, if I'm wishin' for stuff, I actually wish I was six years younger.
So, did you shave your legs?
Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?
Hi!
Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and everything is changing.
Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.
Hey you.
Okay! All right! How was she?
Um, excuse me, everyone. Ah, this is my last night working here, and I ah, just wanted say that I made some really good friends working here, and ah, it's just time to move on. Ah, and no offence to everybody who ah, still works here, you have no idea how good it feels to say that as of this moment I will never have to make coffee again.
Well, we never actually got to dinner.
You idiot!!
I know. I'm sorry.
Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!
Ooh, ooh, ooh,ooh,ooh. Hi.
Okay.
Monica. You've, you've done it right?
Uh, Joey..
What? What!?! You kissed him?
Well, yeah, this is the deal.
Good day for married people huh?
Oh, ah nothin'. I just felt like hangin' out here and reading.
Oh, making it worse!
It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling... Wow! My whole mouth just filled with saliva!
Oh as, as opposed to your other multi-functional nipples?
Huh.
..You're, you're 'mah mah mah' what?
No! Ross, no! It is not fine! Eh-eh-according to my plan I should already be with the guy I wanna marry!
The ring from the cave, yeah.
Uh-huh.
Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later.
So honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl?
Yeah.
Hi!
I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.
Thank you. So are we good?
Look at you, you are so big I can't believe it!
Honey, y'know I just gotta tell you, I think this is such a terrific thing you're having these babies for Frank and Alice.
What?!
All right. Hey-hey-hey!! Sandwiches!
Oh, come on, would you just grab my ass.
Oh my goodness, she had the smoothest skin! I mean when I stuck that dollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thigh...
HEY!! Do you have to do that? It's Saturday!
Ohhh, I-I would enjoy that!
I don't think he's the one who needs help.
Oh my God! Phoebe look, it's Ross and that girl.
No, she had to have just taken that test because I took out the trash last night.
Well sure, if you say you're gonna take care of everything I have no reason to doubt you. Give me those forms! All right, now I'm gonna do this my way and I don't want to hear a peep out of you!
What?! No! I'm not gonna move out!
What the hell is that?
The nights are the hardest. But then the day comes! And that's every bit as hard as the night. And then the night comes again...
I've got some bad news.
Okay.
Well, y'know I-I don't know where he is.
You what?
I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that.
Oh.... my God.
Ohh, thank you.
Thank you. Oww!!!! God!
Oh, okay. Will you take my place?
You don't pick me! You're stuck with me!
No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look. See look, men, carrying the bag.
Oh... Oh, Pheebs.
Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta... OK, I'll see you later.
No, she left a message. But it-it kinda got erased. There's just something wrong with your machine.
That's all right. I mean hard is it to get a couple drinks right, huh?
Ohh!
Yeah and we'll drop it off downstairs so that we're not tempted.
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. See Phoebe, Phoebe.
Uh, I'm just, I'm just looking out your window. At-at the view. What are you guys doing?
...Jack from downstairs?
Oh. Here's your moisturiser. Hi!
I can not believe your trading me!!
Relaxi-Taxi!
What's the matter?
You're kidding.
I did not sell you out.
God!
And I'm in it? Then let me read it.
OK, sorry to break up this party, but I've got resumes to fax before work tomorrow...
No, really. Really, Pheebs, you're not gonna be the one worrying about saving for college, or yelling at them when they're bad, y'know, or deciding to put them on Ritalin when they just won't calm down. Y'know?
Oh!
Well, Chandler, you're gonna have to tell him.
Well said. And a uh good example of the fun I was referring to uhh, but I just think I'm past the point where I think I can y'know, just have fun.
Oh, okay.
Ow!
Well, do you want to hear what actually happened or Joey's lewd version?
I don't get this! She was horrible!
No, no no no, don't need to know the details.
Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending Thanksgiving with her.
Yeah! But I don't know what he looks like!
Wow you, you. I had no idea.
OK, then get me your purse.
As are you...
Hi you. I can't believe I'm waking up next to you.
Uh-huh.
Isn't that a kind of sushi?
So, how are you?
Really?
That's right, I wanna do it with you! I've been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things.
Daddy, daddy, you know what, I really wanna hear more about this, I really do, but I just have, I just have to do a, some stuff.
Oh, what are you going to do?! Are you gonna go run tell Monica?! Are you gonna tell Joey?! No! Because then you will have to tell them what we did! We are desert stealers! We are living outside the law!
Oh, Ross, I'm sorry. I completely ruined your evening.
You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.
Ya think?
Oh my God!
Done.
Because!
Good.
Wow! I mean I had no idea that that was gonna...
What?!
Okay?
Is Monica here?
Only 'cause you took up half the circle.
Ooh, so cute, that I'm thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.
Wo-women? You mean like old women?
No, I did, but tell me again, because it's so romantic.
Look, I am so...so happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that I'm not. I'm not even close. And I don't know, maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that that's dumb, but oh my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!
No? Y'know, I can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue.
Hey! Hi!
Great! Monica's moving!
Ooh! Y'know what? If we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour.
Hi.
Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!
What?
I'm off my break now so uh, um here you take this and um, I am gonna go pour these very nice people some coffee. Ok. Oh look at that, I don't have a pot. I don't have a pot. Well, hey, maybe I've got one at home, or in Scarsdale. Hey is that a door?
Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you.
Bye. Ahhh... So this is fun, huh?
Ohhhhh. That's how it got fixed!
Look Ross, if you're so freaked out, just get in the car!
Down at the docks again?
Man! He just keeps lobbing them up and I just keep knocking them right out of the park!
I have the best job in the entire world! The most adorable guy came over today, and I got to dress him up all day!
What do you think Monica mean when she said she didn't want to talk, especially with me? I mean, why not especially you and me? We were both out there kissing.
Oh! Well, um.. You've got plugs!
I can make you a legend. I can make you this generation's Milton Berle.
All right, wherever you wanna go is cool.
I'll help you throw out your purse.
Oh, time's up.
Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.
Wow!!
Well, there was a disaster in shipping and I've got to get this order in. Honey, I'm so sorry, but it looks like I'm gonna be here all night.
Yeah...
He's not 11!
Well?
More than jewelry.
Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up!
Wow, I am so glad I'm not Monica right now.
Hey, umm, can I ask you guys something?
Why, does she have a bad personality?
Yeah, Monica's settin' me up.
Y'know what? No. It's not over until someone says, "I do."
Thanks for lunch, Chandler. Y'know, you didn't have to walk me all the way back up here.
Yeah.
Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but we're gonna have to get into Mr. Zelner's office. Now, he doesn't get in until 10, so he's no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.
Really?
What?
Well, what'm I gonna do? What'm I gonna do?
Oh my God!!! Ross!!
Oh, wait yes, but I can't eat too much. Paul is taking me out to dinner tonight, he said he has a big surprise planned.
Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.
You don't know?!
What's up?
No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.
Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it!
Yeah, Phoebe you're... awful!
Ohh, yeah, well I wanted to give Emily a big American good-bye cheer. So okay! Ready! Okay! Gimme an 'E!'
That wouldn't help me.
Oh Phoebe!
Oh!
What?
It's not random, it's Bob.
What are you ever gonna use that for?!
Bye Mon.
Huh, Bob Saget?
Ohh, Phoebe, what am I going to do?
No Phoebe! You cannot get the phone that way; that's not fair! Okay look, I have an idea. Why don't we, why don't we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. And then whoever does gets the phone.
Cappuccino.
Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?
Is my hook unhooked? These things keep falling down, I can't. . .
Chandler, relax, Chandler, she'll be here.
Yeah sure, iced tea would be great.
I found him! Very funny, come here! That is exactly why I've come here to talk to you okay?
What? What?!
Ah, hah-hah-hah-ho, yeah, he wishes. Oh, I'm sorry, look at me. OK, Michael, let's talk about you.
We're sorry.
Oh that's all right! Y'know, I ended up having a really good time. Y'know, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness.
Okay.
That's crazy! You can't do that! What are you going to tell her? Oh God. Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you?
Say it!
You know, actually it's more like, hi.
Oh God! This is silly, I'm gonna see you in a couple of hours!
No, there's nothing to make up, she's gonna know that I have a key to her office, I've got to get you locked up back the way you were!
I'm training to be better at a job that I hate, my life officially sucks.
Who wrote it?
Grammy, Best New Artist.
Hi!
Oh! That's fine.
Hi Russ, I've just got two more tables to clean and then we'll go, OK?
That is so cool.
Do what, do what?
Oh hi, Mr. Wineburg, hi Mrs. Wineburg.
What? Oh my God! I'm gonna miss you so much!
Oh. Oh! I can do it!
Oh! Did you hear that?! My dad's proud of me! My dad's proud of me.
Guess what?
Oh, uh, Joanna I was wondering if I could ask you something. There's an opening for an assistant buyer in Junior Miss...
No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.
Phoebe, your in pain, would you just go to the dentist, just go.
Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that I don't get.
Oh, that's sweet.
Are you serious?
Oh, but he was my pig man...how did I not see this?
Joey, you can't keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him.
Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.
Yes I do, it's just that Ross is. . .
Great!
Oh hey-hey wait! How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?
Yeah, sure?
Okay, I'll see you after the thing.
Yes!
Okay, I'm totally cool!
Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?
Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark?
No! Come on! Don't make me go long. Use me. They never cover me.
Okay.
Who is it?
Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister's mouth long enough to tell me that.
I can't! It's too late! Terry already hired that girl over there. Look at her, she's even got waitress experience. Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin.... swans.
Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship!!
Yeah, when I was in the bathroom I saw the window that I crawled out of at my wedding, and God, I just started thinking that I shouldn't be here, you know I shouldn't, people are going to be looking at me and judging me and, and thinking about the last time.
Maybe it, maybe it doesn't have to be this tough. I mean, maybe you were on the right track with this whole, you know, spontaneous thing. I mean, women really like that.
Why's that?
Impressive.
You were gonna drink the fat.
No! You gotta hold my hand!!
Okay, you know what? I don't have it, but I can tell you exactly where it is on my night stand, and...okay. But you know what? I have my drivers license and I have a twenty.
Ok Ross, just so you know, calling it a poopie diaper doesn't make this process any cuter.
Okay!
Yes!
You let Joey drive it?!
Monica what?
I can't believe it! He still hasn't called.
No!
Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend!
All right!
Ross, please, I found the magazines!
Hey.
So I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out. It's just so frustrating!
... the WENUS?
Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?
Pheebs? Could you get that? Please?
Hi! I got you some coffee. To, uh... ...fair enough. So! Do you got anything for me?
Yeah. You're not gonna end up alone.
Then, we had this big, stupid fight, and I said I wanted to take a break, I don't want to take a break.
Well, can I talk to you for a sec?
Why not?
Okay. Oh, uh, wait a minute, y'know what? I uh, I can't decide this. Umm, okay, just hold on a second.
Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.
Oh that's okay.
Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
I meant, me plus one!
No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? Are people eating my dip?
Oh!
Y'know what Ross? You're not going anywhere. You're gonna sit right here. I'm gonna make you a cup of tea and we're gonna talk this thing whole out. All right? Hey, Dave!
Ah.
Joey, do you have a minute?
Thanks.
All right.
Yeah Pheebs, honey, she just got engaged a couple of hours ago. I doubt she's even had time to...
Well, you were pretty damn good.
I cannot believe you.
Okay! Y'know what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three kids...
I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night.
Just a job!
So how's it goin' with Joey?
Where ya going?
Like what?
OK, OK, that is my favorite sweater, that is my third date sweater.
Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about you...
Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me! I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless. You just saved me! You're my hero!
I knew.
Yeah!
I thought this might happen today. Ross, I know the holidays can be rough. Y'know? And it's probably really hard for you to be alone right now.
Oh my God Phoebe! I mean I'm just-Wait a minute. If I'm your maid of honor that means you are Monica's.
You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15!! It doesn't even fit you anymore!
I'm sorry. All right, I'll just stay in here this time. Okay.
Oh, I read that in high school.
Ross, you are so pathetic. Why can't your son just play with his doll?
Just one drink?!
But I haven't used my card in weeks!
I can't believe you don't want to know. I mean, I couldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows....
No. I have got to get ready and go to a dinner at my bosses house. It's a very big deal, there's a lot of people there I have to meet.
Hey, so did everything go okay with the annulment?
Is he okay in there?
Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight. It's been kinda a long day.
I did!
Thanks!
Ross, didn't you ah, play soccer in High School? Oh no wait, that's right. You just organized their game schedules on your Commodore 64.
Oh my God! How?!
You want me to just call him up and tell him that you're seeing him instead? That's what you want?
Okay, well, that's one less thing we have to do on Monday.
Oh it's umm, it's tofu cake. Do you want some?
What?
Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine.
What?
Okay. Okay.
Okay, here we go...
Yeah, okay, at ease solider!
Because it's Richard's son! It's like inviting Greek tragedy over for dinner!
All right, fine, but don't get mad at me. It's-it's just a little hard to believe.
I mean maybe you didn't hear about a serious relationship called me and Joshua?
Oh, God.
Yeah-eah-ha!
Hey.
Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to Ross's wedding.
Uh-huh.
Yeah! It's an apothecary table. Does anyone even know what an apothecary is?
No, of course, of course I've heard of them! Ross, what did you get?
You have! Ross, you should give yourself credit. I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, "Once a cheater, always a cheater."
Yes.
I'm just sort of in the middle of something.
Okay, you guys, just relax. I doooo.
Yeah, what's it about?
I don't know, y'know? I feel a little umm... No, y'know what? Nevermind, I'm gonna be fine.
Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be there.
Umm... I'm never gonna getting married!
Yeah!
Oh well, it's kinda lonely up there, so I just thought I would come out here and get some fresh air.
What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it.
I haven't seen him in so long!
It's OK, it's fine.
Why would a charity give away a free boat?!
OK Julie, so now let's start with your childhood, what was that like?
It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job.
Oh-ho!
Yeah?
What?!!
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha.
Oh no-no, no-no, they don't want you to put your hands in the pockets until you are out of the store.
Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.
Why, why not?
Yes you do. You think of it as your apartment, and I'm just somebody who rents a room.
Honey, that's you're name.
Me either. Umm, all right, first thing I need you to do is go downstairs and find a women named Hilda and tell her to go home.
Oh God. I'm sorry about this.
Y'know, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants? Tag! I'm serious! This isn't funny! Those contracts absolutely had to go out today!
Okay.
Well?
14?
Ok, ok, ok, I will, I will, I, hey, I will clean the apartment for two months.
Oh, Phoebe, are you still on hold? I was supposed to call my Dad back like two hours ago.
Yeah?
No.
Oh, hey!
Ohh, what is in that?
Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?
Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three choruses of "You'll never make it on your own".
It's not! I'm defrosting a chicken. Oh, I uh sold Mrs. Whiskerson.
Blow it.
Ross, what's the matter?
Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?
Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming. He's coming. Hey, what's up?
No. I...
Ahh. Thank you!
Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.
No, no, thats OK. Y'know, I think I'm gonna give it a go.
Wow, so why don't you go talk to him?
Yeah. Yeah. Definitely, well it definitely took me by surprise, but I'm okay.
OK, well, bye-bye again.
Okay Joey, we're luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham?
I don't know. The left one.
We're just really...very excited about this charity event that we have to go to.
Oh God, Phoebe!
Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Did I miss it? Did I miss it?
No! Forget it! I am not gonna ask Frank to give you one of his kids!!
That would be great! Wait, how long is Denise gone for?
Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now! Oh, thank you!
Oh I'm sorry, we're clo-... Hey sailor.
Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.
I really do.
Right!
Boy, you really can't stand to lose, can you? Your whole face is getting red... little veins popping out on your temple...
Alright, I got it Ross.
What?
So Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
What's the matter?
Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!
Yeah!
There was a woman at the... The stripper?!
Look at it, isn't it beautiful?
No, it was a stupid bet! We were just playing a game!
Sure! God, please take those off!
Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought.
All right. We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup offer.
I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great.
Well, well, you said it was practice!
Ross, would you just stop it! It's getting really old.
Yeah! I've been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat.
Hey.
You know what?
Hey guys! What's up?
Nobody.
Of course I clean it. I mean, I,I will cleeeean it. I mean, I will cleeeean it.
Oh my God.
What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?
I did.
Hi!
Okay.
I can't believe Mark didn't call. It's Sunday night, and he didn't call.
Where's Chip, why isn't he here yet?
Hey.
Yeah, I love that story. Um, I got a question for you guys. Why do people keep is saying that is good to see me up and about?
OK.
That's great!
Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.
Huh. Does Monica know about this?
Well, isnt, isnt that gonna be weird?
It's Joshua.
Yes! Totally!
"Indeed there isn't"... I should really get back to work.
Wait, we still have time to talk and they're-they're not even in the car yet! Oh look, there they go, okay.
So, he's on the show, he knows what happens.
Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right. I love you, but you're crazy.
What, what's it, what's going on?
Oh really?!
Oh my God! Oh, I cannot believe it!
Well, she-she ob-obviously saw the tire tracks that were leading up to the closed garage.
A mistake?! What were you trying to put it in? Her purse?!
Hi.
Oh wow! This is so cool.
Oh, it's so much more fun with you.
Oh honey, are you jealous of Paolo? Oh, c'mon, I'm so much happier with you than I ever was with him.
Oh no, yeah.
You?
Something to do with numbers?
Y'know, I gotta tell ya, this really does put in a better mood.
Y'know what? Fine, I don't care. Don't believe me, I know I'm right-do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?
Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?
Uhh, I mean this is like reading about my own life. I mean this book could have been called 'Be Your Own Windkeeper Rachel'.
Hi! Hi Ben!
Do you know something?
It's not here Pheebs, it's not here. Ohh, I went to Joey and Chandler's last night! Okay!
No, yeah, Ive done that.
I mean n-not-not fake at all like most famous people.
I'm so sorry! Are you okay?
What?
I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!
You fell asleep?!
I would love to!
Yeah! Closure. That's what it is, that's what I need. God, you're brilliant! Why didn't I think of that? How do I get that?
Okay. Let's use this brush.
What?! We can't do that!
Okay. Are you sure you wanna hear this?
OK, here we go. Honey, I'm sorry, they were all out of apple pie, someone just got the last piece.
No, you know what, it's late, everything's gonna be closed. Why don't we just do it another night?
With Ross and my sister?
Is that the heartbeat?
Thank you. Hello? I still don't get it.
Phoebe, I thought your dad was in prison.
No!!
Umm, can I use your bathroom?
Yes. You're not asking are you?
It's a truffle. It's got all of these layers. First there's a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch, then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sauteed with peas and onions, then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!
Well, I was gonna let you play with it.
How about you guys?
All right.
Well, I-I'm startin' too.
Oh, come on! This is crazy! Can't we just flip a coin?!
Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's picture! This is so exciting!
You have a son!
Well, they always called.
No, no, no, now wait, wa, wa, waa-it a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. That actually, uh, that sounds interesting.
Well, I have a job interview at Ralph Lauren tomorrow!
Why, where are you going?
Yeah I know, and I bet you thought it would be weird. But it's not!
Joey!
Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol.
Alright, somebody.
Hello? Like he was really gonna send you one? She was a big girl.
Oh, no, Michael, it's not you. I'm sorry, it's just, it's this thing. It's probably not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is, is getting a cat with his girlfriend.
Can I see you in my office for a minute?
Yeah! Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started putting some stuff together, y'know just in case...
Okay. Uh, want something-want something to drink?
I use my breasts to get other people's attention.
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait.
Okay, see now, what I just heard, blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah, blah.
Y'know Marcel?
Well, it gets worse. When asked if you take initiative I wrote, "Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision," and under Problems with Performance I wrote, "Dear God, I hope not," and then uh, then I drew a little smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch.
Oh?
No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to figure out what I want
Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here!
Right.
Hi, welcome to our tropical Christmas party. You can put your coats and sweaters and pants and shirts in the bedroom.
Okay.
Okay!
Yeah fun? Great! So uh, so did you guys hit it off?
Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.
Okay! Here we go! Okay! Hi, Joey! It's Rachel! Umm, I am free tomorrow night. Yeah, sure, sure I can bring some sandwiches.
Well, I didn't know what else to do!
I-Ohh!
You know what?
All right, let's go!
On TV?! Yeah!
Yeah, we could. Oh hey look! There's some Kappa Kappa Deltas! I was a Kappa. Hey sisters! Wow, we really are bitches.
No, I think it's very obvious who's wrong here.
Okay.
Yeah! Right! Okay, I'll see you guys later. Woo hoo!
Yeah.
Hey! Y'know what? You are in our apartment all the time! Okay? This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!
Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just loved your look when you were bald.
Ra.... Er.. Barbra.
What?! What? What happened?!
Ross, I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City.
Oh my god, I can't believe you let me put this in my mouth.
Isn't it incredible?! Monica and Chandler, gettin' married.
Oh, well, you know, they're just separated so, you know, never know, we'll see.
Hi.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Umm, maybe you can start with, "Chandler, even though we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more."
That is neither here nor there.
No, actually first they started on my waist. And then, they slid up, and then, they were in my hair.
Terry is a jerk, ok? That's why we're always saying "Terry's a jerk!" That's where that came from.
Hey roomie!
Oh Ross, you're so great.
And thank you for your time.
At his apartment. Is this juice?
Okay. Okay. Joey, it's okay. Settle down.
Okay you're right. I'll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect for the job Hilda!
Now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah, who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and I think that's a big mistake and here's why. I made a huge fool of myself and I came back, that shows courage. When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no. That shows integrity. And, I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage. Okay umm, now I know I already said courage, but y'know you gotta have courage. And umm, and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace, I said no and I was not litigious. {By the way, litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against. So she didn't want to sue him. Don't worry, I had to look it up too.} So there you go, you got, you got courage, you got integrity, you got courage again, and not litigious. Look Mr...
Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
No, we never do that
I don't know, I don't know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break.
Y'know what? I don't, I don't think Phoebe really wants to come.
Well umm...
It's not dumb. But, maybe it's okay that you're not a part of it. Y'know what I mean? I mean it's like, I-I-I like that you're not involved in that part of my life.
What was that?!
No I wasn't! You were supposed to tell her to come and I was supposed to bring the cake!
Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!!
Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.
Really?!
Oh, thank you.
Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!
Ross look, look this is good for you. Okay? Let's face it, so far the guy's not lovin' ya! But I can turn that around! I got the inside track! We can all go out to dinner, y'know? And I can talk you up! Ross, the guy is a very, very successful lawyer!
Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just share too much?
But honey, I think she's moving in with Chandler.
Okay. I'll miss you.
I didn't know you could get married here.
Surprise...
I'm not gonna tell you, but if you found out on your own, that would be okay and then we could talk about it. Right?
I mean, y'know I'm just gonna have to accept it ...
Oh.
Really? How good?
You-you're not wearing a jacket.
Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you.
Yes, Joey, I remember, she's annoying, but you know what she's-she's his girlfriend now. I mean what can we do?
Okay, uhh, I think I'm going to run to the ladies room.
Okay, Pheebs, y'know what, let's look at this objectively all right? Ninth grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So then...
No no no no no. You wanted me to take them down, so... ..Im takin em down. Okay? Whoa!
Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house.
What you got there? Something else that's not yours that you can break?
yeah-yeah-yeah!!
Chandler!! Are you gonna call her!
Hey! What's up Mon?
So that there will be a decent place for me to sit.
No.
Okay well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute!
Yeah, I-I heard. I think it's great! Ohh, I'm so happy for you!
What?!
That is not a tattoo, that is a nothing. I finally got her back in the chair, bairly touched her with a needle, she jumped up screaming, and that was it.
Wait a minute! Why don't you guys do something?!
Yeah, you should, really.
Thank you! You're great!
Umm, well let's see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw.
Hey, wait a minute! That is my sock!
'Kay.
That's just great.
Yes, so close. Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an emotional and difficult time, for all of us. But by any chance did Joanna send any paperwork your way before... it happened.
Who got married?!
You got fired?!
Well, Ross said my name.
Phoebe?
Yes!!
I know, I remember that!
What's your problem?
Hey you!
Okay, just sweep it.
Oh, wait-wait-wait...
Here?! Now?!
Noo way, Kevin.
Ooh, I just wish we hadn't lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...
You said she was bald!!
Sorry, I thought you were talking to me.
We'll take Literature!!
I dumped him.
What?
No-no, I'm staying put.
Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee? Oh, look at that.
Wow! This is great! Look at all these cups! This is so weird.
Joey.
Oh my God! I can't believe you guys are actually think you're moving in here!
What're you guys doing out here?
Uh-huh!
Well thank you, you too.
Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you're, you're, you're making this too hard.
Why the hell didn't you tell me!
Okay..Okay.. Look. I'm sorry that I lied to you before. You were right. Ralph and I were an item but were not anymore.
Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn't go with Mark?
Yeah, well that's how mad I am!!
Ross, I don't, I just don't think it's going to fit.
Well Phoebe, we gotta do something! Well, y'know. I mean there's no way Joey's gonna make it in time. So I'm gonna through the hotel and see if there's any other weddings going on.
Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.
You can't, because of the new skylight!
Yeah that's right you weren't thinking! Y'know what? Let me give you something to think about!
Yeah honey you don't believe her do you?
Oh no, at the Grammies I always win.
Oohhh.
I guess you weren't there.
I uh, I have two tickets to the Knicks game tonight if you're interested, just as a thank you for this week.
Yeah, I know... ..I'm I'm just not that bright either.
Joey, come on! We just went over this!
What's that song? It has been in my head all day long.
Really?!
And the chicken pooped in her lap. Oh, I'm so sorry. I just gave away the ending, didn't I? Oh! It's just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I can think about.
Well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married?
Oh no-no-no, no-no-no, that's not what I meant.
But ah, you're safe from it if it's in the freezer?
Really? You think so?
Honey, listen, y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful.
I will wake you up in a way that's proved very popular in the past.
Thank God.
Yeah, when we're in the audience he doesn't talk to us, but he does wave.
It-it did!
Hi you guys.
Well. Woah, look at that! I gotta go, I gotta date. With a man. Um, OK, you guys have a really, uh, have a really good night and you two have a, uh, have a, uh, really good cat. OK, we're not supposed to take these when we leave.
Ross, get over it! It's not like she hates you.
Hey!
Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried...
Okay. Well that's pretty much all that we have-Oh! Oh! Have you ever had a virgin margarita?
Well y'know, we have 7 people and like 10 pizzas, what do you think?
No, I knew.
No?
Eh, I'm just so sorry I put you through it. And, I y'know, I don't want to get back together over a machine.
Why?
Ohhhh, come on!!!
Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.
Hi! Thanks, hey so uh what'd you do last night?
Oh, little 'X's! Great! That makes up for everything!
Oh, come on! He's glad that I came, he doesn't want me to go anywhere, balls flying all over the place!
Well maybe he saw your hand slip briefly from the ten and two o'clock position.
He-he said Rachel, right? Do you think I should go up there?
And y'know what, I'm gonna, I'm gonna go to bed now, but ah, on my way to work tomorrow morning, I'm gonna stop by around 8:30.
Oh, there you are! Hi! Oh, so, so, how was China, you?
Oh hi!
What?
Oh good.
Well, can I keep the presents and still be 29?
So now what have we agreed?
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry, it's just that when you moved your hands down to my butt, it was like woah, Ross's hands are on my butt. Sorry.
Oh, honey that's awful.
Oh. Right. ...Oh great.
What? Wh-hey!
And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!
Oh, yeah, well... Yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyin' around the house.
Ok, we never shoulda talked about this.
I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of...
Who?
Oh yeah! I know.
Because I'm married. That's right, I am a married woman! And I came to a TV star's apartment to have an affair! Uck!
Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?
But you-you said black. Why would he want his blue blazer black?
Phoebe! You can't do th...
Okay, I do.
I'd say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving.
Awww, no, it's okay, we've actually known for a while.
Ok.
Yeah, I'm pretty confident about that. That's what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler! It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.
What?
Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?
Sure? Thanks.
Okay come on Phoebe, it's nothing! Monica, come on!
No.
And that's Phoebe , and that's Joey.
Well what if I told you, you can do it in my apartment?
God, I'm not lame, okay. I can do something. I can throw, would you let me throw, come on this is my game too.
So, Spin The Bottle works like this I spin the bottle, it lands on Gunther, so I would have to kiss Gunther. (She crawls over to where Gunther is sitting and sees the look of anticipation on Gunther's face and decides not to kiss him.) All right. Who wants to go first?
Oh, let me see! Oh, God, is he just the sweetest thing? You must just want to kiss him all over!
We did!
Oh, can we read them?
Oh, oh, and hey-hey-hey, those little spelling tips will come in handy when you're at home on Saturday nights playing Scrabble with Monica!!
Hi.
Nooo!
Oh, good point.
So, does this come in another color or...
Oh, thank goodness!
Oh, you go out with him.
Both of them are here, both of them, both of them are here?
Hey.
I'm not mad.
I know!
Yeah, and you don't mind if I call, because you only want good things for me.
So what-what is the exhibit.
Oh my god!!
I'm going for a walk.
Show time!
Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it. I know it's in the apartment, but I definitely lost it.
No seriously! Seriously! What has happened to the sanctity of marriage?
What thing? What is this thing?
You stole them from me!!
A lover?
Well, so what does he do?
Thank God you're pretty.
Oh, Chandler that is so nice.
Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all. I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?
Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!
Oh my God!
Yeah?
Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't know what that's for.
Alright you guys, I'm takin' off my shirt.
Oh my God, its happening. It's already started. I'm Kip.
Yes! Thank you.
Ross, you're like my best friend.
Oh, hi sweetie.
Do I have my own castle?
No, why do we always have to do everything according to your time table?
Oh my God, I can't believe this is a real $20,000 check, oh this is just so exciting.
That was her idea, I just gave her a nudge.
I had one.
Hey!
...And so then I realised. All this stuff I had been doing. proposing to Joshua, lying to Ross about why I couldn't come to the wedding. Was all just a way of...
Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?
I'm fine, I'm fine.
Hello. Umm, when is your next flight to London?
What's up?
Oh yes.
Why aren't you guys at the movie?
So what's going on with you?
Oh, I called them. And when they ask me what I saw, I can be very generous or very stingy.
All right! Let's get this over with! Ugh! Ohhh! No! Look what I did! Oh, I mean, look at this mess! I mean, we're probably gonna have to clean this up! Y'know? We're gonna have to reschedule!
Oh, okay, not so weird.
How'd it go with Pete?!
Pheebs, I have to ask you...
Mon, honey, I gotta ask you something.
Your fly is open, Geller.
Yeah. Hi Mark!
MONICA!!!! MONICA!!!!
I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils.
Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.
What do you get? Emily!! Emil-Whoa!! Okay! So that's me as a cheerleader! Ta-dum!
What?
I've got magic beans. Never-never mind.
You're out of Diet Coke.
All right. Fine.
Oh no-no, no! It's good! It's all good! I-I actually work at Ralph Lauren!
Hypothetically!
Right.
I'm not telling.
Ohh, I'm gonna be on the news!
So what are you guys going to do?
Joanna, this is my friend Chandler Bing Joanna.
Hi.
Okay, that's gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest?
Oh my God! My dog died!
What?
I know, I know, I know, I know. I was just thinking about when they were there the last time, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. OK, OK, look, woah, I promise, I'm good, I'm not gonna laugh anymore. OK put your hands back there.
Uh, thank you Phoebe. Umm, well, what struck me most when reading Jane Eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time.
Okay, then y'know what? Help me! I need help! I can't do this!
Mexico?
Yes.
Oh.
Well, have fun!
Okay, I'm sorry.
Um, what- what would make you think that?
It's left sweetie, but that's okay sweetie, that's a tough one.
Here. I thought you might be cold.
...I am jealous of her?! I mean who does she think she is?! Princess Caroline?!
Hi, sweetie!
Well, someone that has his own tux, or has the ability to rent a tux.
All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?!
Turned out it was a hat.
I'm great! I'm great. I've got a great job at Bloomingdale's, have wonderful friends, and eventhough I'm not seeing anyone right now, I've never felt better about myself.
Bye!
What line?
God. You seem really, really nice.
Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right.
Uh-huh... why... do you not like them?
Oops sorry, my mistake.
Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is gay.
Okay!
Is-is he coming?
Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn't that sad? God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?
Ross, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we've been dating for six weeks.
Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.
Okay, a thousand.
Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid. Okay? Just sweep it.
Wow... Wow!
Yeah that's actually a pretty good idea.
You see, you look beautiful. For god sakes, dim the lights.
Phoebe, come on! What is the big deal? I thought this was going to be something we could do together! Y'know, I thought it would be fun!
Oh hi!
Yeah.
Well y'know if you, if you started smoking again you could've at least told me! Come on, give me one of those! What are we talking about?
How did this happen?
Oh my God! Why is he jumping on those women!
Chandler and Monica?!! Oh, this is unbelievable!! How long have you known?
I'll take a coffee. So how was your big date last night?
Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you don't have either.
What?! What?!
I think I just shipped 3,000 bras to personnel. Oh honey, I gotta go. Mark, I need you!
Uh-huh.
Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?
Wow! They really got you guys. Your T.V. The chairs.
Little village people.
Well, isn't that a good thing? You said you were sick of this.
Together.
Then why do you ask?!
Oh.
Do you want me to quit?
Sucker!
Ow!
So uh, so did anything happen? Because rumor has it you guys shut the drapes!
Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing.
Ohhhh!! ...What? What?
Julie.
All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.
I'll go with you.
Well that-y'know it's just uh, I've never done that before. Me and him alone.
Oh. Stop it!
Well I-I-I'm not moving.
Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs...
Yeah... I, uhh... I have a... I have a date.
God, I am so glad you don't have a problem with this, because if you did, I wouldn't even consider applying.
Oh great!
Ugh. Excuse me, could you give this to that guy over there? Go ahead. Thank you. Sorry. Okay, Las Vegas.
Hey, so did everything go all right with the annulment?
Good.
Ohh, you're so sweet!
Now I love you even more.
Come on you guys! Listen, if Emily knew I was here having dinner you with you she would flip out and you know it. It's okay, I really... I don't mind.
Go!!
Yeah!
Oh, but that's okay.
So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?
Thanks!
Come on, Terry, I'll even clean the cappuccino machine.
I know.
Wow! Umm, y'know, I-I would really love to, but I-I shouldn't.
Oh God, come on you guys, is this really necessary? I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want.
Hi!
Because a car backfired?
Yeah that works.
Fine! I'm sorry for your loss!
Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up?
Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out.
Hi! Okay, don't be mad at me, but I couldn't resist.
Look at her.
Joey, you can't let him get away with that. Ya know what, I'm not going to let him get away with that. I'm going to say something to him-No, I really shouldn't say anything-No, I should say something to him. Gunther, I want you to give Joey his job back. That is really not fair that you have to fire him...
Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why don't you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?
Right!
Okay.
Hey! You...can't...leave Joey! You agreed to buy that boat, all right?! That is a contract! And plus if you leave, my boss is gonna kill me!
Okay honey, you do realize she only spins like that on ice.
Oh, hi!
Bye-bye Julie.
No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge step down!
Okay, that we may be able to do.
Oh my God! That is so good!
Well of course we will help you decide! We will do anything we can to help you! Now, I would like to make a toast, to the future Mrs. Chandler Bing , my best friend, and truly one of the nicest people that...
Okay!
Oh my God!
Okay.
Ohh, God! Look at him, he's so cute. I wanna go over there, grab him, and kiss him! How can I kiss him and not letting him know that I like him?
Oh, the guys are here.
Ugh! What grandmother?
I'm just serving it.
You think you're gonna get out of this on a technicality?
I don't know why they didn't just tell us.
I don't know, it was you and a bunch of albino kids.
Oh yeah, Joey broke it. Had to get rid of it.
Nooo!
They had to reduce it because of, of my deviated septum.
Okay.
Well, Phoebe that's fine because I'm not moving.
Yes it is! It is true! I went, I went after Ross in stupid London.
Well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them?
Well, you know that my parents are out of town and Chip was going to come over...
Ohhh... I'm fine.
All right, I'll see you guys later.
Hi, sure!
Hello, Paul.
Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.
Well, you would know.
Really?
Oh.
No. A break from us.
Go-go-go-go, come on! So uh, what did you find out?
Because he's stealing from me!
Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night.
Aren't you a little cute to be a doctor?
Yeah.
Yeah, I do.
I mean that's unbelievable.
Shut up.
Hi!
Oh, that is so sweet!
What are you doing?
Now, you do realize that she's a cartoon, and way out of your league?
Thank you.
Oh yeah!
Really?!
I'm going commando, too.
Yeah, these are pretty ch-ching.
Nooo! Hello? Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much. Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really.
Huh-huh, no act--no, uhh, that, that is basil.
He's so cute! And he seems to like you so much.
Yes, I did. Thank you very much, it was excellent.
Hi!
Ohh, wait a minute, we haven't pre...
Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica's and she and Chandler had a big fight and they're not moving in.
Ye-, no, my Uncle Hi.
No no, 'cause mayo, that would make it gross.
Oh yeah, there you go.
It's a uh, regatta gala.
Yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We sort of, we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases.
All right!
Yeah, she's gay.
Are you kidding?!
That's what I said! Thank you for being so nice.
Oh God, oh, and then she told the funniest story...
Are you over me?
Really?
Ohh, not compared to you.
Okay.
Well, y'know, possibly. You didn't tell him that, though? Right?
Come on. Oh! And, uh, by the way....
Oh my God! Oh my God!! That is like the third most prestigious soap opera award there is!
You get your messages!
Ugh!
Mrs., Mrs. Gobb?
Well, wait a minute! The puss is good! It means it's healing!
You, you, you said he liked me. You, you slowpokes!
Really!?
I feel...
You're so pretty.
Oh, God...
Was that the cake?
And that's I'm so glad... there's no problem.
Good different?
Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?
And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!
Oh, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home. Be home. Be home, be home, be home. Oh, you're not home.
Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.
Hey!
No!
Yeah?
Okay.
Well, I'll be waiting for you, just come up when you're done.
Oh!! I love this job! Wow! My first call.
Rossy, Rossy.
Well, there's you.
Well that's his last name.
You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!
Excuse me. It's about the job.
Uhh.... waitressing?
Or ya know, he's rubber and you're glue.
What are you doing?! Get in the front!
All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!
Come on, it's a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasn't smoked since.
Yes! He has a naked picture of Monica! He takes naked pictures of us! And then he eats chicken and looks at them!
Yeah. Well. Hey uh Joe, would mind going over to Chandler's bedroom and get that book back that he borrowed from me?
Okay.
Yeah?
I am not a pushover!
Basketball!
Okay.
Yeah, why?
Yeah! And until now, I didn't think I'd love again.
And?
Why aren't you at work?
Whoa-whoa, there's two living rooms? God, growing up here, this place must've been a real babe magnet.
Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out!
You'd be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me?
Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!
Oh-hooo, I missed you.
Gay? Yeah.
Yeah, right. Sure!
Oh my God!
OK, Ross, listen to me, I am not yours to save.
Honey, I'm just checking.
What's this?
Really!
Huh. A moo-point?
Oh, look, wish me luck!
What? No! It's not a big deal! I do that too, with my shampoo bottle.
Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that it was a club they went to. Oh God, I'm, I'm sorry.
All right that's it! I am maid of honor!
Hey, this is hollow.
You...are...not going to believe it! Joshua came into work today, and guess what happened?
Oh yeah, sure, that too.
Hey.
Hi!
I can't do this.
Oh y'know what? Y'know what? Now that you know what you want you should go to Kleinman's and get it half off. This place is so overpriced.
So just bring it back downstairs, what's the problem?
We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it's actually for Joshua. Look, he said he's not ready to date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I have the perfect opportunity to seduce him!
C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
Yes, we do.
Chandler! Is he?
Umm, when were you gonna tell me that you're going out with Chip Matthews?
Well...
Look Joey, come on she's so perfect for you! I mean she's sweet, she-she likes baseball, and she-she had two beers at lunch.
Hi sweetie!
What-yeah-what, y'know what? I hope Emily is a lesbian.
Okay, well can't you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?
Agghhh.
Petty...
Oh, sorry. I meant Chandler.
Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.
Oh, you're one of those. But y'know what? I have two sisters of my own and we just-just tortured each other.
Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.
Okay.
Yeah! Once, I figure out what I'm wearing.
Ohhhhhhhh God.
Oh, Chandler!! All right, this is it! You never see Joanna again!
All right.
Well, y'know he lost his keys so he was looking for them...
What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense!
Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.
And?
You're right! I mean you're right! It wasn't just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in.
I can see that. I... just one phone call, I'll be very quick, I'll even pay for it myself. OK, you're bein' a little weird about your phone.
Hey!
What?!!
And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.
Okay, fine.
Yes!
No. I can't, you're a totally different person to me now. I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. God, and now I just can't stop picturing with her, I can't, it doesn't matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. It's just changed, everything. Forever.
All right, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't tell you but you were so mad already!
Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you're going to call her?
Okay, Ross, I'm really trying to tell you something here.
Hey! Hey!
Monica? Monica!
Yeah, yeah I think I'm gonna find my own place.
So uh, heard you had some fun with Tag last night.
Okay guys, way to wish me luck!
Bye house!
Ah, I-I never should have said what I said. It-y'know what? It just doesn't matter how I feel. I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay? Big day Monday lots to do. So, we're okay?
Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal.
Well, then I get to give him the cell phone.
Hey-whoa, slow down. No, keep moving. Wow!
Y'know, you should never be allowed to talk to people!
She'll be a much better friend when the market closes.
And I will see you tomorrow!
Thirty. Ugh, I mean thirty! Monica, do you remember mean, old Mrs. Kreeger in the fifth grade? She was thirty!
Well, look at that, same thing.
What? This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is not-that's-that's not what it is. See, see, okay, I work in fashion, see and-and, this is a real dress actually. It's-it's, they're-they're wearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how people respond, and then I report back to my superiors at Bloomingdale's, so... And obviously in uh, in-in this case, I am going to report back, "USA not ready."
You are so beautiful.
Wh--Why don't I tell you over here?
Noo.
Sagittarius?
Hi!
Were both of those Joey?
Really?
They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?
Okay, do you see, do you see what you're keeping me married too?!
Oh look who it is, my husband. The apple of my eye.
I'm sorry?
No, no Phoebe no, I was...no. You know what, I was, I was actually just checking to, see, if I could run. And I can!
Look, y'know I know my life's going pretty well, but I look around and I just see so many people who've accomplished so many other goals by the time they're thirty.
Hi Pheebs!
Pardon?
Ohhh...
See, I don't know, for me it would have to Chantal.
Well it's not, honey I'm sorry, I guess I'm just nervous. I mean, it's you, ya know, it's us. I mean, we're crossing that line, sort of a big thing.
Are ah, having dinner with my Dad tomorrow night, I hope that's okay.
Ross, that was a Halloween costume, unless you would like me to go to this thing as Little Bo Peep.
Come on Joey, I just bought you a new chair! The most expensive one in the store! Hey, y'know what I was thinking? We could name her Francette.
Oh.
Ohh, so do you! Did you lose weight?
Yeah and you stretch 'em out with your big old clown feet.
Yay!
Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.
Don't call us that!
I don't know. Whatever I was feeling, I'm... not.
Hey, did you guys check out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom?
Okay, they are.
Oh honey, I'm so proud of you, Min.
Oh! Thank you!
Hello.
Yeah!
What is he doing here?!
Thank you!
Can I see that for second.
You never come into this office again!
Then, no.
Yeah. Yeah, and y'know you-you deserve to win. And-and y'know I was thinking about it, if-if you're Monica's maid of honor that means I get to be yours.
Well that sounds kinda cool, kinda like The Hobbit.
Afraid to ask him?
Joey, God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees!
Jeez!
Well, I-I-I've been on Standby for a flight home for hours.
No!! No! He's not married, or involved, with anyone!
No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!
Hi.
And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down?
Sure.
BACK OFF!!! Get up! Get up! Get up! God damn it! Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!!
What are you going to make?
Umm, hi!
Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!
Not right now.
Ohh, sorry.
Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.
Ah, yeah!
Hi. Sorry, things aren't working out so well.
Y'know what? That's a lot to remember, can't I just tell her you're a pig?
Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I've ever heard.
Ok, let me take these cakes back 'cause they're gonna take that out of my paycheck.
Oh well then, so I'm just going to go back to talking to my friend here. And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.
Oh, I can not believe you didn't tell me!
Yeah! His name is um, Mark something.
Really.
Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got all over head!
: Loser?
Well...
Arghhhh!!!!!!
Well yeah, sure, what's up?
Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, arm around her. Cramp, cramp.
Ethan called again.
No! There's no orange juice in there! We win!!
What? Wait! Why...why do you get the story?
Isn't that a line from the show?!
Wh?!
Oh, I don't know. I guess it's not about no guys, it's about the right guy, y'know? I mean, with Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat. With Paolo, that's all there was, was heat! And it was just this raw, animal, sexual...
When she sees that you're gone, she's gonna know that I let you out, and that I was in here, and I'm gonna get fired!
Y'know, I can not believe you told him, Joey!
I can get a quick bite to eat, but then I have to come back up here.
Yeah, I admit it. I have a crush on you, and uh, and, and I know that's crazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing I want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now.
Oh, did you not want people to know that?
Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.
Oh God Monica hi! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
Gimme an 'L!'
What?
Op! We gotta go!
Umm, I think there was a restaurant... I know there was wine. . .
Hi, I'm sorry, I need to borrow your phone for just one minute.
Ohhh... Okay, you were right. You were right! This was just not worth it.
Ow!
Okay? Wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please? I mean tell me that you like him.
What do you mean, you fold? Hey, come on! What is this? I thought that 'once the cards were dealt, I'm not a nice guy.' I mean, what, were you just full of it?
Oh. That's so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, 'Where's number 27?!'
Hi. Sorry, things aren't working out so well.
My God!
Rachel...
I... Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for?
What?
What?!
You guys wanna get some coffee?
Because, I wanted to hurt you.
Hey!
You dont even have cats.
Well I just came... I just needed to tell you... Congratulations.
Great set tonight Phoebs.
Hm-mmm.
Hey!
Ohh, good.
What!
Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend.
Rome. Jerk missed his flight.
Well, honey that was pretty obvious.
I don't know where the phone is.
Hi, Mindy. Hi, it-it's Rachel. Yeah, I'm fine. I-I saw Barry today. Oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me. No, no, it's okay. I hope you two are very happy, I really do. Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end up getting married and having kids- and everything- I just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose. Okay, I know it was a cheap shot, but I feel so much better now.
Get down?
Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus?
I'm just bummed about the way I left things with Ross. I shouldn't have lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me.
From now?
Oo, I can't watch this, it's like Sophie's Choice.
Hi...
I just purchased the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000.
Why would you even want to come Ross? You're a horrible skier.
Oh my God! I can not believe that! I mean I don't really like it when Ross goes out with anyone, but my sister isn't that like incest or something?! Oh my God, and they're gonna have sex! Oh! Oh no what if he marries her too?! Oh this is just terrible, this is just terrible. And I can't stop it! I can't-I don't own Ross! Y'know? And Jill, she should be able to do whatever it is that she wants to do! And oh my God, I can't believe Ross is marrying my little sister, this terrible. Oh my God, this is just the worst thing that could have ever happened to me.
I know.
So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?
Oh my God, they let you keep that stuff?!
Yep!
Oh hell, he's done this three times! He knows what its about!
Well, I'm also sending out.... good thoughts.
Monica, I don't want to lose 200 dollars.
Yeah, looks that way. First ones here! Wooo!!
Oh I don't-I don't know.
No, it's been three nights in a row.
Well now what's the rush?
Uh, credit card.
Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do? You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right here. Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you happy now?!
Um-hmm. There we go. There it is.
Yes, yes it is true. And I know this because, because he pretended to be Drake to, to sleep with me.
Joey.
Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm not saying that you shouldn't have a bag, I just-it's just there are other bags that are a little less umm, controversial.
Well, let me just check that with what I got here, all right see 038 is not the number for this store, 038 is Atlanta. And I...
Okay, so anyway I'm sittin' in my office and guess who walks in.
Yeah.
Wow! If only more people knew.
We won. We won!
Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it's peepee time. Hey, Mr. Trib.
I said I'll do it!
Oh c'mon Joey, we care about you.
I know.
No, was he any good in it?
Hey!
Wait a minute. Chandler has a jewelry box?
Well, I was actually-I-I came over here to-to borrow this lamp. To umm, look at my books, y'know, see them a little better.
I'd need an expense account.
I care!
Yeah, sure.
What?
Well, thank you, Melanie.
Oh, Mon, sure.
The commercial?
I'm sorry, sweetie.
And-Joey!
What?!
Oh. Okay, bye.
Oh yeah. Right. So now, are-do you, do you still do music?
No.
Ok, so let's talk money.
When somebody does not buzz you in, Ross, that means go away. That doesn't mean please climb up the fire escape.
With ah, extra anchovies.
Hey, Pheebs!
C'mon up.
Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, she's gonna get over this, y'know? I mean, so you said my name! Y'know you just said it 'cause you saw me there, if you'd have seen a circus freak, you would've said, "I take thee circus freak." Y'know, it didn't mean anything, it's just a mistake. It didn't mean anything. Right?
Hey Jess.
Uhhh, yeah. But it's not obvious why.
Oh no-no-no-no-no, no you don't!
You're lookin' at it upside down-y'know what? It doesn't matter.
I'm not paying for half of that! I'm only staying here until my apartment gets fixed.
Hello?
I'll be right there! Okay, Ross, please come on! I thought we have moved on! I thought we've gotten to a place where we could be happy for each other! I mean was that just me?
AND YOU KNOW!!!
Oh, I think I saw some in here.
Okay! Check it out!
Sp-spoil?
I am so psyched I kept this chair for myself!
I'm sorry, what did you just say? Did you just say hi? Oh my God, Ross, Ross, Ben just said 'Hi'.
Done.
Oh, hi! How are you doing?
Who is it?
I think she's checking out your beehive Ross.
Cool... "Urkel" in Spanish is "Urkel."
So, um, will you bring the truck?
Well, people are different.
No, I was ten. I just developed early.
It just might be too hard, given the history and all that...
Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi.
Tell Monica I'm sorry.
Oh, I gotta get my ticket!
I'm not saying that I'm a lesbian! I'm just saying that this happened!
Yeah I know. She ran into him at my office and they just...made out. And the craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because I told her about it and she said it was the best gossip she'd heard all year.
I know, I can do more than cook.
Whoa, that Diet Coke just went straight to my head! Woo!
Excuse me?
What 'cha doing Mon?
Bye.
Yes.
So umm, what time are you supposed to leave?
Hey Phoebs, how'd it go with Scott last night?
I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he left because of you!
Hey, c'mon, cut it out.
Oh my....
Pretty much.
Okay, y'know what, y'know what? This playing hard to get thing is not working. Umm, hand-hand me those cherries. Okay. Okay. Hi!
All right, all right, all right. Last night, I had a dream that, uh, you and I, were...
Yes, but you can not tell Ross 'cause I want to surprise him.
Hi Danny! Wow! Thirsty huh?
Oh, um, no, no, no, no excuse me, hello. Hi. My friend ordered an onion, not an olive, and uh I ordered a rum and Diet Coke, which I don't think this is.
Fine.
Oh.
She's right. She's right. You are no different than the rest of them.
Of course they're listening to you! Everybody listens to you.
Oh wait, I have the ten of spades! Here!
Well, yeah! We're cool. Totally cool.
Ross, she's gonna start getting ready soon!
Ahh.
Let's do it! Ross?
Well, y'know what, that doesn't matter.
I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down.
Dealer takes two. What do you bet?
Oh, that's funny!
Do you have any ice?
It'll be a short one.
Oh tomorrow, oh I don't know. Um...
You had no right coming down to my office Ross. You do not bring a picnic basket to somebody's work! Unless maybe they were a park ranger!
Aww, look at the little thing.
Oh-oh-oh, which one is Bonnie again?
No! Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn't mean I wanna walk around naked. I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.
Mon. Hi!
Wow. I, I don't even know what to say. Thank you.
Well, hello, Mr. Rachel!
But don't you think Rosita would've wanted you to move on? I mean y'know, she did always put...your comfort first.
No, wait Phoebe.
Ross, what's the big deal? So I kissed the guy!
Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when they're done with them they just send 'em back.
And Ross.
Oh! I knew it! What happened?
Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way. Here are your keys, hon.
What? C'mon you guys, I don't care, I have a date tonight.
Ohh, my new assistant is working out, yes.
Look, I cannot do this right now, okay, I've got a deadline, would you just go home, I'll talk to you later.
Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist...
Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!
Yeah. What kind of discount do we get?
Well yeah, I wish that you would. Well, no it's not in there! How about that drawer?
Well excuse me, my fashion-impaired friends, I am here to tell you that hats are back.
Ugh!
Ow, you stop flicking.
How long do cats live?
Aww.
Okay, y'know what? We don't need her measurements.
Hi.
Fancy soap? I thought we were savin' that for the Pope!
Hi.
Wait a minute!
Cat! What'm I saying? Cat!
Um-hmm, yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.
Ahhhhh, salmon skin roll.
Hi. Listen, I was um, thinkin' about. . .
Not great.
Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos
Do you guys know any cute guys?
No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you'll have to think of something else.
I mean I think I'd say no to anybody right now. Oh, but it was so strange. I mean I'm standing there with this charming, cute guy, who's asking me to go out with him, which I'm allowed to do, and I felt guilty. Y'know, like I'd be cheating on Ross or something.
Well, I-I don't like it.
Hi! Well, we were just about to take off and see a movie. Oh no!
Oh, great could you make me four copies of those?
I know isn't it? It's like I'm right there with Joshua.
Career counselor?
Okay!
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. They used to live here; sometimes they migrate back over.
Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him.
No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times.
Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!
Well I've had it.
All right. Okay Chandler, enjoy your handful.
I don't care! All right, y'know what I'm just upset that I'm getting nowhere with Joshua that-y'know what still, you do not meet someone and go flitting off to Vermont!
Nice seizing. . . gel boy.
Ooohhhh!!
Even when we were having sex in that chair?
Thank you.
Well and clearly not a minute sooner.
Hi!
Well you uh, you were always really good at the uh, at the uh the stuff.
Hi! Sorry to bother you, but I don't think we can accept your acceptance of our apology, it just doesn't really seem like you mean it.
Oh, I know, I know.
No-no, but I support it.
I'm sure he will forgive you. Look, we have all been there! Y'know, you fight, you make up, it's just the way it works.
Okay. Umm, well, first I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you.
Okay, you're right. You're right. You can't help me.
Ohhhhh, don't be mad...
I know! I know, it's such a huge, life-altering thing.
I can't believe this is happening.
I need to talk to you!
Huh. Except, Phoebe's not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.
Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?
Oh, do I?
No. No, you can't.
No.
Yeah! I got my girls.
Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!
Ohh...
Small...
What? What are you talking about?! You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on. I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me. Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go.
Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago.
Oh it's OK. You were worth the wait, and I don't just mean tonight.
Anything?
Yeah, sure, okay. Okay.
No, it's not gonna be okay Ross, tomorrow is my last day, and I don't have a lead. Okay, y'know what, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna call Gunther and I'm gonna tell him, I'm not quitting.
Ohhhhhh, look it's the roller blades.
Thanks!
Monica, can Phoebe borrow your green dress?
Ross!
Well then you're going to have to take her out again.
Hey!
Ross.
Really! What is with that guy? I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you.
What?
I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.
Ohh, well I'm not totally back yet, but thank you.
It's not funny, this is actually my job.
Well, we were just talkin' about you guys gettin' married and how great it is.
Nothing!
Chandler! Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back the way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, she's very private about her office. Now I know why.
Y'know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding, it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.
Oh yeah, no, what's that?
Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama.
I would love to live with you Ross; that's-that's great! Thank you!
HI!! Hi!
Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?
Okay.
Oh I know, my God, this is so-this rice is so-I am so good.
Okay. Happy birthday Grandma! It's better to be over the hill then buried under it. All our love Monica and Chandler. That's funny, yeah!
Oh, y'know I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. I--Wow. My God, so creamy. Oh my God, this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. Where did you get this?
Hey Pheebs, you're still alive! How are you doing?
I want the little round waffles.
No?
We went through a lot of wine tonight, you guys.
Oh! Well let's look for them. Oh-oh-hey! Are these them?
Ugh!!! Well, the apartment is already subletted! I mean, this is just hopeless. I'm never gonna find anything.
Well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans?
Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided thisthis whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea.
Well okay-Well don't ruin it! Just play along at least!
Yes!! I mean sex does not have to be a big deal! There shouldn't be all this rules and restrictions! Y'know, people should be able to sleep with who ever they want, whenever...
No! Wait! Come on!
Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair.
You mean, you mean 30 days?
I meant er, young, young, I meant young, young to be a doctor. Oh good, Rach.
Y'know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding, it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.
Oh wow! Look at this place!
Hey-hey-hey that's funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy! You wanna know what else is really funny?!
I'm fine! I'm fine! I'm just losing a tooth, it's no big deal. I have a dentist! Y'know. I'm gonna go put some ice on it. Excuse me. What do I do now? What do I do now?
Shut up!
I'm sorry, what?
Ugh.
Yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me?
Oh, you know what, we haven't even looked yet.
I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.
Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross. I said don't go!
What?
Better than Chandler.
No-no-no, no, honey please, I've got, I've just have so much to deal with.
Both of you?
Uh, OK, I mean uh, what, how are you gonna handle it. I mean, are, are ya gonna, are ya gonna talk about it before hand, are you just gonna pounce?
No.
I had a wedding.
Y'know what, just give me a second and I'll be out of your hair. I'm just gonna grab a jacket. When I get back, I want every little detail. Maybe that's him.
I know. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. All right, this is what we're gonna do, we are gonna go to the next highest bidder, and we are just gonna let them buy it, and then you're just gonna pay the difference.
That's fine. So Monica, you are now in control of my love life.
You and Ralph?
Okay, good. Now that since you know, when you come over would you mind actually using it?
Well, what are you going to wear?
Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you sailor?!
No! Wait! Wait-wait! Ross, please!
We should defiantly play football more often. Maybe there's a like league we could join or something.
Do you guys want these?
Monica, what are you talking about?
Uh-oh.
Yeah, I can do that.
Joey?
Yeah! Remember I got that uh, gala.
Okay. Okay fine, y'know what? We will let Ross and Joey decide. Hiiiii, Ross! Sweetie.
What?
OH MY GOD!!!
Oh yeah. In fact you know what I'd do?
Get out, get out of my apartment.
What?
Well, yeah, y'know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again? I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.
Oh sure it is!
You give me back my Walkman!
Well I assume the ah, happy couple isn't up yet. Did you guys hear them last night?
You had to do it, didn't you? You couldn't just leave it alone.
What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?
We just uh, we just met at the newsstand. We both grabbed for the last Field & Stream. What? I read that.
Well, I guess I could take a couple days off work.
Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.
Yeah!
I love it at Joey's!
Well, y'know it's just been so long since I've been to Chuckie Cheese.
Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that.
Hey! Y'know what? Let's talk about relationships!
Monica, what are you doing?
Really?! You think that will work?
Oh wow, uh okay, uh maybe. Umm, yes, I can do that!
It's fine.
Oh my God.
Oh wow. Are you in trouble.
Hey-hey, you guys oh hurry up, get some, there's a whole cart outside...
I'm doin' good, baby. How you doin'?
Wow.
Yeah?
Okay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff.
Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let's talk about it!! How was she?
Sophie's desk.
Oh Monica, we are so sorry.
We can't find Chandler...-'s vest. We can't find Chandler's vest.
Y'know...
Okay. Okay, we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels great.
It's a pretty cool tux.
Oh, good for you!
Sweety...
We use it!!
But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was clear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like...
Oh. Ohhhhhhhhh....
Well y'know what they say, the 23rd time's the charm. Aww, look at you all handsome!
'Okay. Okay, daddy we'll see you tomorrow night. Okay bye-bye.'
Oh my God! Listen to you talkin' about having kids. Oh my Joey. Oh, please don't get married before I do.
Oh.
Well neither do I!
Huh.. How about 600?
Oh. Oh, that's great!
Yeah, I do. I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear your head, I think it'd be really good.
Ohh! Oh God!
Yeah!
Does anybody want anything else?
Oh, please, Ross it was so obvious! It was like you were marking your territory. I mean you might have well have just come in and peed all around my desk!
Aside from the fact that you said you had them?
Oh, hi!
Monica, this is Dan , one of the guys that we're gonna be going out with on Saturday. Uh Dan, Monica.
Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair. So this is pretty rare. How did you get that?
Hey!
Yeah. And y'know who should've shut their drapes? Is that perverted old couple two doors over.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting.
Hey Chandler!
Oh they're in the top drawer. Hurry.
Well, uh, I-I don't know. See when-when you put it that way y'know it does sort of...
That had to hurt!
That's right! 'Cause that would give him the control! So now he's all ooh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing y'know, trying to get me to hint around for an invitation. Blew up in his face, didn't it?
Ohh, honey no problem. Okay.
What is the emergency?!
Ok honey, you really need a job.
Ohh, thank you for the wonderful dinner.
Hi honey!
How can you not remember us kissing?!
Well, is Ross home? Maybe I'll just call him to see if he's actually seen her.
Bye-bye.
Oh that.
Actually, I just wanna talk to Tag.
Sure, is she married?
I don't know, something either trees or disease-Ralph mumbles a lot.
I know.
Monica! I couldn't find him for two hours! He was having sex with Amy Welch!
Hang in there. You hang in there.
Just one cheek.
This is totally your fault!
So I hear the Ralph Lauren fooled around with someone in the copy room.
I'm gonna marry someone good y'know.
Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am still your wife!! What, were you just never gonna tell me?!! What the hell is wrong with you?!!!! Ugh, I could just kill you!!!!
Well Chandler, what is this very weird, metal A Z thing?
No, it's not better. I still don't get to see you.
Hey!
Bye. What a manipulative bitch.
Uh, I don't know. Why don't you put it right here next to my water?
Wait, so, you're going?
No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling.
Yeah!
Hi!
Well, oh, Mark, I'm doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know? I'm just doing it to get back at Ross. I'm sorry, it's not very fair to you.
Just give us our apartment back!
What?
I don't know, I'm sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here.
Of course!
Really?! Got a little crush on Tag there do ya?
Bathroom's up there.
Oh! Oh, I just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you.
That almost hit me in the face.
Okay.
Hi, hi can I help you?
Oh no-no-no...
Oh wow, uh okay, uh maybe. Umm, yes, I can do that!
Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming!!
Ohh! That's great!
Hey, Mon, I was just doing the dishes!
Yeah, but umm... Yes, but, Fonzie was already cool, so he wasn't hurt, right?
Ok, while you "mmm" on it for awhile, I'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp.
All right Paul, I'm not asking for a lot here. Okay? Just give me something. Anything!
Yeah, I-I-I-I'm funny Ben, but I'm not stupid. Okay?
Yeah well, Ross just made plans for the whole century.
...Monica.
Hey, come on now!
Oh. We?
Yeah, I know, go long. Y'know, it's like all I'm doing is running back and forth from the huddle.
No....
Who?
He's coming over! He's coming over!
Ohh, I'm gonna have to get over it. God, see I didn't know that's I had to do, I just have to get over it.
Yeah but, maybe it's not what we think. Maybe it's tell Monica I'm sorry I...drank the last of the milk.
That-that is your make out buddy. Don't you recognize him? Oh wait. Ohh, Phoebe I love you. Kiss me please.
What?
Yeah, we got him back. Everything's fine.
Oh thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Emily?
Daddy.
Yeah but-but-but you liked me! Oh my God, I can't believe this, all this time, I liked you and you liked me!
Oh, thank God.
Pheebs?
Well! Good night. I'm going upstairs.
Yeah me too.
Ohh... I mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that happen?
Oh my God, wait did I-I just said Greens don't quit didn't I? Did I just say Greens don't quit?!
No, y'know what? Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! Or something!
Um-hmm.
Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.
Oh it's important!
Oh my God, Monica's gonna go out with a millionaire.
Yeah that's right! Come on Joey; sex me up!
Oh my God! Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives, just walked in here!
Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room.
Nice! One and a half carat easy.
Ohh...
Uh-huh.
You look so beautiful.
Ohh, well, this is just perfect!
Hey! What happened to you? Why didn't you come up?
Hi, I'm sorry I'm late but I am ready, ready to talk you up! When does Liz's father get here?
No-no, that wasn't me! Well, we should get started. Let me show you my underwear. The selection of underwear we carry.
Okay. All right. Honey listen. When I tell you what I'm about to tell you, I need you to remember that we are all here for you and that we love you.
Hi.
Drums?
Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?
Wow. Wow, that's great. Great. Ok, wow, you know what.
Oh, hmm.
I know! What?!
You have a play date with a stripper?!
Thank you. What a bitch.
Really?
Okay, I'll see you back at home, if I ever get a flight out of here.
Yeah, I went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two months later the couple got divorced. And now I'm not saying that there's any connection here y'know, but they did tell me that's why they got divorced.
...and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!
What?! You kissed!
Hi! Wow! You look, you look...big.
No honey, we're sorry, we didn't mean it. I love you. I love you.
I guess.
OK, OK. I'm with you, Cheech. OK.
Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that's why you have got to be the bigger man here.
Settle what?
What do you, what do you mean?
You do? Why?
She could be you.
We have to get her a present?!
Yeah... ....OK. Where were we? Oh, OK... five card draw, uh... jacks or better... nothing wild, everybody ante.
I did not!
Take 'em! Joey, you can touch them! They're your underwear.
Well, well um, you know, these movies are offensive and uh, degrading to women and females. And uh, and the lighting's always unflattering. And, Monica help me out here.
Look, I know what's going on here, okay, Mark explained it all to me. He said this is what you guys do.
Whatever Linus, I'm opening mine.
Yeah.
Me too!
Oh that's great!
So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?
Okay no, you do it.
Well, I...
I ah... Oh! I'll squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning!
Um, hum.
Aww, look at the little thing.
Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?
Oh my God!
Take it like a man, Ross!
What if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and I answer and we start talking and we fell in love. I mean wouldn't that be a great story? Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.
And did you?!
Hey Mon, little question for ya! How do you think this suit will look on an assistant buyer?
Monica, number one, I don't think Ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, I... What?!
The meeting with the guy went great?
Well, are we all together? Like in a group?
Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!
Hi you guys.
Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.
There it is.
No! It didn't! That's what I want to talk to you about. Now, just to brief you... I may cry, but they are not tears of sadness or of anger, but just of me having this discussion with you.
Right.
Oh my God.
Really?
Do you really not know where I'm going with this? It left! It's one huge room!
He-he said Rachel, right? Do you think I should go up there?
Oh my God!
It's the same story.
Hello? Oh, Pheebs! It's Phoebe!
Why aren't you home yet?!
Yeah, you like that baby? May we help you?
What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?
Or I'll give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua.
Let's roll!
Joey?!
Okay Joey honey, you're doing really good! All right, now I'm just gonna need you to step to the port side. Remember? Remember how we talked about the port side?
Oh please, I hate packing, it's closer to work, and we do have fun. Although, I'm really gonna miss living with you.
What?
Ugh, she is a slut!
Well no brush!
I know, yeah, sorry.
No! You guys can't leave yet! You have to stay, we-we got the whole big thing planned!
Rock-paper-scissors?
So did you read your evaluation yet?
And then, I don't know, I mean you'd pull me really close to you so that, so that I'd be pressed up, you know, right against you. And, um, it would get kind of sweaty and uh, and blurry, and then it's just happening.
Hi!
Y'know Bob in Human Resources...
Well, wait a minute, you're the boss! Why don't you just yell at them? Or, fire them?
Okay.
I know.
That's 'cause you have it.
Ross, Joey is not here.
I know, it's sick.
Bye.
What?
Yeah.
Wow! Monica!
Yes I did! And I put a little Post-It on it that said, "Must go out today," and underlined today three times and, and then I put a little heart in the corner because I didn't want to seem to bossy.
Yeah, oh wait!
No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!
Here you go.
Monica, I'm quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn't even buy it! I'm telling you I'm quitting! That's it! I'm talking to my boss right now! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you get this message.
Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things.
Vogue! Hey, so tell me about this Jane Eyre woman.
No.
Oh, isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula.
Not even with your best friend.
Oh Ross, come on! This is not, this is not a marriage!! This is the world's worst hangover! Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I will!
There's nobody here!
I did.
Oh well...
Say more things like that.
Monica.
I'm sorry, Rosita? As in...
How many you want?
No! Help me!
Oh, well, that shouldnt be so hard, now that youre dating. "Sweetheart, youre fired, but how bout a quickie before I go to work?"
Oh! See just I'm right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being alone, sucks!
Oh, if I only want two kids, can I keep him for another year?
Yes.
Oh no-no-no-no-no, no, no! We, you with someone and me with someone.
Oh, wait! Sorry, Mr. Paul? Mr. Paul?
So now, what exactly is the point of the box?
Shut up that was my friend Melissa from college.
Want a wedding dress? Hardly used.
Shhh...I don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented.
Do you guys ever get the feeling that um, Chandler and those guys just don't get that we don't make as much money as they do?
Okay, uh...
What? You didn't get one.
You mean the mom you met in Montauk. She was a cat?!
I-I don't want your job. I-I don't. Ohh this is such a mistake. I did not make out with him. Nobody made out with him. I did not use my keycard yesterday. I don't even know how to use my keycard.
Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye.
Have at it.
You don't even know!
Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! Every place I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. I mean, look at this; "Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." It's just, there is nothing! The city's full!
What?!
I couldn't be inner. Monica?
Uh-oh.
