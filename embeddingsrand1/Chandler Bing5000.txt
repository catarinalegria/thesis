What? Why?
Yeah?
Really.
Where ya going?
Okay, here is the phone bill.
Hi!
Yeah-yeah, me neither.
I shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right?
You're naked in this picture!
All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
Oh, okay!
Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!
Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.
Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!
Yes?
Work people? Nobody told me.
No!!
Hey, all right!
Oh my God!! Is everybody getting married?!!
Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.
Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.
Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?
See now it feels like Christmas!
Okay, we have to talk. I'm just getting out of a very serious relationship...
She has a real name.
Sure. What's up?
Thanks.
Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo. I added the "a-gogo."
You bet I did, Ben, put it there! Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small! Ho, ho, ho!
Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?
So, we gettin' a fish?
Okay! Oh man! Don't tell me I did this!
All right, y'know what? Forget it, all of you forget it! You've ruined it! Go home! You've ruined it! You've ruined it!
Is that supposed to be funny! I was really worried over here!
Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.
And the bunny got away.
We have free porn here!!!
See Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed.
Yeah, I'll sit down.
Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.
Congratulations.
Listen to me!!
No. All right, y'know what, she's gonna think that I'm handing you a credit card, but what I'm really gonna do is hand you a library card.
Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.
No-no-no-no-no!
Excellent! Y'know Ross met somebody too!
Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
You wanna share it?
Okay, here we go.
Well, we're-we're hanging out in here!
I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.
Well, only if you order stuff.
Do you mind if we stick you in another cabinet? They seem all right with it!
Can I sleep on your couch?
And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.
Yeah, I think it is!
Say 200?
Oh, then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it.
Well, I've got a girl in here.
It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert...Look talk to Monica, she's on the food committee.
Can you hold on a moment? I have another call. I love her.
I did pay for half of it.
Yeah, but Sebastian? What is that? A cat's name?
My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross!
Yeah, big zero gravity moon steps.
Daaahhhh!
Does anybody know me?!
Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her....
Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image?
Huh.
What?!
I do?
You sure?
Are you actually saying these words?
Get in here! Hey, and you can not smoke in here! Merry Christmas.
Oh, do you not want to?
Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?
Where did you, when did you, how did you... How did you get a girl like that?
Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.
No I didn't!
Not once!
Uh, Ross?
No, I just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them. Hello sweet pants!
Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum.
Okay, but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter than I am.
I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships.
You have to give 'em something, you know. Okay, now that was Gerston, Santos, and who's the guy with the moustache?
Consider Casey.
You can call off the roommate search! Hi! I'll be living here.
You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?
I'm gonna hold him a different way. Look I don't understand, if you hated it so much, why did you buy it in the first place?
And I'm cute too.
What is going on?
So how's Mindy?
All right look, I'm changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer.
Do you know why?
Would you come on! Come on! Thank you.
Okay.
Wax the door shut, we're never leaving, ever.
No, we only went out once.
Come on Monica, it's our Valentine's Day. Please? Please-please, please?
Pheebs?
Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you...
So, we'll do the rest of the bills later then?
What we want honey.
Hi!
Yeah!
Can I use your phone?
What in God's name is that?!
By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don't want her to come back to bad cheesecake.
Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.
She was kidding.
I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.
Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.
Hey.
Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
Yeah, you got me. I'm out five big ones! Here you go.
Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?
Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor.
What? What are you, what are you talking about?
Hey, so can you make it on Friday?
All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?
Hey.
And we're changing.
I can't believe we are even having this discussion.
Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname?
You know, I don't get this. A month ago, these people were my friends. You know, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I'm a different person.
But I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
Oh, good. Rog is here.
All right, you will notice that I am fully dressed. I, in turn, have noticed that you are not. So in the words of A. A. Milne, "Get out of my chair, dillhole!"
You understood that?
And?
Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.
No-no, he's not back yet, but he'll be here any minute. So uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?
And last but not least.
Monica...
Hey, there he is! There he is!
Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum!
I can't believe you did this.
I'm sorry too.
You mean like, music?
Okay.
So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!
Phoebs, play with meeee.
Yes! You mean the world the world to me. Oh...
All right, check it out. Check this out. It says here that there's a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! "It's almost as good as being there."
Okay.
You'll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.
So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.
Our eyes are closed and we're about to cross the street. Very good.
Nice save.
Yeah!
Oh hey listen, don't be mad at him, it's our fault. I'm sorry we've been hoggin so much of his time.
Yes!
I got glasses!
Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.
I broke up with her.
Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!!
Joe?
Really?
Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.
A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.
Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles.
Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! I'll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!
Sorry.
Yeah?
Hey!
I'd carry you around in my pocket.
Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty. Yep.
Well, what did the police say?
Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break.
Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true.
...betrothed couple.
Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
Chandler.
Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y'know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!
Yeah, well, you're wrong! Okay, you're wrong.
You're welcome.
It's okay, I want this to be your night too. To Monica.
Yeah, he let us drive his Jaguar. Joey for 12 blocks, me for 15.
He paints quite a picture doesn't he?
Hey!
I love you so much.
I can't believe I did this! What an idiot!
I will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now. How can you eat the cheesecake without me?!
Hey!
I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream now, right?
Yes. Hey, can I ask you, is Eddie a little...
Yeah, not bad right? You know what, Monica's gonna be working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know what else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who wouldn't wanna live with me?
No, no, no, actually losers rhyme.
Aw, don't do that
But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, because my Mom won't let me cross the street.
Big dog?
...spender.
Probably because...
Oh, are we playing this?!
What?
Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?
First of the month.
No!
Really!
Yeah, that's like the most ugliest dress I've ever seen. Wh-why do you to return it?
Hi.
Before you say anything, have we got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner!
Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat. . . all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem.
Skull?
Really?!
And, a lemon lime.
That's a good idea, 'Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday'. I would like to get her something serious.
Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to face-And by face I don't mean his lap. And by face, I don't mean my ass.
Ow!
Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.
Oh, what a crappy night!
So, the ebola virus. That's gotta suck, huh?
Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.
Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.
Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!
Okay, that hurt us.
You done?
Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie?
Okay.
Bye. Are you still out there?
Funniest? Heckles?
Oh, that's Ross's.
Okay!
And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.
Stay back, I've got kiwi. Run, Joey, Run!
Oh yeah, totally!
Are you all right?!
Hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. That is very dad.
Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means we're unhappy forever. Sound good?
I'll cancel the sodas.
I don't have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!
Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you.
Okay, you get her in here. You bolt the door. I'll be in the closet.
Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?
Well, there you go.
What?!
"Benefits lapsed."
Y'know what, we have to turn off the porn.
I said, "Like what?"
Ehh.
Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card people.
Hey.
Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare.
Yes.
I did! But the store wouldn't take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?
I'm not arguing with that.
You're arranging flowers! You got dead flowers! You got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! This is not Joey!!
That's what Monica said.
Whoa-whoa-whoa! What?
Oh, now? No, no, I think something this nice should be saved for a special occasion.
All right, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna get shot down. Any advice?
If it helps, I could slide over.
Oh, uh, he's not here right now, uh, I'm Chandler, can I take a message, or, or a fishtank?
No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
I'll go.
All right, I'm nine years old.
Does this mean we're gonna have to start paying for coffee?
Then why-why is she going to a play?!
Good! I haven't smoked yet today, I feel great, and-and-and confident, that is a stunning blouse.
I've had a very long, hard day.
Well, this is just as boring in England.
Ooh, you almost had it.
Thanks!
What's this?
That was pretty intense huh?
Stretchy pants! Why, those are the greatest things in the world! If I were you I would wear them every day, every day!
No they didn't!
Thank you.
There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!
The man is showing brain.
Could we be more white trash?
Alright, I hope you realize you're not getting these underpants back.
That's the way I did it 'til I was 19.
Get out. Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
Okay.
Hey. Do you want this scone? It came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you!
Yes! Good thing we have that, 'Not in New York' rule.
No! That was a test! In a couple of hours I'm gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! And then after that, I'm gonna get so drunk, I'm gonna wanna call Janice
Hello. Hi, Janice! Can you hold on for a second? Okay. Okay, what do I do?
I'm gonna grab you some tissue.
Turns out he is kinda funny.
Yes. She was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me. Janice is my last chance to have somebody.
Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back.
Are you serious?
No sir.
Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please?
Well, have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for?
Listen Phoebe, he's right. People are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31.
Just tell her the truth! Tell her you're not ready.
No!
Okay!
Well, I don't really know what that is, but let's!!
Yeeeeahhhh.
You're not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?
Well, that's the best kiss I've had with anyone I've ever met in a men's room.
Really? Okay. Great!
Oh, I know. This must be so hard. Oh, no. Two women love me. They're both gorgeous and sexy. My wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight.
Oh that's great! Right there! Can we get some of that over here please? There we go.
Oh No, It's Terrific, It'S- It'S- Y'Know, You Deserve This, After All Your Years Of Struggling, You'Ve Finally Been Able To Crack Your Way Into Show Business.
This sounds like a hernia. You have to-you-you go to the doctor!
Like finding money with naked people on it!
Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...
Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states.
Hey Gar!
Okay, one more time.
Yeah. We're doing the right thing, right?
Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?
Oh really, I didn't know they had foosball in the 1800's.
You have to really wanna see it.
I can't talk to you now, I gotta find Monica!
Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.
Depends on what you mean by we.
I'm over here big guy.
Your just, your just clearly not familiar with our young persons vernacular. See, when we say dad, we mean buddy. We mean pal.
So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know.
I KNOW!!!
I'm an alien. I'm an alien.
Okay. I'm gonna get the ring! I'm gonna get the ring! I'm gonna go find her and I'm just going to propose!
It doesn't say that. Does it?
Y'know what? I have been trying to apologize to him all week! If he's not gonna let me do it on the phone, I'm gonna go down there and do it in person.
Ooh, let me talk to him!
You know what, okay, fine. Don't get up, you just sit right there. I just hope, you don't mind, you know, my hand right here. Op, not touching, can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad!
I thought it was $98.50.
I can't take the big white dog! You love it!
Hey, Janice.
When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.
Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, he'll never be President. There's never gonna be a President Joey.
Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we can't leave in the small apartment after we've lived here! Didn't you ever read Flowers for Algernon?
This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.
Well, why don't we move this into the bedroom?
I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!
Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you?
Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
Hey.
Why her mom?
They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!
Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet. And he was in the scale modeler's club, and I was, well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool.
You're not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.
Hey Caitlin! Somebody got a haircut.
Waitress. Got it. You guys wanna play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What else?
Y'know, I don't see that happening?
No, you kidding? The guy's a freak..
I can do that, I've had 30 years of practice.
Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.
Hey Mon, how's it going?
Yes?
Let me see this guy. W-H-Wow! Don't show this to Monica! And don't tell her about the W-H-Wow!
Monica and I are engaged.
Might wanna open with the snowman.
Thank you! All right, I gotta go unpack.
Oh, that's good. Maybe he'll hear you and pull the cord.
Well let's see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that's plural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing Bing! Great apartment Chandler Bing, Bing!
Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?
Okay. It's a racecar.
And this- is my reward!
Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.
Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter fluid-Op! Op!
Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think you're chances are pretty good. All right.
That's a hernia.
See, this is the brilliance of the show. I say always keep them running. All the time, running. Run. Run Yasmine, run like the wind.
Janice?
Do you have any beers? We're out of beers.
So, that's it?
See, maybe that's the one we should've actually hidden.
Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?
Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there?
Okay.
Joey!
And the Knicks rule all.
Marcel?
Yeah, what was wrong with your old...human teeth.
Oh, y'know what, I'm gonna be okay, you don't have to throw a party for me.
Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how I could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth.
I made that joke up.
I know what you meant!! You notice that ever since we got this chick, we've been fighting a lot more than we used too?
It's not all juice!
What, you never look down in the shower? Oh please. I'm not allowed to make one joke in the monkey-is-penis genre?
And there's daddy!
What-what Richard thing?
Hey-hey are you drunk?
Lick away my man.
I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.
What?!
Hey.
One nation, under God. Indivisible with liberty and justice for all. I remembered it. The champagne is here.
Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no.
Yeah, yeah! Me too!
Yeah.
But you found me!
No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?
I'm sure you're right, but why?
Hey!
He has sex, and we get hit in our heads.
Horn-swoggle.
See? They're Joey's! J-J-J-J-J-Joey's!
It's the Miracle Wax.
Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.
Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. I'll do it.
Joe?
OK, I'm officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me man. Joe? Well, I guess Joey went home. Oh and look, there's still one box that I have to unpack.
A hundred and forty-five pounds.
And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy.
Well, you couldn't get them anyway. Ian doesn't plan anymore and Derrick... And Derrick is a name I shouldn't know.
Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...
I'm sorry! Hey-hey Joe, why don't you uh, lift up your shirt? Take a look at this kiddo. We have a crying child! Roll the damn cameras!
I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.
Okay.
Yes that was a nice place!
So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve's doctor's name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, 'Doctor Monkey?' And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up.
Sure. And listen, thanks for doing that for us, by the way.
Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.
Fine.
But I'll tell you something. One of these days we're get off of our buts and rent Die Hard again!
And you're our age. You're our age.
Yes it would. What do you say to $50?
Okay, are you aware unagi is an eel?
Okay.
Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?
I see where you're goin'!
Yeah!
All right I'll have one.
No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen for you.
Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street.
Okay. Oh yes.
Hm-hmm, I told you! I can't believe that I've only got two hours before I call in sick for work.
Richard used to do it, didn't he?
Look, you can't call somebody after this long just to say, 'In case you didn't notice, I don't like you!'
Hey!
Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice.
What?!
Top of the world? Dock of the bay? I'm out.
I am pretending.
What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!
I know.
I think that's gum.
It's nice.
Sure I would!
...and then it got canceled.
You know what's weird. Donald Duck never wore pants. But whenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. I mean, what is that about?
Y'know what maybe it's gonna be okay, I mean it's been a week.
All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.
No, no, you're right, it is a ridiculous name!
Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn.
Because you've only known her for six weeks! Okay, I've got a carton of milk in my fridge I've had a longer relationship with!
I need to talk to you, it's urgent!
Oh my God! Who's gonna watch that?!
So in your whole life, you've only been with one oh.
Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year.
Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident?
We don't, really.
Excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos?
So, what do you thing the good news is?
What are you doing here?
I stole Monica's and changed the name.
It is the softest hair! Touch it!
Listen, I'm, I'm sorry I didn't make it over there today.
You wanna hug it out?
Would you like to have dinner sometime?
Heyyyy-What?
Could be Casey.
It can't happen like this. Okay? I'll meet you back at the hotel.
Oh yes! Oh yes!
Well she's, she's the kinda girl-Joey was unconscious.
Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it.
Okay, I don't think we can turn anymore!
Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!
Alright, hang on a second there Custer.
It's a buffet man.
Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...
Yeah.
Okay. Thanks.
If you said, "Big lima bean, bubbling up." Would she understand the difference?
Oh my... God?
Come on in.
I'm gonna put on some music.
There's a Phoebe on my sandwich!
So you knew we were gonna miss the movie!
Well, let's see... Okay uh, is that her?
C'mon, we're great together, why not?
Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!!
'Scuse me.
Absolutely!
Thanks.
Oh no-no-no!
Oh, I thought that's what they used to cover Connecticut when it rained.
Emotional Knapsack?
Really?
Ok, that's me.
Oh, yeah... yeah.
Well, that's pretty much all I'm looking for from these people.
Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea.
Hey!
Sure! That's one of the great things about being engaged. I'm not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore.
That's perfect! That's brilliant!
Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?
Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink.
So do I.
For an emergency just like this.
How do you feel about the, "I really did forgot the present, please forgive me" not fake out?
Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn break. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.
Hi.
Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.
He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!
What, you guys really think that I'm that shallow?
Thanks.
He started mine first!
Hey!
Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.
She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.
And is this in case the house sneezes?
Yeah, I'm gonna pass. 'Cause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies.
I'm gettin' my chair back!
Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not.
No!
All right!! Wait! Wait, there's no sidewalk! Yeah, I'm gonna die here.
Okay, that's like the least fun game ever.
I'm talking about you. You big, big freak.
Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?
It's not charity, Joe...
Yes, this, this was pleasant.
Really?
What?
Great! Okay, here.
She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you're gonna go?
How many times have I told you guys, you never watch the cooking channel!
And monkeys can't write out prescriptions.
To pay for the gym.
Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window.
Umm, yeah.
It doesn't scare me!
Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.
Yes, Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please?
Listen, I gotta talk to you.
Uhhuh, how did you know that?
Guys guys, check this out.
But...
I have the lung capacity of a two year old.
Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah, thanks.
Well that's good. Because you didn't! And I'm incredibly happy for ya!!
Again true.
Don't go.
Hey, this is so unfair!
Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.
Hey.
And no one touches the air around the TV!
Nothing!
You or me?
No, it's not! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monica's face when I gave it to her, y'know? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye. Look, this is the most important thing I'm gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure it's perfect.
Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this?
Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our relationship.
No?
Oh fresh air!
Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.
She's one of us now.
Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!
I don't know. I can't tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly.
Don't try to sway her. I'm your only chance to have a baby. Okay, let's go.
Central Perk?
No, I'm afraid I won't be able to make love as well as him.
Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right, Coach Ruben. Do you know what Pheebs? When you're done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too.
Okay, you give the worst massages in the world.
Y'know, we haven't found anybody else.
Really?! I didn't think girls ever just wanted a fling.
No! Ahhh!!!
Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place.
Forget it, that's off.
Wh-wh-why?!
Because I'm cooler.
What? That's terrible!
Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?
You see what I mean.
But come on, look at how cute and small this is! So I got it to give Monica so she'd know I was okay.
Oh wow, I hope you don't take this the wrong way but, I know we had plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, I'm just kinda worried about what it might do to our friendship.
Why don't you just give him to somebody else?
Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?
Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?
Ross is Batman!
There you go.
Yes, I did. I told it to Dan at work, and he said it was the funniest joke he'd ever heard.
She's smart and funny, y'know? We were up all last night talking, she said the funniest thing about--what?
That.
And he's not speaking metaphorically.
Would you just please....give me the receipt 'cause this is great. It's top notch.
Okay umm, before I meant you I had really little life and I couldn't imagine growing old with...
Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know she's too international, y'know she's never gonna be around.
And you're upset because you didn't make your best friend cry?
Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!
That sounds like my first bike. My dad gave me his old one.
No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned.
...Quality, right, great.
Why would our guy be a weirdo?
Yes, yes she is. Didnt I memo you on this? See, after I let her go, err, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen-nen, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flan.
Why did you look at me when you said that?
Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with a woman, y'know, I know where everything goes, it's always nice. But I need to know what makes it go from nice to, "My God! Somebody's killing her in there!"
Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate.
Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.
Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon. I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?
We're flipping Monica's mattress.
You hear that? We're the guys.
No, it's... fancier than a pimple. Look Ross, why don't you just go see a...
All right, I'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like that I'll lie.
How about Joey... Pepponi?
Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so...
Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?
I hate this thing!
Are we in London?
Hey, come on, give me a break, I'm out on a limb here.
No!
Ok, this could be tough.
The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.
Wait a minute, I can't give this to her.
So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law & Order?
Well she totally called me on it, okay. She said, 'cut it out, get real', and I did.
Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area.
My-Oh my God!
Hm-hmm.
Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
What are you doing tonight?
No, our guy is just a floating head.
Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning. We're not working out, it's over.
Then why didn't you tell me to do that?!!
See, I'm not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?
Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay, I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth.
Too bad, she's leaving.
What do you think she's just gonna sit there quietly? You don't think she's gonna want to make a toast? You don't think she's gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!
Do you have to be a Century 21 real-estate agent to get to wear those really cool jackets?
Daddy. All right look, here's the story. Well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was really steamy. So I take off my glasses and that's when in happened.
Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first!
So you don't think I have a, a quality?
Okay, well tonight's the big night.
Ah, well, maybe thats, ah, because youre getting a big raise.
All right, all right, I'll go sleep with my girlfriend. But I'm just doing it for you guys.
Don't worry.
Oh my God. What is th... it's like a guy never lived in here. Look, you've got to be careful. This girl thing is dangerous. It's spreading already.
No, not us... Us!
Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can't just stare through the peep hole for three hours! You're gonna get peep eye!
No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when Snoopy falls. . . funny.
That was an obvious joke, and I didn't think of it. Why didn't I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done!
I figured I'd buy those. Pat, I'd like to buy a vow.
Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon...
Well, like father, like son.
No-no, I don't think you heard me. Are you ready to party?!
The sheep.
Oh, right, well yeah, I graduated fourth grade and realized I wasn't a pimp.
That's not specific to girls.
Honestly? Me too.
Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.
Why am I looking?
So what are you gonna do?
I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish...
Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!
Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.
I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.
Hi, honey! I'm home!
Bye!
She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!
Fancy guest.
Joey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey!
How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago?
Hi there.
Nice shooting!
Which I may say, right now, is out of control.
Hey I didn't kill your fish. Look Eddie... Would you look at what I'm doin' here. That can't be smart. So we're just gonna take this guy right off ya and put him here in Mr. Pocket. Tangellon?
Right here!
Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
Okay. Listen-listen, we're not gonna have to walk this way the entire time are we?
Oh.
What? What can't you do?
All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?
It's a nickname, I'll explain later.
Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.
No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!
Uh, Julie.
Two. This photographer, who seemed really dull. And this actor guy, who I'm not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone 'Chandler Bing,' he said 'Whoa-whoa, short message.'
Surprise!!
Batman has a utility belt!
Oh.
...The second guy.
Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!
No, because you're not a grandmother!
So, are we going in there?
I don't think so.
I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!! You are surprisingly strong!
Well, you could also give back the money you owe me.
By me?
I got caught up and work, but I'm quitting tomorrow.
Oh my God, the air purifier! Ross's air purifier! All I heard through 4 years of college was
Monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing! Okay? It's crazy. {Finally! The voice of reason.} I mean, just impress Gary and Phoebe we have to go upstairs and have sex over and over and I'm saying no to this, why? Get your coat.
Well?
So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?
You slept with the stripper?
Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.
When did I try to give you money?
I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
Why to save your dignity my man.
Okay, what is in here? Rocks?
Oh, hey guys!
Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom.
Oh uh, o, OK.
I have some moves.
Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party.
Oh, you don't want me on the trip?
Okay. Good one.
No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.
If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom.
No, I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it.
Phoebe, are you having a heart attack?!
Oh, just a bit of shopping. How've you been?
Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding...
We are switching back, right now!
Oh my God!
Next time you snore, I'm rolling ya over!
I don't know.
Hey, look, you're in trouble either way! Okay? If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she's gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go.
Oh they didn't want to come!
Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys.
Mm! Night Gar'!
Ok.
You know, I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go out with her again?
Okay.
What?
No-no-no, y'know what? I really shouldn't have said that you were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn't cool. And if it makes you feel any better, I've had a really lousy day.
It's exactly like it sounds.
No!
Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldn't have, but it did. I mean I like her, I don't want to stop seeing her, but every so often it's like 'Hey, y'know what, where's your leg?' I mean I'm the smallest person in the world aren't I? I'm the smallest person in the world.
They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit.
Why would the baby creep me out?
Hey.
But then later that night...
So, basically just a Chinese guy.
I called you fat?! I don't even remember that!
Hi!
She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.
No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate, Momma's Little Bakery. I feel terrible, I'm a horrible, horrible, horrible person.
That was so unlikely. Well, let's get married! I guess.
Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. I got her machine.
What are you guys doing?
Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now.
That's laughter.
Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?
And protected them from a tornado?
Hey.
So uhh, how's the palace?
This is not a sign!
Okay.
There it is! So what're you gonna do?
Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?
Listen, I just wanted to apologize about this afternoon and the whole massage thing. Y'know? I-I really like 'em.
Forget it! Okay, I'm not giving up my bachelor pad for some basketball seats!
What are you guys doing together?
Pierce Brosnan?
I can't believe we're doing this.
Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for tonight, right?
What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
Thanks.
Huh.
Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay, it's probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women... So, as of 4 o'clock tomorrow, I'm either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.
What if Joey were president?
Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?
Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!
An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didn't wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!
So, thanks for having me over! Rach. Pheebs.
You're welcome.
Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she's-she's smart, and funny, and gets you.
So I guess it's just uh, you and me then.
Oh yeah! Yeah! Don't worry about me, I'll be fine!
I'm out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?
Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life.
We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.
Okay.
Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?
You don't want to be guys, you'd be all hairy and wouldn't live as long.
Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personality-Well, they're all back! Y'know? And she's picked up like nine new ones!
I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. So please wake up so we can do it right!
Well it's kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that he's not real.
Oh-ho, come here. Listen, you are one of my favourite people and the most beautiful woman I've ever known in real life.
What equity investments?
Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?
Yeah.
Ok, all right, look. Let's get logical about this, ok? We'll make a list. Rachel and Julie, pros and cons. Oh. We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and I can use different colors for each column.
Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.
Okay man.
I can't do that.
Oh okay, I'll-I'll try.
I had one.
Yeah, check out the ring.
Thank you! All right, I gotta go unpack.
Oh.
That's right my friend. It's time for...
Two.
All right, there's a nuclear holocaust, I'm the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
I can't remember which sister.
Yeah, it's beautiful.
So how's it going there in Financial Services?
Two fours.
OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on that. Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a hundred times, I promise I will never take it off my. . . wrist. But if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just uh, you stay in there.
Okay.
Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen.
Hi! Hi! You're crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.
And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.
Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard you'd be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!
That's true!
I would but mine doesn't fit. The pants are a little tight.
Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.
Trust me, you don't want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.
Hey!
Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we've got reservations at Ja George.
You-you-you don't wanna give into the fear.
Now wait a minute, I claimed you in the name of France four years ago.
Okay, let's play my game now.
Like, when you're cooking a steak.
Ow, no 'woo-hooing,' no 'woo-hooing.'
No, look, that's it, it's over, I want you out, I want you out of the apartment now.
I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!
I'd like to toast, Ross and Emily. Of course, my big toast will be tomorrow at the wedding, so this is kind of my little toast or Melba toast, if you will. Okay. I known Ross for a long time. In fact, I knew him when he was going out with his first girlfriend. And I thought things were going to work out for him.. Until the day he over inflated her. Ohh, Dear God..
No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn't take it.
Hey!
Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.
That's patio furniture!
Look, I-I'm just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up I'm moving right back in with you!
No.
Yes, yes eight.
Okay! This is it! We're gonna get married!
Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?
Okay, one question.
Y'know what, pretty good.
Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.
I don't know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office.
Yeah, just leave me alone for a while.
No!! Okay!! What's with the third degree?! Why don't you just shine a light in my eyes?!
Really? Right across the street?
OK, now wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen.
Really.
We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.
Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.
There was no fish when she dropped it off.
Well believe it baby!
People do stupid things when they're upset.
Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
Are you hugging the door right now.
They put you in jail?
Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.
I don't know. I just had this weird sense. You know, but that's me. I'm weird and sensitive. Tissue?
Neat. I'm gonna die alone.
Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies.
Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here.
Yeah, all right, I'll play.
Bit country? C'mon in here you roomie.
Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic!
Oh no no no, she's a total wack job. Yeah, she thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Remore.
Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY.
That's not funny.
Would you put that back on?! Monica's gonna be here any minute!
Well, I suppose I'd have to say you!! But, what if we're watching a movie in here?
Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
We have to leave for New York in an hour.
Ah that's a cantelope.
I didn't know you had another level.
See that'll stop when you pick up the phone.
Joey!
So, ahh, how are ya? How ya...How ya... You okay?
So that's the girl you like.
Ho! Ho! Ho!
Well, ye, yes, actually, but, uh, they were my Aunt Edna's, and there were three of us in there.
Right.
Yeah, I think we should see other people.
Yeah?
Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname?
8. 8!
Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?
Work on your music?
I got something for her. It's a book!
I'm not a dropper!
Yes, apparently Stevie and the band are like this.
Oh yeah man. Joey.
I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.
Aah, y'killing me!
What?
Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it.
Yep, pretty much.
Maybe we'll have to listen and see!
He's Greek Orthodox.
No!
Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!
Bad London!
What do you mean?
Well, we could count again.
Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very aware of my tongue...
Yes, you can pass for 19.
Hey!
Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word, "Yippee!" just ignore me.
Oh, it's not important? It's not important?! If it wasn't for a bride's maid you'd be marrying him not me!
Oh-ho, it'll be back. Oh-ho, there's nobody in the room.
Ahhhh.
Hey, look at all the boxes!
Rach, Rach, we gotta settle.
Well, I think it's very brave what you said.
I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay.
I'll be right with you.
You tell me! Maybe, it's because I was just fooling with my ex! Oh no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, that was you!!
The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell.
Hey, you guys! Hey, Ross, quick question for ya. Are you ready to party?
It's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway. Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday?
Okay. Okay. Yes honey, I made it myself. I can't do it. I can't do it. Oh! Oh! A mixed tape! A mixed tape!!
So, are you guys in the movie, or are you just really paranoid.
That's what's weird? Joey, the man's been captain of a cereal for the last 40 years.
Sorry!
I say we go with Careless Whisper.
It's true.
Joey told you about the leg, huh?
Yeah, baby!
Oh that's great! Good for you.
Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold separately.
Oh yes.
See you later.
Santa pants. Santa Claus's pants.
I'm coming over tonight though, right?
Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting.
How did you...know?
Oh, I am no women, but that is one tasty dish.
Sorry, my my thing was in there with me.
All yours babe.
Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class.
Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were licking your face?
You gotta do it, man.
So, let's go.
Y'know, I've had dates like this.
Ohh. Mmm.
Yes.
I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?
So what was it for anyway?
Well, then, I might as well offer to stay.
Oh no-no, I can't do that.
It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!
Jeez, relax! It's not like we're mar-ah-ah!!
Okay.
Oh that's not bad, Pheebs?
You wanna play?
Okay.
Well, it still has to go, right?
Hey!
Your sister Joan is crazy.
So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down.
Call me!
Let me try it on!
No. No. We're not gonna do that, y'know why? Because its not an even trade.
Yeah, I guess it's a little better now.
This coming from the man who couldn't split our 80 dollar phone bill in half.
Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, "Quack, quack!" I'm happy all the time!
Well now you have two. Hey, I am good at math.
That was so lame.
Thank you, Ross.
Okay, hating this.
Okay, how long is this going to go on.
Yes!!
Well, that makes me feel so good.
Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?
Totally.
Hi! Hi. Okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store, the ring you're about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. So, I'm gonna need to have that back. But, in exchange I'm willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring. Ew.
Because I'm in love with Monica!!
Okay, okay. So, should I call her?
Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him.
I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped.
We have heard you play.
What am I gonna do, huh?
Her ankle is what you're watching?
Expect it in 4-6 weeks. Umm, hey, umm, Joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves.
Oh.
You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.
Okay, great.
Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.
So uh, what are you in for?
Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?
Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!
Come on, let me see that smile.
Joey got meat sauce on the banister again!
You do owe me so much. You owe me three thousand, four hundred...
They do me?
Yeah, he's lived here for years, I don't, I don't know what you're talking about man.
Aww!
Pheebs, I don't understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?
Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.
I had about a mugful in this lovely 'I got boned at the Museum of Natural History' mug.
Hello, children!
All right.
All right, fine, you know what, we'll both sit in the chair. I'm soooo, comfortable.
Nope! Because I'm not your boyfriend. Hey Pheebs, how did it go?
For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.
So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it take for the roller skating thing to happen.
Oh, and Ive got Earth Science, but I'll catch you in Gym.
Uh-oh.
Do you want me to call?
Yes!
You're a little high maintenance.
Hey, you guys!
Ross-Joey, Joey-Ross.
Well maybe he was nervous.
I'm up! I'm up, I've gotten up now! Anybody ah, want anything?
Joey! Joey!!
Alright, one of you give me your underpants.
He's finally happy with that and walks away.
Yes!!
At a fake game!!
Wow, Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I. He was right. Would you listen to that?
How long have we been home?
Hey! You okay?
Well, aren't we Mr. "The glass is half empty."
Too?
I've had a very long, hard day.
He took my joke, he took it.
What check thing?
Oh yeah! Okay, let's play again. What do you got?
All right, buddy!
Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?
Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done! And you said it was gonna be fun! Which it kinda is. Also, you said there would be other guys here. There are no other guys here!
I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
I didn't realize that.
Oh, good!
No! No! No! I just kissed her.
Ohhh.
What?
No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
Ah sure. What's in 'em?
And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place....
What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?
Well, we're really not that close. Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.
Noo! Oh, it's okay, it's okay, baby, baby, baby.
Yes, it is.
Uh, no Pheebs. What's it look like?
Okay.
Phoebe.
Okay, for the last time. It's not named for each individual man.
No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous!
Okay, bye! Oh my God!!
Eh..., I don't, I don't know.
Hey!
I made a...
Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.
Wow, this is serious. Ive never known you to pay money for any kind of capade.
Alright, alright, alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!
No we didn't!
Guys, guys, guess who I am?!
You just said... Of course you're my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though?
Ho-oh, he's gonna get some! Of the glare from the streetlight out of his apartment. Y'know so umm, he's closed the drapes there so he can have a nice, pleasant conversation with your little sister. Well, I'm off to bed!
Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?
Because sometimes, Phoebe after you sleep with someone, you have to kill the fish.
Stop it! We're doing this! Let's do it!
I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.
Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?
It's throwing and catching!
Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, 'cause I wanna trade for her.
Alright, here's ten.
So, whaddya say boys, should I call him? Well, ya know what they say. Ask your slippers a question... you're going crazy.
It's like this, me, no jokes.
Hey, man. What's up?
...And then he burst into flames.
Eh?
No.
Okay, I don't sound like that. That is so not true.
Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."
Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.
Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?
You have to pick your moments.
...in you, my endless love. My endless love.
Or Casey.
That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night.
Marry me.
I told you I should not wear this color.
Okay, but after that, we're shootin' some pool.
Yep! And! A beautiful woman agreed to go out with me. Joey wanted to ask her out, but uh, she picked me.
Hey.
What did you do when they found out?
What?!
Okay, well I won't uh, worry about this anymore then.
Ross, ten o'clock.
Okay, here's the thing. We're gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that you're drunk.
Uh Joe, when it's one o'clock in the morning and you don't come by? That's okay!
I said, "Geez, relax Monnnnn."
Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane?
Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players.
The guy was hammered, okay? There's no way, you look like Ross's mother.
Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
All right, how about we, how 'bout we sell it.
Well it's not Sean Penn.
I'm the ruptured spleen.
We actually missed it.
Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's fast!
Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess something.
So, uh, you met someone, huh?
I'll get you the Cliff Notes.
Well, that's the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I'll be in Cuba.
Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.
Hey.
Really? Okay, so...
Is this because of the burrito thing?
Peter Parker.
Do you realize you get louder each week?
You've got it.
And to you too, Helen.
You know it?
Hey, will you grab me a cruller? Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!
Yes! Good thing we have that, 'Not in New York' rule.
Yeah?
Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!
Hey.
I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!
Oh, I think I have the cash.
Where did you hear it from before?
Whoa, snowing out there?
Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?
Well where... Where did she go?
Bye.
Hey.
It was my racquet.
Thank you! Today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like it was no big deal.
So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?
Right on! Oh! Uh, but, don't take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez.
What are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes?
Is that a swing?
Okay, okay, I tell you what. You roll another hard eight; and we get married here tonight.
Okay, it's just weird! Okay? I don't want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I need...I don't know what I need. I need a walk.
Dangerous Liaisons.
Okay.
Robert's coming out.
Ahh, you know what? That is....Who wouldn't want you?
Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.
What are you doing?
Ehh, you're just liquored up.
Oh, okay. Send her in.
I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.
Helen drinks. Will you marry me?
Really?!
Oh yeah, yeah! Look what I got, look what I got. See, she's fully dressed, right?
So she's just waiting over there for ya?
You really think that is what he meant?
Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? What're you lookin' at me for? He's the one who wants to boff the maniac.
It's a big company, I don't-if you-I...
No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?
No!! You can't!!
Ring dammit, ring!
Morning.
Goodnight.
Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?
I just get mad when Rachel doesn't remember where we're going.
I used to undress my cousin Glenn.
Oh, you dont know. Helen, could you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinders raise?
All right look. Penis schmenis. We're all people.
Okay.
When'd you meet her?
Petrie, right, right. Okay, some people gonna be working this weekend.
Oh yeah, that looks good.
Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants. If y'know what I mean.
Oh, that's-that's okay, no problem.
Not really.
I know, I still am one of these.
Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in Ross's situation?
Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.
Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea. We might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon.
Yes, yes, we had the sex.
And I'm blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it, "Oh Chandler, I just lost myself in the moment."
Monica said wedding.
What?!
Oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! No-no, vomit tux!
Oh no-no-no, you don't want to do that, then you're gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.
Listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. I'm buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night.
Unbelievable
007?! This is James Bond's tux?!
Oh, this is horrible, it's just horrible.
You look beautiful mom. You look beautiful too dad. I love you both. I'm so glad you here.
There are seven?!
Y'know, you'd think I would've.
I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.
Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend.
Because he thinks I slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.
Before!!
So?
Yes, we do. But, we have to change first.
Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
Treeger's snaking the shower drain.
You are really frightening me.
Noho. Who doesn't they like me?
But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, y'know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, she'd be surprised!
Wow! Just like in the pros.
Ah!
Smooth.
Oh come on guys, it's not like I moved to Europe! I just moved across the hall! And we would have you over all the time if it weren't for Monica's allergies. You're right, I could never lie to you. She hates you. Should I get that? Hello? Uh no, Joey's not here right now. Can I take a message? Yeah, okay so the audition has been moved from 5:00 to 2:30? Okay great. Bye.
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!
What happened? What happened?!
Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?
You're kidding, no!
And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something. Okay? Something huge!
Hey! Everybody at work loved you last night!
Okay. I wanna quit the gym.
Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?
Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.
Yeah!
I gotta check out this hot girl! There she is!
You look good.
What do we use to split it?
Bye bye.
Oh my God!
Hey.
Well, Ross and Emily aren't gonna use it.
I'm tellin' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain.
I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.
Yeah, I wouldn't know having missed everything.
Is this why they don't like me or why you don't like me?
So, how many have you sold so far?
Oh my God!
Why?
Nothing.
All right, now look at her and tell me she doesnt look exactly like her sister.
She's not gonna say no.
I was not flirting.
Yeah umm, they're called wallets.
It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon! She's-she's gonna kill me.
Oh, good! Good! Do you guys know how to get a chick out of a VCR?!
No! No! No! No--one can beat me.
Ahhh.
Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?
Will you marry me?
Might wanna try Joseph.
And the moment of joy is upon us.
Yeah, I coulda counted to three like four times without all this 'two' talk.
Uh-Oh. It's Isaac Newton, and he's pissed.
Okay.
Wait, wait, wait.
Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didn't tell my girlfriend that you love her?
I don't care! I don't care!!
Hey!
Condoms, dude!
We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?
Yeah, and not that you would, but I wouldn't hang out with...all the guys in my office.
No-no, I mean what, what's this about your new place?
Okay... ..whose turn is it?
Look, I'm not saying that you should magically forgive me! But you're not perfect! You've made some errors in judgment too!
I can check that for ya.
You can't tell, but I'm trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!
Why is your family Ross?!
If this is the way all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a problem.
To Monica!
I didn't know it was a big secret.
Do you happen to know what I'm going to say?
Okay, okay, a little announcement, I just want everyone to know that the position of my best man is still open! And uh, so is the position of the bride.
Does it matter?!
So-You got in voluntarily?!
Okay, look I need your help, I don't know what to get her for Valentine's Day.
Hey!
Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that's what we're gonna do.
Joey, Joey. Hey, some girl just walked up to me and said, 'I want you Dennis,' and stuck her tounge down my throat. I love this party.
I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick!
Well you did pull his hair.
All right. "My husband is sleeping with his secretary." She's married!
What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the... OK, OK, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table.
No-no-no-no, this is bad! It's bad! This is bad!
Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.
We can't do that that's insane. I mean 'A' he could wake up and 'B' y'know, let's go for it.
The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
Well, come on, I've been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.
Okay, bye!
Bye, Pheebs!
Excuse me...
What?
Okay. Joey, trade lives with me!
It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it's bad enough that I'm in love with my roommates girlfriend-which by the way, I think she knows. Because every time we're in the room together there's this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when I've seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she's smooth! Smooth!
Really?
Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor.
Ooooh.
It's my joke.
Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land.
No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading.
So ah, isn't a bit cold out for shorts?
Damn those robots, they're supposed to be our faithful servants!
And then Joey remembered something.
You really like it?
Yes!
What? Nothing.
All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right now!
Oh, no, no. Nina... ..she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all.
You still can't stand her can you?
Totally worth it!
You think we're ready for something like that?
So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, we're on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.
No-no-no-no. Hey!
I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.
I know!
Wow!
You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76. Amouz-bouche?
No, it was me. I'm sorry. I over reacted.
I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.
So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.
No you don't-get it in black, not brown.
Yeah! All right! You go first.
I'm goin' home.
All right, we haven't had sex yet. Okay, what's the big deal? Y'know? This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to the next level.
And I just want a million dollars!
Excuse me?
Uh, The Wheatsheaf.
Nono, just you.
Guys?
Yeah, Ross can't go so it's between my friend Eric Prower who has breath issues and Dan with the poking. 'Did you see that play? Do you want some more beer? Is that Spike Lee?'
Crazy bitch.
All right! Fine! But it's just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I don't want you setting me up with anybody ever again!
Uh, yeah, I just got my pick-up sticks back from the shop. Bring your nerves of steel.
Wow that's actually pretty cool.
Fun's over!
Hi there!
Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!
Hi!
Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller!
Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.
What are you crazy? That's a baby!
Hhhiiii.
Why can't I tell them that we live together?
Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but I'm...
Oh, you're-you're going?
Yeah, we're gonna go.
Fine.
...Poulet passes it up to Leetch!
She said she'd call me.
Oh that's too bad.
Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, y'know I've always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.
Of course it is. Wow-whoa!
Okay, a little announcement, a little announcement. I've decided that my best man is, my best friend Gunther!
And, we're done with the yogurt.
Yeah.
Yes I did, and I think you should do it.
The one that doesn't.
Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know..
I'm still on London time, does that count?
If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do.
Well he doesn't have to know! It's not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.
I'm not your garbage man. I'm your mailman.
You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different.
Then...who did?
Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?
Ohh, that's a good one.
That's a pig.
Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep.
The mean guys at the coffee house took my hat.
Well, thanks man. Now I can get my pony.
I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I doing Ebony and Ivory.
No-no-no-no, I've supported you one hundred percent and I want to prove that to you in person!
I am totally picturing you with all those women!
Alright, whoever this is, stop calling me! It's been six months! It's not funny!
Not once did we do that.
Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.
Oh, you're right I, I should play in the hay. Forget about the fact that I just dropped 400 dollars to replace a bracelet that I hated to begin with. Bring on the hay.
Hey.
Monica! This is the Men's room! Isn't it?
We don't know Bob, ok? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy.
Hey, big guy, game time.
Ah, you're still just a little fat girl inside aren't you?
Y'know what would work?
You win.
Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!
Oh man!
Yeah, we were gonna give fifty, but if you guys gave more, we don't wanna look bad.
Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.
You're right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.
Come on! I was there! I know he's the love of your life.
Oh, ok, 'cause we never do that.
This is gonna be soo cool, dude, we never party anymore!
Well, where's the logic in that?!
Then don't leave me!
Hey.
Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.
Ah-ha, you're not the boss of me. Yeah, you are! Ooh, saucy.
Well, I guess thats why they call it psychology, sir.
The meaning of the box is three fold. One , it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two , it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three , it hurts!
Yes. Okay, there's this one guy, Patrick, I think you're gonna like him, he's really nice, he's funny, he's a swimmer.
Yeah baby!
Okay we have to do something about your breath.
Okay, now when you come back I hope you remember that, that chick is not a toy!
I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesn't matter, I still wind up with this little cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. It's so annoying. Does it bug you?
That's what they'll call us.
Rachel, wait, wait.
Yes, how 'bout a verse of Killing Me Softly. You're gonna sneeze on my fish, aren't you?
Joey, a woman just stuck her tounge down my throat, I'm not even listening to you.
No!
Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot more interesting.
Yeah, we're gonna have to get you out of those shoes.
You know I think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh, you know, isn't capable of that emotion.
Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little Blackjack?
Hey.
See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.
Yeah!
Well don't you see how gross that is? I mean that's like you using my toothbrush. You used my toothbrush?
...it was like the Algonquin kids table.
Something else I might have said?
Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's lunch, who? Ross Geller's lunch, please don't take me. Okay?
And I'll be using his dead body as a shield.
Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!
How do Monica and Phoebe know?
Okay.
Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.
Right.
You're shooting with Althea?!
Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We have switched places! I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational screw up! And now we're back.
Nina? Nina. Nina. Nina.
Oh my God!
Not yet.
Oh come on!!
Okay, ah umm, ah, a 8. Ah, a 6?
Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot.
Big bullies!!
Are you looking at naked tribe's women?
One. . . two. . . two and a half. OK, just show me one of them.
Okay, Pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a little... Y'know, it didn't have any... It-it, well it blew. So, we thought, that this afternoon that we would all go away for the whole weekend to, Atlantic City!
Well it couldn't have been worse. A woman literally passed through me. OK, so what is it, am I hideously unattractive?
Hey. Hold on a second. Huh?
Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about.
Well, we haven't exactly met, we just stayed up all night talking on the internet.
We still have porn.
Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?
Oh you got a wedding dress? That's great!
Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?
Na, forget it, it's probably stripped and sold for parts by now.
Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!
Yeah.
All right, well I'm gonna put my sweats back on.
No, you didn't get me!! It's an electric drill, you get me, you kill me!!
What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.
No! Look, I don't cry! It's not a big deal! Okay?!
At this?!
Why haven't you told them?!
Yeah, it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just doesn't say 'cool' anymore.
He's right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want.
All right!
I don't think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in. Draw!!
The actor playing Mac couldn't do it, they needed to see you at 2 o'clock.
Yes, yes it is, short story, that I was writing.
Sweet mother of all that is good and pure.
Well, I did not know that.
Mrs. Braverman must be out.
Janice, you're--
Oh, my, god!
Well they were chair-shaped cows. They never would have survived in the wild.
See? Here we go.
Okay.
Hey.
Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.
The hot chicks?
Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
Me too!
Oh yeah?
What?
All right, I'm off to see your dad.
Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?
Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.
I tell people secrets. It makes them like me.
Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!
Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.
Well... we-we do. You can only eat Tic Tacks in even numbers.
Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room.
Hey, this isn't like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!
Hi.
Hey ladies! What are you in here for?
Well where did she go?
You guys ready fore the movies?
Alright look Ross I'll give you 50 dollars for your underpants.
Well, you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads.
I bet he can.
That's a mailman! That's our mailman! Hi. How are ya?
What's going on?
What? What?
All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her, it's over.
Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I get to have sex with the star of the play!
Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?
Hey! Honey, can I ask you a question about the Valentine's Day gifts?
Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!
Hi, how are ya?
A pharmacist.
So, you feel like a dad yet?
She's shhing me! It's my phone and she's shhing me!
Okay, but now see you're crying!
Monica...
Yeah, let's just forget it.
You don't have to stop having fun just because I'm here. Kathy didn't cheat on all of you. Well, except you.
Yeah, I'd love to but I've tried that so many times they won't even let me in the store anymore.
I'm a little busy here Paul.
Oh well, that's uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!
Hey!
You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller! The eyesore from the Liberace house of crap!
It's a beautiful thing.
Um-mm, yeah right!
How is that worse?!
Hey! How'd it go?
The spoon. You licked and-and you put. You licked and you put.
What?
No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married."
Hey.
Wait a minute, all jokes aside? I didn't agree to that!
But we don't do that.
Yeah, but I'm, I'm so much faster...
I just wan't to...
Hey, look, Phoebe I wanted to meet her in person too, okay, but she's married, she has a husband.
He's right. Nobody's gonna benefit, and you're just gonna hurt her.
Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?
With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.
Okay!!!!!
You know that thing, when you and I talk to each other about things?
No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.
Hello-dillillio!!
Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped.
Oh, y'know, y'know what Pheebs?
What, no, "Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?"
Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number.
No, he visited a little town south of throw up. So what was Phoebe's secret?
Hey.
Well yeah! But now that I know that you're having these thoughts, I'm back to panic, anxiety, and uh I'm definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink.
Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor.
All right, but you can't use that again for a whole year. I'm in.
Die Hard still great!
Hey.
Well you know, we got to talking and uh, he said he needed a place and I had a spare room.
Uhh, no.
Okay now it doesn't matter which one you choose, y'know? It's completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself.
Um, we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for something...
Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us.
Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?
Oh, okay, thanks.
Rachel, could I see you for a moment?
Done.
Oh good, I was hoping that would come up.
Okay before we start the celebration, Monica has to go put on her party dress.
What gay thing?
Cry?! I just found a talking puppy, I'm rich!
But we should take it.
Well, Ross and Emily aren't gonna use it.
Well you might if it were anything like 7!
Oh, I don't know man. I haven't talked to her in like ten years.
Yeah, well, I don't dance at weddings.
Why are you screaming and hugging?
Why wouldn't they be happy?
What?
Hey Eddie, you uh, wanna play some foosball?
So, I guess this is over.
So?!
Aahhuuhhh....
Oh my God!
No. No, see when I first meet somebody it's uh it's mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating.
Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?
I'm sorry!
Yeah, that'd be much worse than being 28, and still working here.
Hey, whoa-whoa! What's she like?
Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
Hello! Little ones.
Ah, I don't know, you tell me. Anything you ah, wanna tell me, because, if you ah, you should, if you, you would, tell me.
Yeah!
Well I like both eggs equally.
Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?
What?
You mean this.
I'll teach ya! Come on, come on, it's really easy and really, really fun.
Y'know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?
Well, it's like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake.
So are we...friends again?
Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!
Jeez, what a baby.
Oh no.
She's just doing her job!
Ross?
Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?
Nope, not under here!
He's a he?
Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?
Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away.
What?
Hey.
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You're not talking about Chuckles University?!
Oh, it's not just that, I would be England's most powerful weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty's secret service. A man who fears no one; with a license to kill. Would Monica let me wear this?
Hey, we're having some fun now, huh, Ross? Wanna do another one, huh Russ? OK... eleven letters, atomic element number 101... ends in ium.
What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
Yeah. Thanks for making me do this.
Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.
No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?
And we're done with the chicken fried rice.
Yeah all right, so we'll hang out.
No I-I-I'm fine.
Oh my God! Someone's killed Square Man!
No.
Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.
We are bad people.
More coffee over here, please!
Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.
Yeah, I'm not in that.
Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian life partner?
Nah, Monica's watching some cooking show. Come on, I don't want to miss when they were skinny.
Am not!
Right.
Ok.
You want me to wear your panties?
Twenty-three!! Seventy-four!! You wanna go shotgun?
You're not a dad. You're not a dad.
Doesn't know, "Hello." But she knows Capricorn One.
You built a fort didn't ya?
Wait a minute, wait a minute, you don't like the guy Rachel's dating? Well, that's odd.
All right!!
Arghhhhhh!!
It's 6:00.
Oh, oh, c'mon in.
Oh, how well you know me...
Waaa-aaah.
Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?
Scared? Happy?
But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night. I mean it was, it was like when we first started living together.
Monica's wasted.
Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay.
Oh, what the hell is that?
Monica's a little drunk.
I can't believe you don't know what I do for a living!
He's being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!
No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?
Is that what you're thinking about right now?
Hey Joey, do you wanna play football or you wanna.. Hi, I'm Chandler.
Really.
You, you are gonna love this.
Well, not at first.
Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I'm saying?
No I didn't!
Says here that a muppet got whacked on Seasame Street last night. Where exactly were around ten-ish?
Well, the heart wants what it wants. I'll see you later.
Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape.
I do not hate Ross!
Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?
Tonight? You-you didn't say it was going to be at nighttime.
Bye.
Nice camoflauge man, for a minute there I almost didn't see ya.
When was the last time you saw her wear it?
I'm fine.
Yes, every single one of them.
Well, 'cause she came back the third summer and she'd gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow...
Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods.
I wanna quit the bank!
Are you funny?
What?
Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!
Okay!
No, no I just ah, didn't do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don't deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.
Hey-hey!
Ok, you can have it.
Okay.
What is the matter with you ?!?
You left a shoe here?!
Okay, we owe you a present.
Okay!
Wow! You look just like your son Mrs. Tribbiani!
Yes, Bunny?
No.
Not that big a deal? There...there was touching of things.
Who are those people?
Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!
We've got to do something!
Here it is! Here it is!
Where is she, Where is she? Oh, hey, I have a question, where is she?
Yes, but I feel like I've really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think we're two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.
And I just want a million dollars!
So apparently we just don't pay for food anymore. Do you see what I see?
Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad.
I can save you time ladies, I'm right here.
What?
So you're just, kinda rubbing it on yourself?
Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.
I can't figure out what to make Monica.
Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!
Hey!
Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?
It must take you forever to find your keys.
That's ok.
Do you want me to be afraid of you?
Well, it's not like I went to Spain. I went to the bathroom, you knew I was coming back.
You put your fist through the wall?
Okay! Okay! Okay! I'll do it! Oh God, I thought... Wait a minute, I-I can do this. I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. And if you'll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. Monica, will you marry me?
I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
Oh yeah, that sounds great. Oh, and listen, it's, it's gonna be....
Sorry!
Okay, great.
OH...MY...GAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? You didn't tell her we were getting married, did you?
Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him. Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on.
Well, actually it's a hockey team, so it's angry Canadians with no teeth.
Hey!
Eddie, do you remember yesterday?
Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles.
Actually, this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of her favorite book.
Y'know, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know you're up there every night, you're naked, touching, kissing.
Hey! Happy birthday.
Well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families.
Hey Ross, I was wondering if... Oh my God!! Where are all the men???
So uh, what did this woman look like?
Awwwww!! Awwwwwww!!!
Wait a minute! I have a date tomorrow night.
Well, y'know I'm 29. I mean who needs a savings account.
And I am not blah, I am a hoot!
No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
Ross, it's just a sandwich!
Pudo aver sido General Tso!
Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice.
Okay.
What?
Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.
Yes. Right where?
Alright, OK, alright. But if we put on spandex and my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm goin' home.
Thank you Helen, that'll be all.
Hey.
Score.
Ohhhhh!
Well ah, ........y'know.
Hey, how's the first day goin'?
...He's in.
Yeah, I've always hated that Howie.
All right, rock on.
Well, there you go.
Hey.
Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign.
Hey, you feelin' better?
...And what did you bring?
Sounds great.
Thank you, Mister Drunken Gambler! Okay, you get this and uh, we get the biggest suite in the place! Wait-wait-wait-wait! We get the biggest suite in the place.
Good-good-good-good.
Okay, a quick one. Come on hug it out. Oh hey! There you go. Okay.
Fine!
When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.
Hey Rach, now that you're working at Ralph Lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?
You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.
Thanks
Well, there you are! So what did Elizabeth say?
We're not gonna talk about girth are we?
Uh, Yes. Yes. Ive just been going over your data here, and little thing, youve been post-dating your Friday numbers.
Yeah.
Hey!
Yeah okay, I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them I mean, is it okay if they come visit?
I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer.
I don't know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.
What?
No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?
Oh, she's goin' somewhere.
No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who's going like this...
All right. I thought about it and maybe you're right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.
Could I borrow it?
Chelsea.
You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool! I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing. Anyway we're talking about your dream. I love you. Your dream?
Y'know I think we should invite them.
Oh, she's got you running errands, y'know, picking up wedding dresses... Wah-pah!
Hell is filled with people like you.
Hey Rach!
Well, I'm so confused as to what we've been doing so far...
What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.
I mean, if it were me, I think I'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all.
Yeah?
Oh my God.
Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbianI don't think we need a third...
I'm only going to pretend I'm moving to Yemen, it's the only way I can get rid off her.
No, I have a great idea for a present for her.
Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
Yuck!
You are totally and completely 100% forgiven.
C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by "No thanks, it's late."
Still terrified, I'll take care of it. No problem.
What's wrong with you?
Refill?
How can you not be wearing any underwear?
Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke-(Yelps in
We used them as pillows when we went camping.
Oopsey, missed it!
Taste it.
Okay!
Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?
Sounds like a date to me.
Bad dream?
Tuna or egg salad? Decide!
Oh man! I am so excited-I may vomit!
Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex!
Games and stuff.
Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.
You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross did? He stole my joke. You know what? I'm going to get a joke journal. Y'know? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.
Yeah.
I'm sorry we, we don't have your sheep.
Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, I'll be your boyfriend.
What Richard thing?
Sounds like a fun party.
You think I should?
What've you been up to?
You'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and I'm gonna end up alone. Will you promise me something? When you're married, will you invite me over for holidays?
It's gonna be ok. You know that?
Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment.
Oh, okay, time's up!
Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!
Pregnant Woman Slays Four?
Hi, Nina. Come on in.
It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.
I still can't believe they promoted her to lieutenant.
No, no, no, no, no, no No. Monica, it's Sunday morning. I'm not running on a Sunday.
That was amazing!
Sure, I'll do it with ya.
All right.
Sure, everybody loves a kidder.
Yeah all right. Okay, good night guys.
Sorry.
Hey.
Ground control to Major Tom! Commencing countdown...engines...on!
Please, don't take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!
You're kidding.
Me too.
Okay, don't say anything, you might scare it away.
It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.
Oh, so you're going with the teacher, huh?
I don't want him to tell this story for years.
Knock, knock.
No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we're up at the altar and I'm like this.
All right.
Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!
This is unbelievable. Its been like a half an hour. If this was a cartoon, youd be looking like a ham right about now.
Hi.
Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?
Cookie?
Yeah! You?
So ah, whatcha watching?
Oh great!
You are beautiful.
Okay, look, I'm gonna have to ask you all to leave.
Monica and I almost got married last night.
Take whatever you want, just please don't hurt me.
Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!
Yeah.
I'm afraid I might just be.
What?
Whoa, whoa, prom night flashback.
Oh my God! Play!
Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store we've been too and I can't find the perfect ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! It's a beautiful selection.
Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I don't care!
It's Clint! Clint!
Yeah so, Tuesday?
Oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?
Hey.
No, ten o'clock.
Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?! No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowers-Think of the money we'll save!! We're not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our wedding be bigger please?
Oh, good, Joey's home now.
Hey, check out that girl! She is really hot!
Ben! Ben! Ben!
This is going in your book?
I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.
It's Thursday! How was the audition?!
Hmmm, that's very cool.
Tyrannosaurus!
You know, this is actually good, because if we ever lose Ross, we have a spare.
I'm right here!
So, rocks.
Good-bye muscles!!
Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.
Please?
I KNEW IT!!!!
Hey!
Then I got all needy and clingy.
"So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"
Whoa, she's pretty.
Who's number two? One of the more difficult games sewer workers play.
Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you're my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again.
What a great apology! And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!
Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut...
You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college, Ross used to wear leg warmers!
Okay. Here's a question you never have to ask. My dad just called and wanted to know if he could borrow one of your pearl necklaces.
Stunning entertainment center. Fine, fine Italian craftsmanship.
You're building a post office?
Hey that's what I tell girls about me.
That's so funny, because I think I just did!
Hey, shut up!! You're not my real Mom!!
Okay, good luck with that.
Hey, it's me. I know you can't stand to be in the same room as me, so I just thought I'd try and apologize over the phone. All I...
How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?
You mean there's more than one of us.
We were playing poker, alright...
All right, ready?
...Take off their hats!
May I help you?
Just a little bit of sugar.
Hello! One marriage please!
Oh, you know, I would, but that might get in the way of my lying around time.
What?
Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore...
Gotcha!
Wait! You're going out with Kathy!
Hey! So are you enjoying the bike?
No, no, no, I don't, I don't really wanna play.
Yeah, we'll be down in like five minutes.
Yeah, he's made phone calls, written letters, he even came to New York, but I always said I was too busy to see him. Y'know it's all very Cats in the Cradle-I don't want to get into it. Here we go.
You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting.
Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism.
Too many jokes... must mock Joey!
They got a breakfast buffet.
You think?!
Morning.
They don't have those.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!
Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!
Maybe he's calling to say your obsessive and crazy.
Takin' that with you, huh?
Oh-oh.
Yes, he is!
Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!
Whoa, she's pretty.
Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?
Okay.
You just thought of that in there?
When did that happen to you?!
Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?
I don't care, this is our apartment! And they stole-you stole it-our apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice! And I am getting it back right now. I'm getting back right now!
No-no, why don't you hang on to that one.
No!
Hey, how'd it go? How'd she like the gift?
Well okay Jerry, thanks for stopping by.
Well, I-I just didn't think it was funny sir.
A face ass?
That's a bad duck!!! How'd the thing go tonight, Ross?
She was a welder.
Marcel?
I think so.
OK that's not what he was doing. Alright, he was looking for his bus money.
What happened? I'm just eating candy.
Oh no, no, no, no.
I could use the money; it could give me time to write.
Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, "Who's the best of that?" They'd have to go to you.
I can't believe it! We're here!
Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.
Ahhhh-gaaaahhh. Eddie what're you still doin' here?
What about him?
Oh, Satan's minions at work again...
Thank you! Thank you!
Oh yeah? Well, how'd she take it?
Oh!
Oh that's great! Great! Thanks! But that dress I mean it's like yuck! It's terrible! It makes me wanna just rip it right off of you!
Hey!
Oh no thanks. I don't like any thing from my Scottish heritage.
What?
Well, you know Phoebs. I don't know if it's your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day.
Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?
Hey Ross, look what I've got going here.
Hey!
Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax.
Look, I may have jumped the gun here. Um, I just got out of a relationship and I'm not really in a, in a commitment kind of place.
Oh.
Hey!
Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park and hit rocks at...bigger rocks. Hey Rach, do you have a tennis racquet?
Whoa!!!
Okay, so you will meet our guys?
Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesn't mean anything.
Count of three?
I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.
No! No! I don't want him to know we're yet! I'm not sure I'm ready for that. And besides he's not gonna be too happy to see me either.
Well, you...don't look good Joe.
Eddie, I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend.
And what does she have to think about? I love her!
How did you guys find me? I knew I should've hid at the gym!
Ross, a sports car? Wouldn't it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?
Y'know, I can't believe Kathy did this too me. I really, thought that she was the one. I tell you what, from now on I'm never getting out of this chair, ever! Okay? From now on, this chair is the one! You wanna what else is the one? My sweat pants!
Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?
No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.
You must stop!
Are you serious?
Y'know, I-I can't really put a price on that Joe.
I hear ya. But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!
Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when you flirt with a guy you think, "I'm just flirting, no big deal." But the guy is thinking, "Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!"
Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?
Y'know, I'm so glad I picked you to help me with this.
Well, I ended up telling her everything.
Bad London!
Your boyfriend is so cool.
You're welcome. Hey Joey, thanks for parking the car .
Did she freak out?
Okay. You won't believe what Monica's older brother just said to me!
So you're really okay with this?
How do you do that?
Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together.
No, just wanna make sure we're on the same page.
Screw the Knicks!
How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?
Who was it?
That's the stuff!
They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.
Op, foot in a puddle, foot all in a puddle.
Yeah?
Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!
Wouldn't that be Frank the III?
What?!
Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?
Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.
I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?
Chicks don't swim.
That thing, it's a uhh. . . yeah it's, it's a little flashy.
Hey, where you been?
OK.
Ehh.
Oh, that's fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts.
Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big
I happen to know a Fun Bob.
No reason.
So, Joey on Law & Order, you must be very proud!
I have to; he's my best friend, and you're seeing him.
I didn't know that.
Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?
I don't know. I can't--I just, I can't get her out of my head. Y'know? I mean, I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person. I'm a horrible person. No you're not Chandler! We still love you Chandler!
Hey, come on, it's not your fault.
Well is she...
Oh. Y'know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn't because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me 'cause, you're really hot! Is that okay?
Yeah baby!
Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.
Hey!
Yeah. Yes! Yeah.
Oh my God!
I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!
Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didn't get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
I don't know, but don't worry, don't worry, because I know how to take a picture now. Okay, see? Look down , look down, look down...
I know about Monica.
Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.
Okay, so that's it, everybody knows! It's official, we're moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?
Pretty good! I told her.
That's Mr. Girabaldi playing the piano.
I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.
Look, Ross, you have what you want, you're back with Rachel. If you bring this up now you're gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.
Thanks.
Bored and bored!
I am here, on my knees, holding up these couch cushions as a symbol of my sorrow and regret, much like they did in biblical times. Though you may haveth anger now. . .
Yeah okay. Well, what's the next little bit?
Oh what is it honey, you need some tea? Some soup? Oh-ohhhh!
Oh, I see. I thought you just really, really liked your new couch.
No?
Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.
Unwilling to steal from work, interesting.
I hope she throws up on you.
All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
Take off your shirt!
Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats.
We don't know what could make this go away.
Umm, this is nice.
So you didn't mean any of that?!
OK, I don't, I don't mind the last pound. OK, in fact I kind of like the last pound. OK, so don't make me do anything that I'll regret.
Not a one.
Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.
Yeah, come on, it's Ross and Rachel, they've got too.
All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.
Oh, y'know-y'know what, I was looking at it upside down.
OK.
No, no, no, you say that proudly.
All right, y'know what, we've been talking about London too much haven't we?
Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was funny, just not "Archie Comic funny."
I don't know, y'know. What, what, would you do?
Wow, there's my fantasy come true. No, seriously.
Because weddings are a great place to meet women, and when I dance, I look like this...
Hey, it's me.
No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.
Did she call?
No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.
Ok, while Ross is on the phone, everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday.
Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.
So how'd it go?
Hi! How'd it go?
No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today.
Okay.
It still wouldn't be clean. All I want is my freedom.
You mean they like you.
So how'd it go?
Y'know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.
Okay uh, here's the electric bill.
Or what my Father called Thursday night.
Yeah, we're gonna go.
Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too.
Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?
God that is good TV.
The key's stuck in the lock.
We should start with the big stuff. Y'know? That'll be the easiest. Uh, let's start with the couch. I got it.
Sounds like a really bad idea to me.
Okay, hold on. Okay.
I can't belive it.
Uhl..ell. By the way, in case you missed that, that sound was, "Uhl, ell."
This is nuts. This is crazy. She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish tank, and left, end of story.
That's how radio stars escape stalkers.
I'm sorry you're here with me instead of Roger.
Oh-I don't know.
Nooo!! She's really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!
Y'know I'm-I'm really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
Well, maybe you don't marry this one.
No thank you.
Y'think?
You'll get one.
Yes!
Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people.
So you really OK about all this?
Hello!
Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there....
Yes.
Definitely roses. Well, I just think they're a little more weddingy. But Lilies are the clear choice.
How are you feeling?
Hey!
Okay. "So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"
Our trains are on the same track, ok? Yeah, sure, I'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same. Bitter Town. Aloneville. Hermit Junction.
We're not gonna lose to girls.
She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?
Where have you been?
Not fun anymore?
Oh, they said uh, "You don't have insurance here, so stop calling us."
Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.
Well what's the difference? Your eggs aren't here anymore, are they? You took your eggs and you left. You really expect me to never find new eggs?
I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too see me naked.
Morning, Ross.
That's not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.
Well, it sounds kinda stupid... Who's she?
She was not good. Not good.
Well, it's, it's yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it?
Oh, man. I'm sorry, I'm so-so sorry.
I am so, so, so, so sorry!
Here just...take this.
Y'know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?
Veronica. Look, it's got to be Veronica, the girl in the red skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.
I know.
Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side!
Hey, look, we're on that TV thing!
...Dinah?
OK, this one right here is from me.
Chandler.
What?
Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap. Seriously.
My lighter's in there!
Because I'm very happy for him! And you, you lucky dog!
Hey, hey, those guys are takin our stuff!
Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.
All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.
Okay, good-bye. Good-bye.
Well, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still be living with him.
Oh my God.
How is that worse?!
Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'
Well that would be nice. I'll go get the lotion.
Oh! Good for you Pheebs, way to go!
Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, it's gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow I'm conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.
I am mad! But you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well, but I want you to remember that I forgave you.
A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
Whoa ho.
Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats.
Yes, you got something from the Screen Actor's Guild.
Yeah?
Hey, listen, I know I came in late last week, but I slept funny, and my hair was very very &ndash;
Bye, momi-moo.
Please, please, please, don't be mad at me.
No, I got him.
Yeah.
Two!
So take care.
Hey!
Oh, it's awkward. It's awkward. It's awkward.
Oh that's great!
No. No! No! No!
Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head in between 'em.
Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!
OK, let's do it. What?
Why not?! I mean it's just, it's just climbing! It's just, it's just steep!
Call.
This is the New York Times.
You bitch.
I'm not gonna mess it up.
He's not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I'm supposed to do that!
Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!
I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so, so sorry.
Bye.
Oh, yes, could I have one of those.
We said seven!
Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben, will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?
So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?
So y'know, uh, when's he getting back?
Uhh, no.
Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?
I know!!
Oh, hey.
Oh good, okay, I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore. So you win, okay? Here! Pheebs? Flying a jet? Better make it a spaceship so that you can get back to your home planet! And Ross, phone call for you today, Tom Jones, he wants his pants back! And Hornswoggle? What are you dating a character from Fraggile Rock?!
Which smells delicious!
I-I can't believe Jill's gone. I can't help it, I opened a gate.
Well, I'm guessing he wants to do a little dance. . . ya know, make a little love. . . well pretty much get down tonight.
Why?
You want some help.
Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?
No.
Ok.
Hey!
Stripping!
All right! Bring it on, you...
Oh, all right.
Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean.
Atlantic City!
Bye. I can't stand the woman!
What???
Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out.
Thanks.
You okay?
That's just a lot of big talk, y'know.
Whoa-heeeiiiiii-iiiii-ah!! Huh.
There we go!
Forget about her.
Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him! I wanna talk to him!
Hey! How's the boat?!
Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.
Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!
You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?
Oh! Yeah!
Tickets please! That's courtside baby!
Give me it!
I'm not in a meeting. I'm right... Whoops.
Let's go quicker.
What're you kidding? I broke up with her. She actually thought that Sean Penn was the capital of Cambodia.
Your last roommate's kidney?
Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento. You, however have had the love of a woman for four years. Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it! I don't think that was my point!
No. No, I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before.
Never!
Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there.
Hey.
Your tax dollars?
Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?
Nope.
Our baby.
Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!
For the last time no! Get out! Get out, Joey!
No you don't! No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorce another chance.
The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so...
Hey!
Aww, turkey! Aww, giving thanks! Aww!
Couldn't I just say, "This is Ross?"
Uh-oh.
No, there were two.
Are you sure you weren't looking at your hands in a mirror?
Woah, woah, I've put on a little weight?
You mind if I...
It is starting to get dark out there.
Of course, I didn't get to enjoy any of that, because Joanna's such a big, dull dud!
So I got ya something.
Oh no-no-no, that's not-No-no-no!
Nice try.
Okay so you mean no as in, "Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Let's discuss it before we reject it completely."
Who's he huggin'?
Yeah.
Hi, it's me.
Oh hi!
No. How are ya Paul?
No way!
I don't know.
Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
Chandler.
Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac's sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe's friends with Rachel. And that's the trail, I did it!
No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
'Cause it's-it's not his last name.
No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.
I can't smell your sandwich?
Ooooohh!
Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.
Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn't come yet.
Well, I don't have to buy that, "I'm with stupid" T-shirt anymore.
So what happened?
What?
Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights.
Yes!
You can be the best man when I get married.
No no, seriously, Joey's my dad, Monica's my dad. I've even got some dads down at work.
Love her! That's right, I...LOVE...HER!!! I love her!! I love you, Monica.
What?
Are you judging them by their covers? Because you're really not supposed to do that.
Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom.
Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here?
Why not?!
That's totally understandable.
All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this.
Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?
Excuse me, Doug? Hey there sports fan!!
You have no trouble telling time now right?
Do I still call you Ross?
What?! Ow!
An old cookie?
I paid for those tickets!
So uh, what's this thing you're auditioning for?
Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...
Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife.
Okay.
That is amazing.
What's up with the simian?
You know what? I'm not gonna end up like this. I'll see you man.
Hey!
If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?
What are you talking about?
I'm totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they're gonna go to their cast parties and he's gonna try to undermine me. Y'know it'll be like, "So where's your boyfriend, what's-his-name, Chester?" And she'll go, "No-no-no, it's Chandler." And he'll go, "Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!"
Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really. Nothing.
What?!
No.
So whaddya got there Monica?
Yes please.
Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.
Hey.
What?!
Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey.
I think so. Yeah, get off me.
Hey.
Excuse me. Hi.
Yeah, I know, I did that two minutes ago.
That's a plane!
It was the ring!
Well it's just my entire family was run out of Scotland by...Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.
No.
Ah he's a, he's not a big fan of foosball.
Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid's pretzel at them.
Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.
Well, it's because I trust you, you're one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.
So, you uh, you think that Speed Racer guy gets a lot of tickets er?
It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out.
That's what you got me?
Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in 20 minutes! Come on, Joe!
Who the hell is Carl?!
Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio
Oh, hey!
Much sense?!
Oh-oi-ho, yeah!
That's good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths.
Yeah well, I hear the place looks great.
No. He.....he's coming out of his shorts.
Already?!
Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me. So I got you some gifts that I found on the side of the road. Who wants the teddy bear with one leg?
Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.
Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.
Well, you remember Cathy Bates in Misery?
You!
You didn't get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?
Sir, can I ask you to umm, could you...hold out that ring and ask me to marry you?
See, you think it's just a pen, but then you turn it over and it's also a clock.
It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable.
Okay! You don't think I thought of that?
All right, that's it, give me your underwear.
I can't believe she cracked your code!
So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?
What if I had had the guts to quit my job? I'd probably be writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny. But my job's fun too! I mean tomorrow, I-I don't have to wear a tie.
Are you aware that you're still talking?
Ni-hi-ice!
Sorry, we're on a major flan high.
Do you wanna?
You look beautiful. Is this new?
So, Spock actually hugs his father?
I'll be a fool for you. I'm sure, you know I don't mind.
Okay. But if you don't come back soon, there's pretty much nothing I can do about it!
Well, she wasn't sleeping with him.
Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something.
Hey.
Yeah!
OK, so now we draw cards.
All right, look, you're not really gonna buy that are you? Don't you think you've embarrassed me enough for one day?
And Milton Berle has a...
Hey, how 'bout it? You, me, Saturday night?
Big picture please! So I was in the gift shop, and that's when I uh, saw this. New York.) Yeah, y'know what? I thought anything that can fit into this, can't be scary.
Hello!
Our guy smells incredible.
I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?! I'm right. I'm right. Am I right?
Last time I do that, I promise.
Oh my God!
Look, Monica...
Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?
Well, thanks. I grow it myself. Y'know who also has great hair is Joey!
Yeah, I understand.
It's me. I'm the other guy.
What a baby.
Please tell me you got the message!
Uhh, a T-shirt that says, "I don't belong here."
Guess who's back in show business.
Diet soda.
Could I play?
Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!
Okaaay, rock, hard place, me.
No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.
Because, you know, you don't have to. If you want, you could just take a nap right here.
Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers. Y'know, for you, and... I left the door open and she must have gotten out and I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof, which FYI Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. I couldn't find him, and I am so, so, so, sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain.
Okay.
Congratulations.
Oh, well, ah... maybe thats because theyre ah... jealous, of us.
Hey-hey, is Monica here?
Hey, look at this. "My Big Book of Grievances."
All right, let's get some perspective here, ok? These things, they happen for a reason.
Yeah, is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch?
So you uh, want to do something tonight?
So, you still don't think I'm boyfriend material?
Oh God.
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm trppd in an ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr.
Hey!
Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.
I'm not breaking up with her!
And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.
Ross!
Oh, uh, yeah... I just knew that sometimes when you're writing, you... you don't always know the exact time.
There we go little fella.
Really stupid.
What?
Hey Joe!
Because you broke a chair and you broke a chair! The only one around here that hasn't broke a chair, is me!
Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.
Well that would help the pride thing.
And uh, Rachel, glad to have you back.
If you get this one, we buy everybody here a steak dinner!
Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!
I couldn't do it.
Well, yeah actually.
You betcha!
You got it.
Yeah?
What?! Why did you do that?
Oh, just hanging out, talkin' about uh, websites. Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.
You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.
Because I went to an all boys high school and God is making up for it.
I-no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.
Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?
All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?
Hi.
What?
What is it doing here?
No, he's right, I'm totally lying.
Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go.
Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see her tonight. Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight.
Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here?
Well, I'm there too!
Yeah, I do.
All right. Very good.
And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard.
Okay. All right.
I'm back.
Oh, I'm taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer.
Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!
I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.
No-no
Are you sure?! Because our guy smells incredible!
What?
Joey was in a porno movie.
You didn't see how mad he was, y'know?
Fine!
That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy. I've always wanted to know...
Yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it.
Hey!!
I hear ya, Mugsy! But look, all these rooms are fine okay? Can you just pick one so I can watch--have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.
So I really never get to win anymore?
Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.
Let me see the earrings.
Oh yes!
Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.
Hey!
Kathy! Kathy! Hi!! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Fetch! Fetch it! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy.
Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it.
Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?
Okay! I was gonna wait 'til uh, it was official y'know? But I got so excited I just had to tell you guys because you're my best friends.
That was Joey!
Hey Pheebs!
Fancy.
Is he the one with the beautiful wife?
I just came over to drop off...nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?
I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?
All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.
Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here.
Okay, but if you can't...no dinner!
Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.
I can't believe you got us into trouble.
Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.
Ah, sure, Nina. Whats up?
Hey, Pheebs!
She was not good. Not good.
Well, it's sharp, it's metal, I think I can do some, you know, serious damage with it.
Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who's boss.
I did, but...
Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I'm saying?
Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions.
Hey!
Yeah! No! No! No! Don't fall asleep! Okay, I am going to make you some coffee. And I probably won't spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor.
I think it's necessary.
See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the Law & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!
Did you make it, or are you just serving it?
Well, you're not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes...
Me too!!
No, it came out to an even twenty.
....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store.
Look, maybe we should go?
Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room.
No, Janice.
'S'why I'm dancing...
No. We were in the middle of sex...and you fell asleep.
Okay, what do you guys think?
I, I know.
You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.
Oh-ho-ho, I don't think so!
Yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there? Do I need a coat or will all these sweater vests be enough?
Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let me get through it, because it's, it's, it's not gonna be easy.
Why not?! I'd be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to get-oh I see.
Eh...
Yeah, this is so good, that I'm gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.
Okay! So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?
They couldn't be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.
Okay.
Well, that went well.
Can I get a beer.
4:00 A.M.
Okay! Okay! Okay! Oh God, I thought... Wait a minute, I-I can do this. I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. And if you'll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. Monica, will you marry me?
Had the money in the wrong hand.
Oh, good!
Yay!
How about those three pointers?
Its Phoebe! Hi!
Well, it's good that you finally have a place to do that.
C'mon, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy, Huh? Huh? Huh?
Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there.
Yeah!
Yeah!
It's possible. You are very loveable, I'd miss you if I broke up with you. I was just trying to be supportive.
Yes! Way to go, man! Still got the egg, huh?
There are seven?! That's one?
Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get me straight through the week.
Oh my God!
Yeah, didn't he tell ya?
Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!
Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.
Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?
Hey.
Oh, y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother was shot by a hunter.
And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?
Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her? No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!
Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.
Oh I see, I see, because of the third nipple thing. Ha ha ha ha. . .
Well I was... I was exactly expecting company after... 9:15.
Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.
Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer. See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.
Well then, how do you know when vegetables are done?
Oh yeah, it's beautiful country up there.
I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let's just get that thing...pushed back in.
Step away from the duck.
Dude! Dude!
Yeah, o-okay.
No. I'm not letting you or anybody else see, ever.
Oh well, that makes it not terrible.
What are you doing here?
Boy did we make friends with the wrong sister!
Those are my gifts, I got them for you.
So we both finished our vows.
All right, then massage me up right nice!
Okay, I'm a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.
Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
No!
Tell me what?
Yup, get ready for the gelatenous fun.
Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.
Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwearyou want it to be dirty?
Whoa-wh-wh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?
Yo!! Spackel boy! Get up!
Not 700 exactly?
Okay.
If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?
Hey.
Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?
She said yes!! She said yes!! Awful play, man. Whoah. Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way. Oh, listen, the usher gave me this to give to you.
And I will cook anything you want in here , and do anything in there!
Maybe, she doesn't hit him all the time.
It could've been worse, he could've shot her.
Isn't that what happened with you and the bride's maid?
Go change! She doesn't want her parents to know she's drunk.
I'm sorry man.
Oh-no, y'know with Gandolf we'd be out all night!
Oh no-no-no-no!
Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now.
No! Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler! I'm fine. Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I accidentally shut off my phone. Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great. Okay. She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back. She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back...
Ahh, I think it just moved. It's really poking me.
Sure. Ummm. What's up?
Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?
Oh yeah, it's so cool. Now I gotta go, Officer Bing has gotta, 10-100. That's pee-pee.
Forget it! Okay, I'm not giving up the apartment.
But uh Ross, Ross is a great guy! I was roommates with him in college. Uh, funny story... You're roommate in college died didn't he?
What?
Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.
Nice try.
Okay.
Why? What happened to him?
Gap commercial. So did you book them? Did you call?
Y'know, sometimes that fake out thing is just mean!
Ross.
Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman! What's this?
Hey! How'd the audition go?
And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.
I'm sorry. If you ask me, I'd move in with him.
Tell it again. Seriously.
See? Now, that's why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.
Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?
...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?
Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him.
Not if I kiss you first.
Okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him anything.
Hi.
What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie.
That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie.
Really?
So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.
So they're going on dates? When?
Help!
Defend yourself.
Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend. This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?
Well, your kind of sitting in my seat.
Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?
Hey.
Monica.
Centerpieces!
Bye!
Hi, listen, I'm sorry about before. I don't need to have a game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldn't get girls, and now I can 'em-Now, I have you. Not-not that I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, I see women...
That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.
Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?
Oh no-no-no. This is amazing.
I don't know exactly.
Honey, you did call him back. 'Cause, it's, it's really old.
Okay, who wore those?
All right! Ten buck! Fork it over! Cough it up! Pay the piper! Gimme it.
All right, I'll pick that one.
Hello Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day.
I'm just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you're okay.
Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine.
Monica, I think you've gone over to the bad place.
Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. He didn't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up.
What?!
Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!
I talked to Janice.
I'm coming already!!
Hey.
Okay. Bye.
What a minute, I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat! They did experiments on me! I can't have children!!
If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I'll be Crazy Man with a Snake, yknow. Crazy Snake Man. And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. "Run away from Crazy Snake Man," they'll shout!
Y'know it's funny I started it but, now it's scary me. So could you come out here please?
All right.
Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings?
Hike!
What?!
Look Eddie, aren't you forgetting anything?
Oh Maria. You can't say no to her, she's like this lycra spandex covered gym...treat.
See that's where I think that you're wrong. We've been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.
Actually, it's Miss Chinandolor Bong.
It's kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing.
Well, it's official there are no good movies.
Oh my God!
Well, I think it all started when you said, "Hey Joey, why don't you be my best man."
What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!
Hey Joe what's up?
You had to ask.
Maybe it was his sister's. You know, maybe it was his daughter's.
You are so great! I love you!
So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.
I think it's winning.
Hey!
Wow! Look at them run.
Oh, I'll go out and get you some.
I got a good one, I got a good one! I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.
Hey, big...
Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!
Hey, do you want this done quick, or do you want this done right?
You do? Why?
All right, let me in.
Yeah, get out!
Who walks into a room and asks to see a person's hands?!
Really? Worse than, "More turkey Mr. Chandler?"
Okay, give me a second! Did you clean up in here?
What's an identical hand twin?
What?
I'm telling you this thing won't print. Yes, I pressed that button like 100 times. You know, for a hot line you are not so hot. What? What is that in the background? Are you watching Star Trek?
You're a genius!
You mean a three pointer?
Ha-ha-ha--enh-enh. I'm so glad you guys are all here! My office finally got wrinkle free fax paper!
Long!
Not bad.
So, what do you think?
No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?
Yeah... Bunny-rabbit.
OK, what is it about me? Do I not look fun enough? Is there something. . . repellant. . . about me?
Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.
Hey, woah, hey, woah.
What is it?
Well, I suppose I'd have to say you!! But, what if we're watching a movie in here?
God, I love these fingers...
Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!
Hey!
It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent it to us.
Well let's....let's see what everybody thinks of that?
Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
WHAT IS IT?!
Okay, keep saying it!
Well, Kathy's last boyfriend was Joey.
Hey, I've been honing!
Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.
What?
Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
Oh. Oh, God!
Y'know what, I can handle it, handle's my middle name. Actually it's the ah, middle part of my first name.
To Put the Camera Away!!!
Yeah.
Look you have to realize I don't think of you as a thin, beautiful woman. See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is you're Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica.
Do you remember talking to me yesterday?
Hey!
Well, thanks a lot for hookin' me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
You're right, and I'm sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I won't say another word tonight.
Oh, she's sorry! I feel better!
Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and I'm afraid even more sweating.
Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection.
You gotta let me slam the door!
Actually Monica and I are engaged.
Yeah?
Yeah, all right.
Well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend and her brother, I can't do that we promised we'd make each other gifts this year.
You okay?
Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence...
Hey!
This is terrible. What am I going to do?
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Hello, Chandler Bing.
Ahh, Gepeto, $5,000 dollars? Are you insane?
Honey, it is not a date! I haven't talked to her in ten years! You can't just call up somebody you haven't talked to in ten years and ask them for a favor. There are rules, y'know? You gotta, you got to put in some time.
Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.
Did he just say, he loves Fonzie?
Well, why don't you tell her to stop being silly!
'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'
Phoebe, it's me. You can tell me anything.
So- you can tell?
What is with him?
Well y'know, what if she didn't actually sleep with the guy?
Okay, I gotta go to work.
Hey, guys, it's after midnight, merry Christmas everyone.
Oh my God.
Oh, well thank you in advance.
I will have one.
It's a sock bunny.
You mean scared.
Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?
I can't believe she's married.
Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?
Freedom! I want my freedom! Why won't you here me?! Sophie, help me! Help me!!
We can't accept this.
Because of the weekend, we had a fight.
That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!
Hey.
Well he's probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.
Hey.
I can't believe this.
What?!
Yeah, that's kinda a relief.
Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
Sure.
Is it on?
Hey Joe!
Okay, anything for you sir?
I'll take that.
Oh, yeah, sure, it's not mine anyway. It can with the pants.
Yeah, see, I can't pull of baby-doll can I?
Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?
Look, this isn't funny! You get back here right now!
Right!
Pheebs, we're not giving you a deposit for our wedding!
I don't like your massages.
Where is she? I'm not scared of you!
Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?
No you can't.
Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...
Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.
What does it look like? I'm going home.
Oh my God! Oh my God!
Hey Eddie. Daahh!! What're you doin' here?
Which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year.
Okay!
Oh! It's on! It's on!
What?
Really?! That's what you heard? You said that?
Is anybody else scared?
Okay, on three. One....Two....
The reason he just said.
Joey's a sex addict.
Well, you're welcome. And tell them we're really glad they're coming.
What?!
Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!
What?
Hey.
I think it's great. It's great. Y'know, they're thinking of changing the name of this place.
OK, I was wrong, that's what they used to cover Connecticut.
So is your apron. You're wearing it like a cape.
Varrrrrroom! Hey! Watch it lady! Varrrrrrrrrrom! Hey-hey good lookin'! Varrrrrrrrroom. All right, I'll leave. My bed's so boring.
Hey, don't worry. I figure it'll be 2 hours to Phoebe's dad's house, they'll meet, they'll chat, they'll swap life stories, we'll still have plenty of time.
If they can't find a home for her, they kill her! And I'm not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!
You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!
Yeah, you-you gotta love the talking.
Oh yeah, me too, she's so cool and pretty.
No-no! This is my fiancee and her heart was set on that ring. You don't want to break her heart now do you?
Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames.
I know what you're thinking, Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's.
Me?! Why me?
Batman has the Batmobile!
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh!
Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?
Richard! No one supposed to know about us! See I, did it again.
Don't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that?
I'm doing this because I'm sorry?
Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
He will, Joe.
Uh, yeah.
That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...
Yes!! I love you! I can't even remember what we were fighting about!
Mar-haaaan.
Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?
Why can't you tell her?
Did they teach you that in your anger management class?
All right, I took the quiz, and it turns out, I do put career before men. Get up.
All right.
So, uh... what do you think it is about me?
Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!
Hey, how was your breakfast with Hillary?
Hey, it's Janice.
Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!
Well, uh, Dr. Greene, where are you going?
.
Hey.
Hey Pheebs!
Great job with the cups, Pheebs!
Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me!
Yeah you are!!
Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!
Did you not understand the story?
Or we can do the actual telephone thing.
Why did you take the shower curtain down?
Hi, oh hi.
You couldn't have at least changed your shirt.
Question. If I don't care about my watch, can I use it as a weapon?
Alrighty.
Go.
About Ross!
Man, she is really gullible.
Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves winking.
Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!
So this is nice! I wish I didn't have to go, believe me! But unfortunately I have to. Oh uh, by the way, what's the name the girl you're dating?
Well, I've got a girl in here.
You couldn't have told me about this on the phone?
Well, uh, let's try one more. . . there you go, say Ernie's, 8 o'clock.
Yeah, never cheat on Rachel.
Hey!
Our new fridge? I don't live here anymore.
What a geek!
You got the lead in a movie? That's amazing! What's the movie about?!
Well, this is much better.
Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick!
It still doesn't work.
Yeah, we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid we used to look.
We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the road once.
No one was around to hear that?
Congratulations!
: I thought we had them!
Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this.
Sorry.
Y'know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?
You are a frightening, frightening man.
Dude, don't do that too me!
It was terrible. I fought with my colleagues y'know, the entire time. Are you kidding with this?
OK, then, eat me, I'm done.
Next time?
I can't believe I ruined this.
Well Monica just told me that they don't.
I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.
Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? I'm right, right?
I've met the perfect woman. OK, we're sitting on her couch, we're fooling around, and then suddenly she turns to me and says, 'Do you ever want to do it in an elevator?'
All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing's right. And that's what deathbeds are for.
Hey, listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if I would've known you guys were... I never would've...
She was working on Valentine's Day so we're celebrating it tonight.
Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special. Y'know, technically we still are over international waters.
Oh, yeah?
Okay.
Uh-oh, it's my boss!
Y'know, whipped! Wah-pah!
Okay, I'm not gonna have one.
Okay.
Yeah, it is the best.
Yes... thank you. That was... that was....
Oh, what's the matter?
What are the odds? What are the odds?
Phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago.
Oh, no-
No, no, no. No-no-no.
No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.
When we were?
Okay, worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father.
You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!
Thank you, sir.
There it is.
Why haven't you told them?! Wouldn't they be happy?!
Yeah.
Oh my God, I can't believe this! Y'know, I thought...I thought you were a good guy.
So, what do you think?
Here you go. Now stop bringing us pizzas you.
If we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out soon?
I don't know, Richard's really nice and everything, uh, it's just that we don't know him really well, ya know, and plus he's, ya know, old -er than some people, but, uh, younger than some buildings.
What's wrong?
Hey, yo.
What the hell is going on?!
Yes, it is, at Office Max.
Where is Emily?
Who are those people?
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.
Who's Rick?
Why?! What happened?!
You're right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
Okay!
Thanks, it's ah, Gaelic, for 'Thy turkey's done.' So ah, I'm gonna go, nice, nice meeting you.
Hey!
Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay.
Well, it does not ring a bell with me...
So umm, you-you flirt with guys all the time?
Hey! Hi! You uh, ready to exchange gifts?
Okay, will you just go help her change please!
Yes, but there's two in martini, soo everybody back to my office.
That was pretty 007.
That's great!
More importantly, was I any good?
I'm not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.
Relax your hand!
Why don't you open with a joke?
I can't believe you came back.
Okay, I'll stop.
Well this one's for you.
Oh, I don't know.
Uh, if you say so sir.
Ohhh. Don't go.
He's taking off her coat!
But, we'll stay here with you.
No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?
Oh I'm so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?
Oh, you get used to it.
Still broken?
Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere.
Yeah, well I don't think you can make that statement, unless you've been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.
Yes, and we call Ross Lingers In The Bathroom.
I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
Hey, buddy boy, how'd the audition go?
Whoa!
Yes, but if it's any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it.
And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty seven dollars. No strings attached. Now, if you can't remember that, I think we should write it down-let's write it down!
Okay.
He's got nothing!
His legs flail about as if independent of his body!
We're worried about you.
Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It's the oldest game!
Give him money? It was a joke!
Four different women! I've had sex way more times!
By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall.
Huh! Where is the dog?!
Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?
Yes, I am!
That is lucky.
You got it. Good woman! Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
....three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with the American Ballet Theater?!
Oh, no I don't.
I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was Deep Impact and which one was Armageddon?
Come on, pick up, pick up! Hello? Transit Authority? Yes, hello. I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus. Yes I do realize that would be a very stupid charact er.
What?!
'Kay.
Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this.
So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!
No, no he went for a walk.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that? I kinda have a dream! I don't want to talk about it.
Off?!!
What?
I know I am.
Oh no-no-no, you-yeah, of course you get to be my best man.
I may have.
Oh, that's Parent's Day, first grade. That's me with the janitor Martin.
Okay, I promise, I'll end it.
Well see now that I can see crying over, but Bambi is a cartoon!
Hey, I'm going for sushi does anybody want.. Whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp.
Monica!
OK, so at this point, the dealer...
Why?
You'll get one.
Your pants!
Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.
"Happy Birthday Peehe."
Yeah.
Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?
We came over as soon as we saw.
Love what you've done with the place.
You know, I once dated a Miss Crankypants. Lovely girl, kinda moody.
Well, I don't see that we have a choice. But, when we're back home, we don't do it.
I don't even know the man. Okay? We're not the close. I haven't seen him in years.
Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.
Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.
I'm just hanging out. Y'know, having fun. Y'know with the girl that I'm seeing casually.
I can't believe she can out run you man!
That's not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don't say that I don't have goals!
I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OH...MY...GOD.
Alright, we're gettin' closer.
Okay, come here! Come here.
Well it you don't know that, then I don't want to do this with you.
So, you don't think I'm terminal?
Well, I... I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know.
Now, there is a dress laid out on your bed. Okay, you're doing great. You're doing great. You're doing fine.
Couldn't be more out.
Listen can you guys uh, speak up, it's harder for us to hear you when you lower your voice.
What?!
Look forget it okay? I don't want to go. I don't want to see him. I don't wanna.
We can talk about that.
Hey.
And you're okay with that?
Okay, but this is the last time. With a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there. Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick--chickeeeen.
Ahh, ooh, try a hard 8.
I know it would make me happy, ma'am.
Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you.
And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others.
Really?
Yeah we do!
Well.... it is amouz-ing...
Well the vet seems to think that's she's becoming a rooster. We're getting a second opinion.
What, what are you laughing at?
Ooh, I do! I do! I do!
If you listen very carefully, I think its Celebration by Cool and the Gang.
Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice.
Theyre twins!
Yeah. O-okay.
Nothing, I just like to go like this.
Hello.
Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer.
So when you said, "Get up early," did you mean 1986?
Joey...
Yeah.
Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.
I KNEW IT!!!!
Yes.
No way!
Well, hello!
So what are you going to do?
What are you doing?
What about things that are already gold?
Was the setting of Phoebe's triumph.
Yeah, it's two guys in a ring, and the rules are "There are no rules."
'Cause it's gross.
Pirates again?
All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!! Pipe-pipe-pipe down! What is the matter with you people?! This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you, and I'll bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right?
Well, how do you find clothes that fit?
So, is Janine around?
You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection. 'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no, no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself.
Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, it's the only chance to see New York.
Ok, you can not do this to me.
What?
There's the man.
I'll take it! All right look, I gotta know. Are you finished with me? Are you finished with him? Do you still love him? Do you still love me? All right look, I'm gonna need an actual answer here okay, so which is it, him or me?
So you might say, it's a magic ring.
That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up.
You have done enough!
What?
That's a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.
Sure, why not?
I-kea! This is comfortable.
How do you figure that?
I want you to say that you like her!
Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks.
Ohh.
The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.
Oooh that may be a New World's record
I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!
Ok, they're coming, shhh.
Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me?
Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? : "When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy!"
Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different. I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, ... boom.
Mom. Thanks for wearing something.
Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!
Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her.
That's great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.
He's the headliner of a gay burlesque show.
I'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay, it was like she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I just-I didn't know what it was!
Fine, let's do it.
Oh, yeah, he's my... he's my best friend.
The cushions are the essence of the chair!
It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...
Hey man, what's up?
Have I got the 50 guys for you!
No, no no no. You'll be fine. Hillary's bind, right?
Yeah, she's dying... Of a cough apparently.
All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!
I was asleep. Oh no! No-no honey! Y'know what's sexy? Layers. Layers are sexy. And blankets are sexy. And oh! Hot water bottles are sexy.
Phil.
We have to leave for New York in an hour.
Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!
Perfect decibel.
I'm not fine. Here she comes.
Okay. It's a chicken.
I'll make something up! I'm good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman!
You're obviously not their favorite pet.
What are you guys talking about?
Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no waiting.
Oh my God, introduce us!
Yes, please don't spoil all this fun.
Because you shouldn't be with him. You should be with me.
Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked , or, or a big tub of jam.
You said...
Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk....
Out of my league. I could get a Brian. If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. Hey, Brian.
Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that I'm related to Monica. How is she?
Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really happened' thing?
About what?
Y'know when I said that because we're getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets?
No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.
Uh, two larges, extra cheese on both. But listen, don't ring the buzzer for 19, ring 20, Geller-Green, they'll let you in, OK. If you buzz our door, there's no tip for you. OK, thanks. Pizza's on the way. I told you we wouldn't have to get up.
No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I can't get myself right out of them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and I'm cold, and
Y'know when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look, you don't, you don't do that every year do you?
Uuuh.
Mr. and Mrs. Bing!
"Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." Nice!
OK. Brake left, gas right?
Yes.
Beam me up Jesus.
Dude, you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up.
So, uh, wh-where ya from?
Hey!
Ok, but can you tell him that, because he thinks he's too pink.
Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone?
Hey, listen, why don't we go change in my room?
Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!
I was making a coconut phone with the professor.
Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut.
Wow, you look...
Oh you wouldn't uh, care. It's just a stupid comic book story.
Wellll?
Well, I-I still think you're very-very nice and very pretty...
Okay.
Yeah, I'm sorry man.
Okay. You were right. I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.
Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.
Look, maybe I got carried away before. But there's something you gotta know. If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best.
My diary! My diary, that's brilliant. I should have told her it was my diary, she never would have made me read her my diary.
Yeah, me either.
Oh, I'm Ross. I'm Ross. I'm too good for the Hut; I'm too good for the Hut.
I know you probably don't want to go out with me, y'know because I make too many jokes and I've never been in a serious relationship and I guess I'm not technically a "doctor..."
Fine, I'll give the suit back.
If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard.
Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they're very hot.
Hey.
Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?
Alright. "It was summer, and it was hot. Rachel was there. A lonely gray couch. 'Oh, look,' cried Ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. The end."
Totally crazy stupid.
They're in my bag over there.
What is up?
Okay, so we've established my name, and hit me. But theoretically y'know, I mean say we weren't friends, say it's a blind date. I show up at your door, and I'm like "Hey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey."
Okay, good.
What?
All right.
It's Paris, who knows we're here!
Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?
Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car.
Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?
Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs.
The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
You are gonna be a huge star! I'm gonna hug ya!
Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight.
Oh since forever! I used to go all over town listening to bands!
Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
I'm gonna say this for the last time. Would you please just...
Oh yeah! With who?
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... Did I say that out loud?
We got some Vap-O-Rub in some places.
Well, it is overdue.
Ah, there we go.
Nope, not under here!
Well the package says you have to uh, constantly keep it moving. Stir and drink, stir and drink, never let it settle.
Ok, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky.
Oh God!
Listen Eddie, um, I've been thinking about our current living situation and uh, why are you smiling?
Guys? I've got something important to tell ya. Guys? Guys?! I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.
Excuse me. How ya doin'?
Yes! Ross, you have to stay!
Yeah, okay.
Joey, no means no!
Oh, that's Ross's.
Bedroom. Bathroom. Living room. This right here is the kitchen, and thanks for coming by, Bye-bye.
Y'know what, I'm gonna uh, play the field just a little more.
Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.
G'night.
No, I wasn't gonna ask you that, no.
My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!
What is going on here?
Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.
Yeah, I know that means buddy!
I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship. Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives.
Yeah.
That's weird. I don't think my boss likes me either.
Hey.
Woooo!!!
Jeez, at 2:30 in the morning, I didn't expect to have to fight over the remote.
Alright, I'll tell you what, you call the couch and then, and then we'll call the couch, and we'll see who it comes to.
Ya know, the man's got a point.
So, uhh, em, you want me to uh, give you a hand with the foosball table?
Dog grooming huh? Okay, just don't make my tail too poofy.
What are you writing?
But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.
No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.
How long you been waitin' to say that?
What is it?
Oh yeah, your uh, name came up in a uh, conversation that terrified me to my very soul.
Hey!
Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh, barks into the night. Well, who doesn't love dogs? Ah, he's a tap dancer! Yes, some would say that is a lost art. He's a pimp! There you go! Yes, he's a pimp. He's a big, tap dancing pimp! Hello?
What are you doing out there?
Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.
I don't know. But I-I-I know I love you!
Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? I'm going to go over to Joey's.
Rach...
You're not even giving them a chance!
It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman, and instead you had to settle for Robin.
Actually, me too.
I'm going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?
No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
Hey, is Rachel here?
Bye..... ridiculously dull Bobby.
You totally screwed him over.
Isn't Ben in this?
Y'know what? It seems like all of the sudden; so much has happened.
Yeah, I'll take care of it.
Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkin' out the Chan-Chan man!
He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady.
Yes, yes I am. Err, listen, the reason that I called you in here today was, err... please dont hate me.
I'm marrying her.
We have to assign heads to something.
Oh, I'm packing. Y'know I'm-I'm packing 'cause I'm moving to Yemen tomorrow.
My friend's name is Joey.
Hey!
No, the doctors say it may kill her.
I was not and oh God, shh!
What?
So do you think uh, Joey's more charming than me?
Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here!
Kinda. They're really big.
Hey!
Now imagine you live at the supermarket.
I'm telling ya, Joanna's got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, 'This was fun. Let's do it again sometime. I'll give you a call.'
All right, Ross, I just have to do one thing, really quickly, it's not a big deal. GET UP!!
Well, I'm going to kill you.
This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program!
Good luck!
Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.
Who jumps at loud noises!
You think?
Hey, I didn't make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500. Don't get to excited because that's not gonna happen unless you get-No way!
Yeah, I'm cool. Casual.
In a foreign, romantic country...
Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you.
If marriage worked, I'd be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.
I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work! He does not know that I am not some of us.
He's at a dinner party.
No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!
Uh why, do you have a lecture?
Here goes.
I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.
Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because it's romantic, but because I can!
Dee, the sarcastic sister from Whats Happening.
Yeah, yeah, she works over at that place, uh...
Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division.
Hey, Pheebs!
Y'know, I, I really don't think we need a canoe.
Janice is gonna go away now.
What did you guys just do?!
Look out kids, he's coming!
Uh, Dana Keystone from college.
Guys are signing over their 401-K's to me?
Wha-
You.
Well, close to...
Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? He's not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys that's like a third or fourth date kinda thing.
... And where's this money coming from?
Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a copier. Look, if there was anything I could do, I would do it. Okay? But everybody's allowed one mistake, right?
Really? Struck down in the pribe of libe!
Gary, I'm here to report a crime.
Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with one too.
OK.
Wow! She looks great. Doesn't she?
What stupid thing did you do?
Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.
Damn Rollos!
And?
Your cappucino sir.
Sydney Portier? Hehheh.
Oh-ho-ho-ho-no! No! No switching! No sharing, and don't come crying to me! Ha-ha-ha! I may just sit here and have my cake all day! Just sit here in the hallway and eat my...
Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.
I messed up. Okay? I'm sorry, I really messed up.
'Cause he was just so darn cute.
Okay.
Okay! Okay! Okay!
That's not really important right now. What is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just don't feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.
Hey!
Okay, you guys uh, you guys pick first
Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?
Hi! Nice to meet you!
Excellent hole, Joe.
Oh, uhh, actually I uh, have some news.
Wait! You look? You-you massaged me.
Ok, well, this was very special.
Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?
I am now!
Hey Phoebe!
You can tell us.
Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?
Really?! You do that?
No Joey! No Joey! Don't Joey! Joey!
Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?
What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?
All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'
Our guy has great hair.
Oh. Oh right! Right! Because you're still seeing him and uh, he's a good guy. I mean, I remember a time when...
Do you know me or are you just really good at this game?
Oh, I have to get married in James Bond's tux!
Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?
You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli.
No, actually Laurie's a boy.
That was amazing.
Richard was there so I couldn't do it!
Open up! Open up! Open up!
Ohh, so?
Uh-oh.
This is not going to work.
One more game?
Okay, one...two...
Nope, nope, I'd just ah, I'd rather talk to you. Yes, I do. Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom.
Hello, Janice.
Well, y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as... Ahh, what?
The British are coming?
Maybe, isn't she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?
I like it in the stern. ...of the boat. Hello.
Okay I promise. I'll-I'll hate it. Wow! You-you look...hideous.
Yeah o-okay, but I'm just doing this for you.
What are you doing?
Joey, it's been three days, okay.. Your just a little homesick, Okay. Would you just try to relax. Just, just try to enjoy yourself.
It's an old key!
Because we hate them.
At least as long as I have the pants.
Without me?!
Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.
I know.
There you go! There you are!
: What do you need, what do you need?
Ooh.
Yeah, like in a cab...
Not like that, I won't! Kip would have liked the birds!
That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienist's blouse.
Hello!
Here, here!
Oh just great. He beeps me now with codes. One is, "Bring me food." Two is, "I'm with a girl, bring us food." Three is, "I'm lost and I can't find food."
Hey! I'm sorry! That- where are you going?
Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.
You guys wanna eat here?
Well then maybe you should take it.
Shhhhhhhhh!!! I'm sorry, I thought maybe I'd make some warm milk and it would help me sleep.
Love your condoms my man.
Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?
I love you. And I know about the baby.
I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . Hi!
He's open!
Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack.
Well yeah, but then...
He had sex with Mr. Girabaldi!
Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area?
Okay, umm, we all have to play strip poker.
Why not?!
I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
Uh-huh.
I spelled out boobies.
You hear that! That is her chose, mister I'll let you have her! I win! You suck! I rule all! A mini-wave in celebration of me!!
What?! I'm Chandler! Oh, that's Richard!
Now, is that never talking about it again?!
Look, I just don't think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Y'know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. Y'know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?
Yes please.
Yeah! When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me! Look, things like last night they don't just happen. Y'know? Or at least not to me. Or with the other two women, in the morning y'know I was just lying there and I couldn't wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always y'know with a friend.
Is that a problem?
Having a swim.
Oh hey, how'd the interview go?
Okay, okay, you got it!
Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh, great book and you are the queen of everything.
That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman.
Okay.
Y'know those big-big uh, road signs that say "Merge?"
Nice job Joe! You're quite the craftsmen.
I don't think that's what they were talking about Joe!!
So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!
You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?
Oh, good job Joe.
Clunkers?! Oh my god!
Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did.
Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause I like to be surprised.
All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I can't believe I missed it.
That's right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.
Well, you don't you have Captain Hook explain it to her.
Here I am.
There's no back to this couch!
Huh-huh! You can't give her that.
Yeah, I know.
Oh my God, how did you do that?
All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him!
Stop what?!
You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...
This is not going to work.
You-you-you didn't know that. Well, I guess my work here is done!
What are you guys? Like a gang or something?!
Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special. Y'know, technically we still are over international waters.
Hey.
Well we could just stay in and cook for ourselves.
That was you!
Ow!
You got me.
No, I don't even think he knew. Hey, would you sleep with somebody to get a great job?
Okay! Okay! Let me try it again, you're gonna wanna date this next guy, I swear!
All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y'know, you're gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.
You know, I think I might just.
It happened in London.
I know, this is a great apartment.
I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!
Uh, Joey is gonna be right back. Right back! Meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you. So, you're old and small.
No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.
You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!
Yeah, I don't you should say that even when you're healthy.
Stop talkin' to your men.
Oh it's uh, over there on the table.
I'm here to see Mary-Angela.
I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?
We share a wall! So either he's great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.
Well, uh, we can talk about that too Pheebs.
Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?
Y'know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs...
Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.
What does it say?!
Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I've missed the last 1200 times.
So...
Air hole! Air hole!!
Way to be cool, man.
What just happened?
Hey.
Tonight, on a very special Blossom.
Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with? Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. Y'know, I feel like I've lost her.. Ba-!
Right. So uh, have you written yours yet?
Yeah. You're right. Hey I-I can do that.
Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the place where I-I made it and pick-pick it up.
This is ridiculous.
Shall I carve?
I can't believe we live here!
Oh, don't thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work.
Oh yeah, but don't worry. I don't think anybody's gonna focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress.
So ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?!
Because it's too delicious.
Really?!
Youre not gonna lose him.
I'm sorry. I'm-I'm-I'm sorry that I said I was going to when I'm not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And this isn't Rachel's fault. It's me. I have serious, serious problems when it comes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy, mascara goop. And I'm really sorry, it's just that this is not, this isn't going to work out.
Ya know Phoebs, don't feel so bad for 'em. After they're done playing, I break out the little plastic women and everybody has a pretty good time.
OK, stop.
Yes. Yes!
Hi, my name's Chandler. I just moved in next door and I was wondering if you would be interested in battling me in a post-apoplectic world for control of the galaxies last remaining energy source?
Ohhh!
Hi, Pheebs!
Janice's birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me.
Eeeshk.
And now you're giving me the message!
Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?
Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.
Okay, so when do you want to go?
We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so y'know...
If I broke up with you, I'd miss you.
Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.
Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.
Y'know what? I can't believe this! Do you know what you did? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!
What?
Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.
Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I just stopped talking!
I did! I absolutely did!
I had sex today. I never have to answer that phone again.
I'll give up my ticket.
Yes, but for the last time.
Hey Ross.... bahhhh!
But the Kit-Kats are all right?!
Okay. It's not different at all, is it?
Your sister Ursula.
Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I'll be sure to give him your shoe.
Staying out of the way.
Don't worry, I'm brave! I am brave! I...I am brave! No-no-no-no!! Can you tell me who is there please?
Coffee house?
A hot girl's at stake and all of the sudden he's Rain Man.
Oh man!!
I don't want to say.
Joey?
In a bad way?
I'm not yanking you.
Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!
Oh that is over!
What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.
Bob here.
No thanks, Mom!
Yes...Yes..Uh-huh, You? We did you.
You got it. You got Nevada twice.
No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. Will you be my wife?
Doug!!
Always illegal Joe.
I don't know if I've told you this, but he's kinda tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years
Monica?
No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you'd have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Y'know it's hard enough to be fourteen. You're skinny. You're wearing speedoes-That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and there's your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!
Happy Anniversary, 10 months!
Oh, okay. Here you go.
Because it says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate Monica" on the bottom.
Okay, I'm going to go stand over there.
Yes!!
Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole in that door.
Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere.
OK, but uh, I hope you realize this means we're gonna miss hearing about the specials.
What?
No you know I don't mind.
See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. Me.
...And what did you bring?
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! Yes, the groom-No! Not the groom!!
And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?
I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking.
Hey, mister tux!
Because, if Santa and the Holiday...Armadillo? ...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!
Like what?
Well, never say never but y'know probably uh yeah, never.
Why is Phoebe singing to Carl Mulden?
Hey, what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be at work?
Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!
Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!
Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack!
Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in...vegetables, Joey?
Or a job where you don't have to carry a table.
....with??
I don't believe it. The most romantic night of my life and I'm runner up.
Well, either that or uh...
Nngghhh!!!!!!!
What? What? Why?!
Thanks.
Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians.
And you... Ross, I believe, if you check Rachel's bag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there.
What are you talking about?
Should we call the spitter?
Oh, is that against the rules?
Joey, I saw you push him!
Let it go!!
Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?
Y'know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs...
Have you ever been with a woman?
Our minister...
Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?
Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I just stopped talking!
Skidmark's still got a way with the ladies.
Whoa-whoa-whoa! We're having kids?!
Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
Because, I-I should've called! Y'know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would've gone out with Nick, and they would've ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!
Yeah! You wanna come?
Math!! You're giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forget about it, you go for the girl, we'll see who gets her.
Yeah.
Okay great.
Mma, Mma, Mmaah
Ok, there is one more way to say it, who knows it?
Okay .
Okay, a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I can't get in!
Thanks.
Well, I'm, I'm sorry... Ahhh. Have we met?
Yes.
Yeah?
Well, I could make it seem like he's here. "Here's some little known facts about cous-cous. They didn't add the second cous until 1979."
I don't care, she slept with me.
Okay, there are no famous Joey's. Except for, huh, Joey Buttafucco.
Hey man, look it's my best bud. How ya doin? Wow, you are really gettin' good at that Marcel Marceau thing. Hey, whaddya say uh, we play some ball, you and me, huh, whaddya say? OK, that's my bad.
Yeah, you wish.
Ah, I fooled around with Joey's sister. Well, that's not the worst part.
Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.
Okay.
Oh, that's uh, that's pretty nice but I'm gonna go with the one I picked first.
Okay!
You mean you didn't get it from this?
Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment!
What about the time difference?
And I'm sure we're all very excited that Ross and Emily are getting married at Montgomery Hall. I mean to think, my friend getting married in Monty Hall. Ohh, come on!! Monty Hall!! Lets make a Deal!! Come on, you people!! All right, forget it!! Congratulations, Ross and Emily.
You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom...
Then what?
I'm gonna call and get off work tomorrow!
Okay.
OK.
They don't really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can get you some free white out though.
Hey!
Oh, so you're already doing your part for the kids.
This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor?
Good night.
Y'know, I would've bet good money that he'd be the first one of us to get married.
Hey! Oh, good, Ross! You're parents like me, right?
Yeah?
Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse.
No!
What are you guys doing out here?
I don't wanna know what Monica got me. Y'know? I mean, look, I'm sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not what Christmas is about.
Together.
All right.
Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!
They do?
Ok, so let me just get this straight. So we're uh, strictly talking about the middle?
Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights.
What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?
Okay. What was tonight?
It's the theme from Good Will Humping.
No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.
Hey, listen, why don't we go change in my room?
I'm sorry you misunderstood...
Ahhhh-I'm not going to call you.
Hey! Do we have a baby name yet?
Stop talking, stop talking now. Let me just get this straight. You're actually stealing my hat?
I don't know.
Stupid, useless Canadian money!
Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats!
You don't think I get up when you get up?
Oh, ahh, no thanks, I just had an M&M.
You don't like that show?
Wouldn't it be easier if we just moved?
Lovely!
Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby.
Now you do that, you're on TV.
Hey, sweetums.
I don't know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. She's saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to Dollywood.
I think I do! Thank you, Monica.
Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it just seems that Robert isn't as concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped.
I used to have that bumper sticker.
See, that's why I could never be an actor. Because I can't say gig.
You don't have it.
Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if you're not careful you may not get married at all this year!
Of!
Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! The Blowfish!
Shut-out!!
Thanks for picking out the earrings man.
Oh my God!
What are you, stop naming dwarves! Hello, Janice. Hi, I'm so glad that you called, I know I've been acting a really weird lately. And, it's just because I'm crazy about you, and I just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid a couple of more times. I'm sorry. Really?! Really?!
Put Joey on the phone.
Hey! What are you guys doing?
Oh, no-no-no-no-no....
Ooh, oh, oh, that's her.
Can you figure out what I'm doing?
Well this is great! I'll give you a call! We should do it again sometime!
Okay, uh, how about, how about-y'know what? We could play a new game. A new game, it's fun.
Leave me alone! For the love of God, leave me alone!!!
I always thought having a heart attack was nature's way of telling you to die! But you're not gonna die. I mean, you are going to die, but you're not gonna die today. I wish I was dead.
No, I'm not!
Du-ude!
Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.
Do you think you could get through a poem?
And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.
So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!
Uh, uh.
No, you're the best.
Okay to come in?
Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
Pheebs! We have to take you to the hospital now!
We can't do this.
I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already?
Fine with me.
Hi, Joe.
We think he was trying to spell out 'MONKEY.'
I feel violated. And not in a good way.
Oh, God.
Hey.
And your friend Phoebe?
So, uh, how often can you do it?
What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue!
All right.
But I just wa...
How little?!
All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference...
Okay.
Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?
Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy , uh but he doesn't want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assist-as his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that can't have lumps in them.
Yes talk to her. Be a man.
As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I'm going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.
Well you don't have to sound so surprised.
I can see why that's hard to resist.
Oh yes, sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro? Please let them win!
Eldad is much more cooperative! And he can dance! You dance for Rachel!
Is there any chance you didn't see that?
Had it.
And twenty-five it is.
Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite! It's no big deal.
But I do know that it's some time tomorrow.
So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.
Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right!
Yes, yes I actually saw him leave. I mean that guy is standing in the window holding a human head. He is STANDING IN THE WINDOW HOLDING A HUMAN HEAD!
What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. Y'know some might find it amusing, I myself find it regular.
Look, it's my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you.
Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't serve donuts. Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? I think I can come up with something better than that.
Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it's feed!
It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything.
All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out.
Oh my God!
I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.
You don't turn and slide, you throw it out! I'm tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!
Eh, somebody's in a good mood!
Yes, we were just...
Y'know what, it doesn't matter, 'cause she picked me. Me! From now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready, Set, Cook!
All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racist jokes now?!
Hey.
She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it.
God?
Thank God!
Goin' out, huh? Wow! Wow! So things didn't work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.
Can I uh see something?
YEAH!!! YES!!!
Oh Joey's got a really bad hernia, but that's nothing a little laser eye surgery won't fix!
Hi. Okay, you're too late okay? Because she's already with our guy.
Yes, include more people in this.
Are you eating the cheesecake without me?!
I know, I know, but you're gonna have plenty of chances. There are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over.
Look, when I've been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly, and I'm sorry.
No, no, no.
Are you serious?
Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that's great! Y'know so you can cook while in the tub.
Oooh, I'm afraid that does not exist.
That would be impossible to resist if you weren't all drippy here.
Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!!
Two hours, that lasted!
With Roger? Not just with Roger?! Oh my God!
Ohh yes.
You can't just call Monica's room.
Okay, well, it's definite, two more weeks of winter.
That's right! Where are the guys? I'm ready to get drunk and see some strippers.
Okay.
Okay! Now you stay out here, and you think about what you did!!
Oh-ho-ho-ho.
Okay, it's not a guy, all right, I know her.
What?
Yeah. Oh it's not warm yet, we still have time.
Hey, what did your agent say?
Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.
That's what I did. Wah-pah!
It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.
Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!
Hey.
Oh, that's mature.
Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board! I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya! I went to Ross's! I went to the coffeehouse! I went to any place that they made sandwiches!
Yes, here it comes! I'm stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? Well I don't think so mister!
Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't it?
That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.
There's a Mr. Bing!
There's another carton right over there.
If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?
Uh-huh.
I know.
I will have the uh, Cajun catfish.
Okay!
That's the thing, see I would like to stay in the pribe of mwha-ah-libe.
Really?
Water! Water! Water!
That's a good idea. I wonder where I could get a basket of porn...
Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebe's song about?
Yes, we're standing out ground...apparently.
All right, check out this bad boy. 12 megabytes of ram. 500 megabyte hard drive. Built-in spreadsheet capabilities and a modem that transmits at over 28,000 b.p.s.
Uh, what was that?
Hey, look at this! They're lighting the big Christmas tree tonight.
No, I can't. No no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, it's about you and me and the fact that we're best buds.
I was being Shelly Winters from The Poseidon Adventure.
Okay, now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be a surprise and she's gonna know.
"Smoke away."
Noo.
And condoms are the way to do that?
Hi Monica.
Our next cocktail party?
Yeah, alright.
Oh, tell her good luck with that.
That's one?
You got a Cheeto on your face man.
Fears and Pet Peeves.
All right look, if you're not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!
Look at her go! She must love me more than I love her! What's wrong with me? Ooh, don't open that door.
Yeah, and someday when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges.
Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. Oh.. my.. God.
Ha! Ha! Ha!
I'm sorry, I guess I just like the pulp.
No, the little girl creeps me out.
Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go..
You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?
Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face. But, uh, it's gone now, you're alright.
Joey! Joe! Full bag. Beer's still cold. Something terrible must've happened here! Oh no-no-no-no-no-no! Stevie, I was never here!
What a sweet story.
Rachel lost Marcel.
Look, I'm sorry! But there's nothing I can do, I think I'm in love with her!
Happy birthday! I'm sorry.
Hey.
Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?
Okay, so you both just know this stuff?
When I was growing up I...played the one on the far left.
Oh! That's great, they haven't seen the place since I moved in!
Okay. My word! Those are snug.
You know the hotels?
I'm never gonna find a roommate, ever.
Pete Becker. Pete... Is this him?
We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes.
No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?
Ba dum bumb cheshhh!
Y'know I was thinking if we had a...a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours...
Could you get us a couple of beers?
Don't do it.
Hey! Which one's my turkey burger?
Y'know what? We're not sad, we're not sad, we're just not 21 anymore. Y'know? I'm 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!
Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go.
Really? He does? Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks!
See ya. Have fun planning your mellow bachelor party.
I don't know what it is, I just can't take a good picture.
See ya. Goodbuy you fruit drying psychopath. So you want me to help you unpack your stuff?
Really? Male nurses?
Whoa! Don't know about that.
Hey!
Plus, you look cool.
Buh-bye. I just got us reservations at Michelle's and tickets to the Musicman to celebrate our first holiday season as a betroughed couple.
Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that.
That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight. Maybe there's something in that area.
Noo.
No, I'm not mocking you, or you beautiful guest room.
Yes! Yes! I'm good! Are you good? Are you good? Is everything-are you-are you perrr-perfect?!
What, what, what?!
Ross, I am not gonna run away again! I just want to get a little fresh air.
Gee, Monica, what's in the bag?
You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?
No, I'm alright, thanks.
I'm getting dressed.
Hey!
Hey, I hear what your saying, okay? And, thanks for the warning.
What?
Well that's a full cup!
Tomorrow night is good. Tomorrow night is good, but uh, y'know what? Why put off something till tomorrow that you can do right now? Eldad come here!
Ohh, she's pretty. Pretty ahh, pretty girl, the pretty--she's pretty.
Wait, we can't do this.
Now, it's not wrapped because I just, just finished it.
There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!
Yeah. Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.
Yes!!!
Oh, this is soo bad.
Well you coulda tried, not kissing him.
Well, I just...
Oh, yeah.
Well I've forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
Well, I'm guessing uh, tonight at the coffee house.
Hey!
Really?
Hey!
Oh, ooh.
Alright I'll tell you what, I'll play you for it.
Yes, yes, but did you see who she was dating?
Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever.
So it did go well.
Unfortunately that is correct.
Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.
Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that I'm sorry. Y'know? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely understand why you were so upset.
Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.
Yeah I even got a ring. Did you get a ring?
Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds.
Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards.
Oh, you do? Because she said you guys havent talked in like years.
Well maybe there is one thing you can do.
Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had.
I see.
What do we do? What do we do?
Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?
It's horrible.
Oh yeah!
Thank you, Joey.
A pen.
Oh God, kindergarten flashback.
Do I look fat?
Okay, okay, but don't worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I'm fairly certain are the same thing.
Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget. Seriously, good luck marrying me.
Just coffee! Where are we gonna hang out now?
Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him. I think somebody should have it.
I just think it's weird, you know? Heckles and me, Heckles, and me, me and Heckles...Would you knock it off?
Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something.
Uh, credit card. Oh no! No-no, but I left my credit card with Joey. Okay, I'll go get it. You guard the ring.
Hello.
Hey!
You're it! Now run and hide!
You know when guys hang out they don't just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?
Ahh, come on! Y'know what-y'know what, I think I'm just gonna go home and call Kathy.
I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic...
And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the Netherlands, right?
What does she do?
Well, you're gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have jobs, and as soon as you do, we're switching it back! There's nothing you can do to stop us! Right, Joe?
We're the Bings.
We're in a relationship?
You can say that because she's not your mom.
Did you hear that?
Okay. But it is officially nighttime.
Okay, here you go. I have two queens, what do you have?
You're definitely scaring here.
Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.
Wish me luck.
Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.
We heard you play all the way from your apartment!
Can I check out what she did to my room?
Althea?! What are you doing?!
Look, she's not backing down! She went like this!
No, I don't.
I'm still on London time, does that count?
Hey, Rach, can I get...
Oh, I would never bet this apartment. It's too nice.
Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one's free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one's free.
Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.
I know, let's rest and drink lots of fluids.
That's great, but shouldn't you be on the toilet right now?
We didn't get to the audition. I'm gonna take her to coffee and then we'll do it then.
This is not out of the blue, this is smack dab in the middle of the blue.
Hi.
Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not.
I'm saying that she... is a devil woman! Y'know I mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I hate her! Well, I don't hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really.
Joey, be a pal. Lift up my hand and smack her with it.
The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
That's what you should say.
Hey, you just wanna forget about raquetball and hang out here?
Cool, girl roommate.
We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!
Oh, don't worry about it I mean you probably were tired, you had a lot of champagne, it happens to everybody.
Hey. Well, you will all be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow night. This woman, Alison, from work. She's great. She's pretty, she's smart. And uh, I've been holding off on asking her out in the past, because she has an unusually large head. But, I'm not gonna let that stuff hang me up anymore. Look at me. I'm growing.
Ginger. I'm talking to Ginger, so....
Okay.
Wherever! I've got like 20!
I can't sleep now.
Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please.
Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!
Multiple, so many paper cuts.
It's my joke.
Check out the ring.
Dying people say the craziest things.
Well, what's the deal with these? These-these look nice.
Yeah, we could do that without y'know risking our lives at all!
Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursday's was just our thing man!
We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
Hi.
No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractive... Hold on one second; let me check this out. (He gets up and grabs a photo album.
Borrow money from me?
Y'know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren't they?
Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!
Y'know uh, you didn't really have to help me pack.
Thank you Rachel.
Well, it'll probably slow it down at first but, once I get used to the extra weight, I'll be back on track.
Joey, I uh! I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.
Oh yeah.
This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.
Okay man.
I like this girl, okay, I seriously like this girl, you now how sometimes I tend get a little defended and quipy...
Stop that now!
Why is that so funny?
I got the time to get to know Julie.
But I love swing music!
Really?
All right, hold on! If you win, we give up the birds.
No.
I'm not seeing Monica.
How much did I love The King and I?
Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight.
He's really picky about his patients.
Alright, what have we learned so far?
Well then maybe you shouldn't go.
Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered.
Nooo.
Well, does that mean that you're not going to wearing yours?
Noo!! You don't have a boyfriend because....I don't, I don't know why you don't have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend.
Alright, so what's it about?
Well that's the brilliance of it. The pretty people... and the running.
Why not?
Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?
Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did not!
Oh my God.
Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me.
No-no-no-no, we're done.
You see you can't tell which one is which either, dwha!!
Joey, can I talk to you for a second?
Okay! So yeah, maybe we can get together umm... Can you hold for one second please? What?!
Come on, tell me.
Uh-huh.
OK, is there a mute button on this woman?
So how are you doing?
Ah! Ahh!! Ahh!!
Who's that?
You're our age!
Aww, thanks man.
This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.
Pheebs! Always a pleasure.
Okay, you are new!
Well, they're Joey's! They gotta be Joey's!
Six-hour trip to London. That's a lot of Monica.
Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!
Know what I mean?
Well the duck can swim.
Those were like the best seats ever.
Oh yeah, it was great. You should be a chef.
What's this?
Ok, think, what would Jack and Chrissy do?
Okay, bye!
Joey, why is your cable out?
Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesn't try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.
Be right there sweetums. A totally different situation.
I'm gonna do it tomorrow y'know, and-and surprise her, but now you've ruined it!
I can't believe it.
Hey, Ben, remember us? Ok, the mole came off.
So um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?
Right.
Well, uh, why don't you ask him yourself. Joey, this is my new roommate Eddie.
Ok, let's do Julie. What's wrong with her?
Hi!
Y'know that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, "You're half Scottish right?"
It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very were gonna be having all the sex.
No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk.
That-that's bad?
Hello children!
Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
Why not?
Look at this. Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with. Look what he wrote on them. Vivian, too tall. Madge, big gums. Too loud, too smart, makes noise when she eats. This is, this is me. This is what I do. I'm gonna end up alone, just like he did.
Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
Ok.
The ball is Janice. The ball is Janice.
So you kissed her, so what happened after that?
Hey guys, what are you doing?
No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.
I wasn't doing anything. Uh-oh, what did she do now?
Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.
She is now.
Okay, excuse me for a minute.
No! No! Not, Paris.
I just saw Janice.
Okay, could you just stop talking for a second? Yemen. That's right, yes, I'm being transferred to Yemen!
Hey it's Joey!
What's going on?
Hey! How'd the interview go?
Picking Rachel.
This isn't one of those uh, y'know "If she doesn't come, we-we don't, we don't come?" Right? Because I already bought my ticket...
Ross, just for my own piece of mind, you're not married to anymore of us are ya?
Y'know Richard...you are a good guy.
We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone. We didn't think we could make it.
Well why didn't you stop her?! Why didn't you just tell her it was a plan?!
Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!
I am, I'm ignoring you.
We should always always break up together.
Okay, is this lamp in the same place?
Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby?
Wait a minute, wait. You're telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn't want you back?!
Joey! No way. I'm not answering that.
Ohh! You guys gonna be living together again?
No! You're the sweetest!
I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke!
Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica that's as good as garbage?
Okay, then you gotta back away, all right? You don't need that kind've hurt. Take it from a guy who's never had a long term relationship......
Isn't that Ross's money?
That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her.
Why don't you use ours across the hall, 'cause she...has...problems.
Oh my God! If you say that one more time, I'm gonna break up with you!
What are you supporting?
Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!
Hey!
You don't think I've tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria.
Well, I, I should go in there.
THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!
Okay!
During this time...are you, are you still my best man?
Hey!
Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?
Yeah let's head off to work.
Uhh, yes, absdolutely, um. Why again?
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! And you are about to marry a wonderful man! Hey! I'm marrying a dead woman!
Hey, he's not crying.
Well, you're not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?
Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.
And say nothing?
Y'know what? There's some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?
See Joe, not that that's not grrreat! But, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! Y'know, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!
All this lying has been hard on us too.
Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...
Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.
Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?
Joey told me, he saw you two kissing.
No, no, no.
Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
Hey!
Hey!
Oh my God!
Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joey's chair?
I know, that, that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid.
Batman has Robin! We get ESPN right?
I asked myself that very question, sir. Uh, this is Monica. This is my boss, Doug. Doug this is Monica.
...I dunno.
Yeah, I'm not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.
That's OK.
It's your mommy. It's your mommy.
Joey you broke my chair!!
Sorry Phoebe.
Woah, hey, yo.
Okay, the old hug and roll.
That new mountain bike?
Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
No-no-no-no-no-no-no, you are not getting me this way.
Lets not do that any more.
Okay.
With extra pulp?
Look, you don't have to draw an actual wo-whoa! She's hot!
Oh, that's The Wedding March. Does, does that freak you out?
I'm not getting into this again!
All right, let's play one more hand! One more!
Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.
Yeah, well... Y'know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?
Wow, you look...
Seriously?
Hey, why don't you wear those earrings I gave you?
Thanks.
No!
Man, didn't she like just get here?
All right, maybe I should call her.
Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game! Last night!
Why?
Hey, Joey, Playboy printed my joke.
Oh, the tears are real.
What?
Okay, so, I'm in Las Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli-
Hey, kids.
Monica is a self-sufficient, together lady. Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and--generosity of spirit.
There is not one hair on that head.
The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.
What did you just do?
Gunther, can I get another cup of coffee, please? So uh, what do you do when you're not working here?
What's wrong? What's wrong? You're married that's what's wrong.
For my last birthday you gave me a hug! Okay, read the card! Read the card!
Elizabeth Hornswoggle?
I'd love it if you would do it.
What happened?!!
Hey!
No I didn't!
No!
Oh, yes. Well it's very beautiful. It's cream-colored and tight I don't mean tight, I mean it's not too tight, not that I was looking at-
I'm not moving out.
No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish.
Oh that's not true! That's not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it... Oh, there was no big dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on it... Her initials...
Okay, fine, $300.
What time is it now?
Yeah me too.
So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called "Invisible things for Kathy." Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?
It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor.
Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
Well it's very unsettling.
What a wank!
Would you please get some rest!
I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?
F-hah.... flennin....
You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.
All right listen, I have to go to the bathroom, but if the place with the big fish comes up again. I'd like know whether that's several big fish or just one big fish.
Y'know what? It's gonna be okay. Y'know what? She's probably not gonna even want to come.
Because it's Sunday. It's God's day.
Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?
...I'm, I'm okay.
Yeah, you're right about that.
Well, couldn't we just lose our virginities again? Ya know, because I think actually mine's growing back.
You told him to play the boxer gay!!
Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You can't offer anything to us!
Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.
If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night.
Come on Chloe! Finish up with your customer first. Come on Chloe! Come on Chloe!!
Goodnight.
Okay.
Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and...
Fine with me!
Yeah!
Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.
Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents!
You're gonna be carrying their baby and give them a Sony Play Station?
Well, can I just...
Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.
No, you're the best.
Do we dare?
Shhh, busy beaming with pride.
Oh, yay...
Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper?
Oh dear God, they gave us glasses!
Oh, we could do this all day.
Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?
Okay, how many of that girl are you seeing?
Oh my God!
Okay.
Nancy Thompson's getting fired!
I'm sorry, who?
It's up to you.
Y'know we already went over this and I won!
Bye.
Well, I guess that's something.
All right!
I'm not even... I'm not even...
You okay there man?
Oh yeah? That's great!
Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.
Any contact?
Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing. Hey Mr. Douglas.
Who are you going out with?
I thought I broke Joey's chair! That's why I replaced it with mine!
That was one of the worse things ever. And not just on TV.
Really?!
Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate.
Okay, 'cause that's not gonna get annoying.
Hey-hey, hey! I don't know why I did that!
Oh-oh-hey!
Don't play with his things.
Yeah, and I don't have any cologne.
I'm a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.
You mean like for award shows?
Oh, this is not that bad.
We are. He's meeting us here.
Yeah, I know what you're thinkin'! Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.
You mean with Casey.
Whoever stood you up is a jerk.
H-He's in China!
Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!
I have to! Okay? It's time! Okay, I hate dogs.
Yeah, it's like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!
Oh, ok.
Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!
No, no, I keep trying, y'know? I can get out, "Joey, I have too..." but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "...go to the bathroom." He may think I'm sick.
Weird world. Your kids?
Alright, let's do this.
Okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. And second, that was not flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. That is all.
I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out.
Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'
Come on! Gary's such a great guy! Whatever the problem is, you can work it out!
Here we go, here we go.
Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you.
Well, Joey's my best friend.
Goodnight.
Hey!!
Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.
There you go!!
Prague?
Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..
Don't worry about it. I'm taking care of it tonight.
Come in!
Oh, just this! Y'know what it's my fault really, because the couch is usually where we keep the varnish.
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!
I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride.
Freedom!
Hey Monica, here's your broom back.
I would really love it if could do both.
We'll watch him.
The young hot ball and chain.
No, no. It-it's not about the swearing, it's more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.
Uhh, 9.
So, this isn't over?
I was not flirting.
Ooh! Ahh, Pheebs, was gonna tell a story.
Well, maybe we can fix it y'know? Maybe we can send him some-some big-big flowers and scare him!
I hope you know what I'm giving up for ya, because she's not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean.
Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here for you later. Hey, how about maroon?
Mustached bastard...
That's correct.
Oh, I just wanted to say, "Hey!"
Well what... Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go over there; I'm gonna kick his ass! Will you help me?!
The reason we haven't told them we're together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?
Well, your gonna need much bigger jars.
...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
Oh the humanity.
Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves.
But it's Ross.
BEND OVER?!!!
I know. Can you believe it? One year ago today I was just your annoying friend Chandler.
Oh, hey.
It's okay, I got a plan.
Oh that's great, my friend Joey's in the movie business.
I'll catch you guys later.
So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?
That's awesome! That's great! What made you do it?!
Happy plane-aversary.
You don't even have a car!
'Kay!
Okay!
Oh, you're-you're going?
Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.
Okay.
Well, what is it?
Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.
I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the "new thing you do that day!" And it starts right now!
Who sold a story to Archie Comics?!
Hi.
Oh! Worm medicine for the duck.
Oh! Look at that, time's up! My turn!
Yeah alright. What're these, raisins?
Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didn't I?
Look guys, I know it's a little steep.
Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother's not going to punch me. Are ya?
Is that Joey?! Let me talk to him!
Hey! Hey, hey-hey, hey.
Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!
Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era.
Well, you do want all that stuff, right?
Double it!
What?
No, I am.
I'm so sorry you're sick.
All right, but I should warn you, I'm not going. I'm going.
Yeah, but uh, it was 1982 and my flock of seagulls haircut was tickling her chin.
Ohhh-hoo, funny story!
Okay.
Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.
Hey!
Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go.
Okay, then get the lobster!
Hey!
I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
Hello children!
Out loud?
Hey! Wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look like a drum.
Oh the phone! The phone's making sounds! Hello!
Really?
Alright.
There you are.
Glass, sand, whatever.
How do ya do.
Oh, you must stop shooping.
Look you don't understand, Gandolf is amazing. Y'know you're never know what's gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple of beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia!
Okay.
Ladies, ladies, let's just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take off Monica's bra.
You know, you think I would.
Yes!
Now why would she say that's embarrassing?
I know!
No, that was Dana Caplin.
You got waaaay too much free time.
Yes have you seen any?
Marcel?!
Hiya doin' pumpkin?
I think I should get the chair!
What's it about?
Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and...
Art lover!
Okay, one thing at a time.
Hey, look, what do you want from me?
He just said, "No strippers."
WENUS. Weekly Estimated Net...
Hey, you know what I was thinking? When we get married, are you gonna change your last name to Bing?
Oh you knew that. Good!
Would you give me one minute!! Please.
What's in the bag?
Wow, he looks so normal.
You didn't think I used to wear glasses, right?
Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?
Oh look, it's the woman we ordered.
Is there a puppy here?
Yeah, we are so sorry.
Maybe 'cause the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm. Look Eddie, isn't there something else you're supposed to be doing right now?
Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow.
Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.
But we don't know the neighbors.
Oh no problem, maybe I'll play with my left hand.
Oh, and don't get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. It's just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it's making all the other guys jealous.
Easy tiger.
No, Stephen Hurs was the kid who would eat anything for money, David Stein was the guy who had no elbows.
They'll never understand!
Okay, here is the thing. We have thrown a very formal surprise party for you in there! All of your friends are in there and your parents!
Hi.
Santa? Really?
Okay. You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!
You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with Janice?
I was shrieking... like a Marine.
I have no name.
What?
Yeah, I heard you and Rachel talking.
It's your timer.
Wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns.
We're going to Everest! Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass print on Everest!
Hey Jo. When'd you start usin' mousse in your hair?
Thank you!
I didn't mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.
Thank you Gunther, put it there. Definitely not easier with coins. Thank you.
He has a gun!
Do you know what I was thinkin'?
Well, I then guess I'm going to Yemen! I'm going to Yemen! When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?
Oh, I'm going on the lamb.
Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday.
The door hasn't been locked in five years, but okay! Ready?!
Can I be that guy?
Hey.
How?
Okay.
Do we have to?
That's sweet.
Oh my god!
Hi, Paul, is it?
Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there's nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening.
Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.
Phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.
I know.
As crazy as soccer?
All right! I found one that fits!
It's my game. You want the job or not?
Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000.
Joey!
I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . Hi. Hey man, we were just doin' some uhh, impressions over here. Do your Marcel Marceau. That's actually good.
Oh yeah, I should probably call them.
Stop it. Stop it!
So, when I woke up this morning, he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes.
Yeah!
Oh, great. This is just...
You don't know?
Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the Year?
They got a phone in there, right?
What's up?
Ohhh!!
Sorry, I just don't like the idea of when I say, "I do," he's thinking, "Yeah, I'd do her too!"
Oh it's Bing, sir. I'm sorry , I was just ah...
That's-that's my nubbin.
Well, you're gonna.
Oh my God! That's why I got up too!
Well, I don't have to break up with her this time. We're not involved! I'm going to do a pre-emptive strike! I'm going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen!
Happy New Year!
All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?
I'm good.
Can we start over?
Me asking is kind of a sign.
Yeah, well...
See uh, that's-that's actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.
Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.
Hey!
This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins.
It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.
Whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her?
I wanna quit the gym.
Rent?
Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?
Have you seen Joey?
Hey!
Nine.
Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie's made some new friends.
Weirder than watching his two moms make out?
Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!
Uhhhaahh.
Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica.
What if I never find someone? Or worse, what if I've found her, but I dumped her because she pronounced it "supposably"?
Well, I'm upset-for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.
Hello, Joanna......'s office.
But we're not ready to tell yet!
So you risked your life, for a sandwich!
Oh uh, when?
I have no idea.
Oh, well...
Okay, we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier.
That's me.
And I don't wanna say this, I don't you guys to hate me, but uh, I don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go. Oh my god!!
Uh, could you leave me one?
And! They like me more just because I was with ya! I think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey. And Doug wants us to play tennis with them. He's never even talked to me outside of work. Except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club. Strip church. Anyway, I'm gonna go try and find a racquet.
OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.
That is so not... That is so not... That... Oh, shut up!
You're right.
Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? I can't figure this out! It's so hard! Should I get her a Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a-ah-ah! Paper cut!
Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and don't talk to anyone.
Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection.
Could I be more sorry.
No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your adult film class.
Lie!!! How hard is that?! The check's in the mail! Oh your baby is so cute! I can't wait to read your book Ross!!
Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is.
Do you know what just happened?
Get off!
We can't do that that's insane. I mean 'A' he could wake up and 'B' y'know, let's go for it.
Were you're parents happy, or something?
Ah, finally an explanation.
Here in Chelsea.
This, this actually is a...
Sure, you guys don't have this problem, you're made of wood. Hey!
Hey, that was really good!
I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And your like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it's kinda like, you're, you know. You know.... You don't know!
No, no, no!
Yes, Janice. Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?
Basically we just feel that he's...
Well, you couldn't have looked everywhere or else you would've found her!
And now I've picked it up again.
Oh right, your allergies. All her, she hates you.
Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not.
What is the thing?
Huh.
Ding dong, the psycho's gone.
Hey, I can be smooth. Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it.
Oh yeah!
Oh, come on! It's not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually I'm pretty much just in there by myself.
I know, but just let me say it.
Oh, don't say that! Don't say that. That's not true. Is it?
I'm going to the bathroom now.
Alright. Yes, this is Rachel.
Oh, what's at 8:00?
Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll-Ups?
Sure!
It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.
I love you.
It's all very, very good. So you wanna go uh, mix it up?
Who?
So what does this mean?
What we did last night was....
Bye-bye.
Wow, you're, you're right. I have a horrible, horrible name.
Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?
Then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back.
Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.
Oh, uh, I... don't... care. Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
Oh, ok.
The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!
That's me! Come on!
Okay.
Oh no, you see, actually it is.
Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.
Oh, well give me the phone then.
All right, there's a nuclear holocaust, I'm the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
Okay.
Oh yes, and that's what I want a roommate that I can walk around with and be referred to as the funny one.
I don't know. Should we try it?
Monica, will you stop? This is nuts. Do you know how long it's gonna be before you actually have to deal with this problem? I mean, you don't even have a boyfriend yet. Joey, she does not look fat.
Wh-what?
"Big guy?"
Oh, sure, they love us over there.
There you go!
All right.
Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times he's wrong.
Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour. That didn't happen, I made that up!
More so than anything else.
Hey!
Yeah, for about 30 minutes.
OK, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson. Joey... three... eight. Eight... three. Alright babe, deal the cards.
Will you marry me? Will you marry me? Hey, you marry me! What's going on little elves?
To my best bud. Thanks best bud.
If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' everybody with me.
How can I answer that when I'm pretending I don't know you?
Yeah.
So Ross, how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?
What?
Really?
Everything's gonna be all right. Okay, Dick?
No! Her boyfriend Richard!
Can I just say one thing?
Hang on buddy!
Stop making candy!
And yet, she's still not hanging up the phone.
So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody who's gonna be in the country like all the time.
Where I don't want to have a relationship ever! I just want to have sex with strippers and my friends!!
Y'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number.
Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.
Oh no-no-no, I'm, I'm paddling away!
It came up.
Welcome home man.
All right. Look, I'm gonna go in here, and you don't buy me anything ever.
Well, maybe it was God, doing me.
Hmm.
Can you hear that?
Well then why can't I see it?
Okay!
All right, Janice, likes him. In fact she likes him so much she put him on her freebie list.
Im just trying to find the right moment, you know?
Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve.
Wow, I don't know what to say. Wow, I, I don't know what to say.
Yeah, well, sorry doesn't bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home! I hate this stupid day! And everything about it! I'll see you later.
Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day!
Now this feels like Thanksgiving.
We wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story!
No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!
So.... I quit.
Hey.
Yeah, I'm not sure I can do that.
Maureen Rosilla.
We don't need to remedy that.
No! No! I support you 100%! I just didn't, I didn't get it right away. Y'know now I'm caught up! Identical hand twins! It's a million-dollar idea!
Okay, so he's out of here.
So?
You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?
No, it's not like, like Phil Spiderman. He's a spider, man. Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but there's no Gold Man.
Yeah, well. It's the right thing to do.
Okay, okay, here she comes! How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesn't want to get married?
Hey!
Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.
Oh my God!
Oh, so that's why the priest threw holy water on me. Okay, listen, you have to cheer up! Okay? You should come out with Ross and me, I mean anything is better than sitting around here crying all day about Kate.
Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?
Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!
You ready?
Hey!!
Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm.
And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor. And might I say your breasts are still showing.
Nah, Phoebs, that's the guy that comes in the frame.
So, uh, how was he?
Does South Oregon have a sports-team? There you go.
Okay.
Right now, right here. Don't ya think we're in kind of a public plaaaa They do have the shrimp.
You just, you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body!
It's alright. Is she good-looking?
I can't believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!
How drunk are you?
Look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later.
Hey, y'know what? Why don't we think about changes we can make in the living room?
Dude! That's my girlfriend!
Do I ever.
Jeez, man did you fall.. Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?
Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!
Yeah, I'm gonna stick with the ring. Oh, this one's nice! I like this one! Sir? Uh, kind sir? Can I see this one?
Well, how could anyone not be in love with Yasmine Blepe?
Uh, yeah.
Oh, by the way, that is her full name.
I can't seem to say goodbye.
I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.
Umm, how's it going with you guys?
From a bullet!
What picture?
Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.
How do you know?!
She's not as pretty as she was when she was 29.
That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!
We already knew that!
Why would I be mad?
Good save! We're back on track, and I'm... ..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking.
Why must everybody watch me sleep? There'll be no more watching me sleep, no more watching.
What was tonight?
No. Not anymore.
That, that is funny. Can I have it back?
Yeah.
I thought you were gonna be gone all day.
I confronted her, and she didn't deny it! I don't live here!
Scotch on the rocks, with a twist, on a coaster? Ha-ha, Monica! Monica!
So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?
Well, if I was wearing your underwear then, uh, what would you be wearing?. . . You're swell.
Oh, I'm fine about my problem now, by the way.
So what happened?
Hi Joey's sisters!
And uh, you don't have a mustache which is good. I'm Chandler; I make jokes when I'm uncomfortable.
Love her! That's right, I...LOVE...HER!!! I love her!! I love you, Monica.
Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but y'know I-I think this is a good thing. Y'know? 'Cause we've had our first fight, and now we can move on. Y'know, I know for me- Nick's pants?
So, you busy Thursday?
So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class.
Okay and he hasn't proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.
Really?
So what job did you get Joe?
That's a low one!
Hi.
Oh, seriously you want him?
I've got five bucks says you can't.
Okay.
Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke--Diet Coke.
Yeah, we got, um-hmm.
Hey!
Guys! Guys! Come on! It's Thanksgiving, it's not important who wins or loses. The important thing is, the Dutch girl picked me! Me! Not you! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!!
Drop off my dry cleaning. Pick up my vitamins. Teach me how to spell vitamins. Wear in my new jeans.
Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.
Oh that's so sweet! I want to show you something too!
Janice?!
Because it's flattering! Come on Monica! Come on Monica!
What'd you rent?
Ohhh Oh no, wait a minute, I have no one.
No-no, not something stupid, something huge.
You said no right?!
I'll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.
Hi.
Okay, well he totally screwed up the punch line. Y'know, it's supposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh.
This isn't your first surprise party, is it sir?
Yeah.
I majored in lightning rounds. All right, we're gonna destroy you.
Condoms?
They're still just friends, right?
Believe me, I've been saying that for years. Oh my God!
So, what are you gonna do?
Come on, you're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.
Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went.
Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go.
Yeah, but I bet it works.
Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip Joe.
Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.
No I'm serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you.
No. No. I don't think so.
But are you sure you can do this?
I hope he did!
Because if I go home, we're gonna become the Bings! I can't be the Bings!
Oh totally! Pull my finger.
Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. Little tip: if youre ever in a similar situation, never ever leave your hand... ..on the desk.
Hi! I'm back. Yeah, that sounds great. Okay. Well, we'll do it then. Okay, bye-bye.
Yeah, and at the end of the play, he, he got up y'know, and he just started like, banging his hands together!
Hey, gorgeous.
Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. We should take a trip.
Joey? Got you a Joey Special, two pizzas! Joe? Hello? Damnit! Hello? No, Joey's not here right now, but I can take a message I think. He's still got a chance for the part?! Oh, that's great news! Well no obviously not for the actor who was mauled by his dog. Oh well, that's great. I will give Joey the message. Thank you! Yes! Okay, Mac audition at 2:00. Allergy actor attacked. By dog not flowers.
Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever...
We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la .
Yeah, it's annoying, isn't it?
So, you feel like goin' for a run?
Okay.
Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
It was a car backfire!
I am proud of all my friends today.
We're very happy for you.
What's the matter honey?
Okay.
He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.
I'll talk to them!
Like an eclipse.
The abridgment.
It was working until you showed up, you big tree! I mean, this isn't fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other! And this is all just been one stupid mistake! I was gonna propose tonight.
Really, bitchin'!
Hey look, are we gonna have to bring this out every time Ross comes over?
Oh, he's in the back. The duck pissed him off, said that eggs came first.
Yeah, she, she brought the invisible cab. . . hop in.
What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
Well, you want me to uh, clench anything, or-... Susie? Susie.
Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, they can meet Krog!
Well, it's just the reason that I'm asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable to-I mean I really wanted too, but I couldn't.... There huh-hmm, there-there was an incident.
Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.
Made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at 11:30 if we both had the chicken and didn't get desert.
Eh!
Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.
Richard!
Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn? "You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."
Maybe that's because soy-burgers suck!
So...
Hey, Mon.
Just tryin' somethin' here, ya know.
Uh-oh.
Here.
Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why women won't look at me.
All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?
Did you not hear me say, "Du-ude?!"
I said art lover.
Kick save and... denied.
Hey, does anybody need anything copied? I'm going down to the Xerox place.
It is?
Wow!
What?
No-no-no-no!
Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.
Yeah. So do we need to hug here or. . .
Look at this!
Whose is it?
Well, let's just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.
Yeah.
The man's got a point.
Cups.
Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the bride's maid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, you're not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya?
Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, what are we going to do about my job?
She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!
Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that's because I didn't send him an invitation.
Oh hey Rachel, sweetheart? You have got to tell the post office that you have moved. Okay? We are still getting all your bills and stuff.
Well seeing that drunk Santa wet himself, really perked up my Christmas.
Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!
Hey, I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and Emily, and I think that's, I think that's really cool.
Hmm, let's see if it comes up this time.
Wow that was my scariest voice! You're very brave.
To the left, to the left- aww!
Like?
Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. Bye-bye. Oh God!
Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.
Y'know you, really didn't have to take me to the airport.
Okay, I'll give them back. Look! What is so great about that sandwich?
What?
Thank you, buddy.
Oh! Oh! That's so hard.
Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
Oh, it's a website, it's the, uh, the Guggenheim museum. See, she likes art, and I like funny words.
Orange juice.
I have no idea.
Oh my good God.
Oh yes!
No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg.
Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment.
What happened?!!
Yeah.
Okay...
Is it--?
'Kay!
Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy.
I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y'know he's the botanist.
It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.
Buy it for ya, or win it for ya?
I, I'm sorry, I uh I already have a roommate.
I don't know what to say. I'm sorry that we make more money than you. But we're not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it.
And that's how you bought it?
Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high.
Ok, that's Eric.
Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly you're having sex with him.
Say again?
I am sorry, Ross.
Yes.
Okay, give me a second! Did you clean up in here?
You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?
I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr. Peanut than Mr. Salty.
No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they are.
What's going on?
Bye! Thank God
He is?
Yes indeedy! With a beautiful view of...
Oooh, Rich is goin' to the party too, huh?
Oh, yay...
Damn! The tailpipe's not hot enough to light this!
All right.
Oh, I can uh, check that for ya.
Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...
Hey Joe.
Yes!
Oh yeah, I totally agree.
Hey.
That's funny, I saw no phlegm.
Okay, wait. All right, that's it, okay, I'm out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore!
Oh that's all right fellas, I saw a kitchen this morning - on TV. Stop talking. OK.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with, and the other one can't get mad.
Aww, I love you so...
Oh.
No. Is there anyway, anyway you think he'll understand this?
I do like that.
And a date with a man!
Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she's celebrating that by going on a date with him.
Oh o-, OK man.
Okay, listen this really hurts. Let's go.
Run, Joey! Run for your life!
I could die.
Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.
Do we pay for this?
Yeah, for about 30 minutes.
Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?
Well, you still havent taken down the Christmas lights.
Well good, good for you. You really think that Roger is the perfect guy?
Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is having one of her boobs redused. It's a whole big boob story.
Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!
Oh yeah? Joshua, give me a call sometime, guys like you never go out of style-what did you throw away?
I-never borrowed your Walkman.
Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.
It's a great idea.
Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.
Oh, Richard. That's all I ever hear, Richard, Richard, Richard!
Yeah. Right.
Oh great, food with hair on it.
Steps! Slut! You will all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!
Okay! That's a four! And where-where's the other one?
Y'know I think you can take her.
I walk into a room and he won't even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.
Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!
Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now.
You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kinda true.
Oh all right.
Yeah I just... wanted to call and say hey.
I am only one man! Okay Ross, time is up!
Hey Phoebs, can I have the milk after you?
Three!
Wow! Listen, we had a good run. What was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then!
No freakshow, she's fictional.
That was in the fourth grade. How could you still be upset about that?
Hello? Hello?
We're doomed. Okay, they're gonna take 50 bucks out of our accounts for the rest of our lives. What are we gonna do?
Hi.
You-you do?
Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!
C'mon, there's nothin' to see, it's just a tiny bump, it's totally useless.
Bullies, big bullies.
Yeah. No. No...
Me.
So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?
Where?
Um, is it sugarless?
Airplane! Airport! Airport '75! Airport '77! Airport '79!
Okay, here's the situation. The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.
He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself! Without any outside help whatsoever.
Yeah?
Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?
No, did he hug you?!
The doctor.
Okay, so I guess that's about ah, two weeks before the topless thing kicks in.
Hey.
Oh my God that's it, that's the ring! How much is it?
Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.
Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to Brooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!
Why?
Oh that's right. It's your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?
Really?
Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?
Toootal chick-flick.
Was his question what's more boring than him?
Okay, listen, how far am I gonna have to go with her?
Well, you-you know what I meant.
That guy's going home with a note!
Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I'll stop seeing her?
And you're gonna make them all disappear.
Aww.
Well I do, but uh, Eddie makes them this way and, well they're pretty darn good.
Yes! Well that-yes.
Ohhh.
You, move out. Take your fruit, your stupid small fruit and GET OUT!
Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game.
Oh, the mixed tape.
Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia.
Not even on page 7?
He's not gonna make it, he's stuck in Chicago.
All right, should we just, should we just get married? Y'know? I mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it.
Yeah, he's really excited about it too, he even recorded show times on his answering machine.
But those are the words! Those exact words!
What, what's what you mean?
Yes, if it really doesn't mean anything, because you know that I'm just not ready...
Yeah, it's a very large plane.
When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!
Hey, y'know what we can do? Y'know, now that we are up? We can just like talk to each other all night long, y'know like we did when we were first going out. It'd be fun!
He took my essence!
Oh that's so funny because we found someone too.
Bob here.
Yeah, why not. So I told her.
Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still feel bad?
Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!
Oh, so that's what this is for.
Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!
So, what're you gonna do?
Not if I kiss you first.
I found a dried up seashores.
Really?!
C'mon, we're roommates! My eyes!! My eyes!!
Hey!
The one time they're not home.
Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!
What? What? What?
I sure did.

Who said anything about Christmas?
Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break?
Well, I have a call in about that.
Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.
Hey!
If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel.
Aww, man!
To her face? Look it's the end of the date, I'm standing there, I know all she's waiting for is for me to say 'I'll call her' and it's just y'know, comes out. I can't help it, it's a compulsion.
Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.

Ahhhh, you're not Mary-Angela.
It is so good to see you!
Oh my good God.
So um, Mary-Angela, what's your second favorite?
Well that's not an, even a real fish. No, that's a goldfish cracker.
Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing. Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'! Don't worry, those are the right letters.
No, no, you don't have to see.
Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed.
Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.
I'm hangin in. . . and a little out.
Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?
Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.
All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?

Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something.
Hey.
Okay, so this time I won't quit!
Oh no, you'll have to come.
