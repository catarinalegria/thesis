One more game?
Oh, my, god!
If this is the way all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a problem.
Hey!
Not 700 exactly?
Yeah all right. Okay, good night guys.
Hey, y'know what? Why don't we think about changes we can make in the living room?
Hey.
Hi! Hi. Okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store, the ring you're about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. So, I'm gonna need to have that back. But, in exchange I'm willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring. Ew.
Well, that's the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I'll be in Cuba.
Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.
Mma, Mma, Mmaah
Hi. We're the guys who called about the baby. We left the baby on ths bus. Is he here? Is he here?
Wow, that's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?
So you really OK about all this?
So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know.
You want it?
I'm so sorry you're sick.
When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.
All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
Alright, I hope you realize you're not getting these underpants back.
Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!
Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?
Never!
No, no, you don't have to see.
No. No! No! No!
Oh you wouldn't uh, care. It's just a stupid comic book story.
This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor?
Uh-oh.
Not even on page 7?
Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's lunch, who? Ross Geller's lunch, please don't take me. Okay?
Really!
I also said, "Yes!"
Uh-huh.
I am here, on my knees, holding up these couch cushions as a symbol of my sorrow and regret, much like they did in biblical times. Though you may haveth anger now. . .
Dude! Dude!
Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means we're unhappy forever. Sound good?
Yeah, I do.
Ok, good night. You big freak of nature.
I just saw Janice.
What? What can't you do?
There you are.
Ring dammit, ring!
Mr. and Mrs. Bing!
: I thought we had them!
Nobody is opening anything ok? Look, I don't know about you guys, but I wanna see the look on Monica's face when I give her my present, and I'm sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just, can we put them back?
I'm talking about you. You big, big freak.
Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.
All right, that's it, give me your underwear.
And you're gonna make them all disappear.
With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.
Well let's....let's see what everybody thinks of that?
Okay, one thing at a time.
Monica said wedding.
That's great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.
Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?
Course there, they just call it food.
What do you mean, like, buy it together?
Yeah, like in a cab...
Well, I don't have to break up with her this time. We're not involved! I'm going to do a pre-emptive strike! I'm going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen!
Look, Ross, you have what you want, you're back with Rachel. If you bring this up now you're gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.
Well, thanks man. Now I can get my pony.
'Scuse me.
What check thing?
Long!
Still terrified, I'll take care of it. No problem.
Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!
Oh yes.
I think it's the dying cat parade.
Oh, we could do this all day.
Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?
Go.
Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
We have to leave for New York in an hour.
Thanks for trying. Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!
I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.
No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk.
I'm off the list.
Yeah, and not that you would, but I wouldn't hang out with...all the guys in my office.
Hey.
Ross is Batman!
I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!! You are surprisingly strong!
There we go!
All right, how about we, how 'bout we sell it.
I'm coming already!!
All right, you will notice that I am fully dressed. I, in turn, have noticed that you are not. So in the words of A. A. Milne, "Get out of my chair, dillhole!"
What is going on here?
Do you mind if we stick you in another cabinet? They seem all right with it!
Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that.
OK, stop.
Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause I like to be surprised.
Aww, turkey! Aww, giving thanks! Aww!
Is there a puppy here?
What about that circled one?
Oh well, we don't because we got...the...other pl-place.
Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board! I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya! I went to Ross's! I went to the coffeehouse! I went to any place that they made sandwiches!
Hey!
No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.
Pheebs, we're not giving you a deposit for our wedding!
No-no, he's not back yet, but he'll be here any minute. So uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?
But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, y'know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, she'd be surprised!
I bet he can.
Y'know what, I'm gonna uh, play the field just a little more.
Oh my God!
Monica...
I can't take the big white dog! You love it!
I could use the money; it could give me time to write.
Sure, I'll do it with ya.
Okay.
Oh my God! Oh my God!
All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!
Okay, but if you can't...no dinner!
Hey!
Bored and bored!
Hey, how'd it go? How'd she like the gift?
Thanks.
Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less.
Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, it's the only chance to see New York.
We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.
I got it! Scotch... tape.
The man is showing brain.
Condoms?
Yeah, that's like the most ugliest dress I've ever seen. Wh-why do you to return it?
She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!
Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did not!
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm trppd in an ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr.
OH...MY...GAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? You didn't tell her we were getting married, did you?
Kinda. They're really big.
What's wrong? What's wrong? You're married that's what's wrong.
Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!
Oh right, your allergies. All her, she hates you.
No, sir.
Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had.
I see.
Susie Moss, right, yeah, wow, you look. . . great job growing up.
It's alright. Is she good-looking?
They're in my bag over there.
Which smells delicious!
Kick save and... denied.
Yes, back then I, uh, used humor as a defense mechanism. Thank God I don't do that anymore.
Joey told you about the leg, huh?
All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!! Pipe-pipe-pipe down! What is the matter with you people?! This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you, and I'll bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right?
We are bad people.
Do we pay for this?
I know, this is a great apartment.
You tell me! Maybe, it's because I was just fooling with my ex! Oh no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, that was you!!
Well, I guess thats why they call it psychology, sir.
I was asleep. Oh no! No-no honey! Y'know what's sexy? Layers. Layers are sexy. And blankets are sexy. And oh! Hot water bottles are sexy.
Nice!
No, no, no, no, no!
Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?
Oh my God!
Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?
Sure, you guys don't have this problem, you're made of wood. Hey!
No, he visited a little town south of throw up. So what was Phoebe's secret?
I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.
Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh, great book and you are the queen of everything.
Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow.
We already knew that!
Look you don't understand, Gandolf is amazing. Y'know you're never know what's gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple of beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia!
That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?
Thank you, Joey.
Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.
Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth.
Not if I kiss you first.
Oh yes!
Get off!
You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!
Yeah.
Lovely!
What a sweet story.
Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went.
Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow.
Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey.
He's open!
Yeah, not bad right? You know what, Monica's gonna be working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know what else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who wouldn't wanna live with me?
Yeah.
The ball is Janice. The ball is Janice.
G'night.
I know.
All right.
By me?
Maybe, isn't she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?
But you found me!
Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.
Richard! No one supposed to know about us! See I, did it again.
Yep, pretty much.
Okay. It's not different at all, is it?
Yeah, I know but...
Consider Casey.
Well, they're Joey's! They gotta be Joey's!
Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.
Oh, I couldn't be happier.
Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.
No.
Daddy. All right look, here's the story. Well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was really steamy. So I take off my glasses and that's when in happened.
Something else I might have said?
That would be impossible to resist if you weren't all drippy here.
Oh, sure, they love us over there.
I have some moves.
Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...
Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, y'know I've always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.
That's OK.
Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.
All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?
Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars.
Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever...
No, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And this alarm started going off in my head 'Run for your life! Get out of the building!'
Oh God!
That's... That's was...
Put Joey on the phone.
Bye. Are you still out there?
I would but mine doesn't fit. The pants are a little tight.
Or... Dick.
We can talk about that.
Hey.
Well okay Jerry, thanks for stopping by.
Look, I may have jumped the gun here. Um, I just got out of a relationship and I'm not really in a, in a commitment kind of place.
So in your whole life, you've only been with one oh.
What are you guys talking about?
I had about a mugful in this lovely 'I got boned at the Museum of Natural History' mug.
You can be the best man when I get married.
All right, but I should warn you, I'm not going. I'm going.
Yes I did, and I think you should do it.
Okay.
I found a dried up seashores.
Look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later.
No, that was Dana Caplin.
How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!
Oh, but it's not 'til tomorrow!
Well I like both eggs equally.
Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.
The nerve huh?
Hey.
I'm gonna put on some music.
Oh, seriously you want him?
Oh yes, sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro? Please let them win!
Who was it?
I love you. And I know about the baby.
Hello, Joanna......'s office.
Do you know what just happened?
Well that was before all the vaporizing action.
Sorry, I just don't like the idea of when I say, "I do," he's thinking, "Yeah, I'd do her too!"
But I'll tell you something. One of these days we're get off of our buts and rent Die Hard again!
Y'know, I forgot the combination to this about a year ago? I just carry it around. Do you have any Chap Stick?
I'm telling ya, Joanna's got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, 'This was fun. Let's do it again sometime. I'll give you a call.'
Now why would she say that's embarrassing?
That was amazing!
Hi.
Well, it's like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake.
Dog grooming huh? Okay, just don't make my tail too poofy.
Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!
What?!
Okay, a little announcement, a little announcement. I've decided that my best man is, my best friend Gunther!
And you're upset because you didn't make your best friend cry?
Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..
I'll be a fool for you. I'm sure, you know I don't mind.
Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack!
No, no, see? See? Hey, it's printing. Hey, it's printing!
What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie.
Aww, I love you so...
Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!
Okay, give me a second! Did you clean up in here?
Ross?
No I didn't!
Hey, yo.
No, Stephen Hurs was the kid who would eat anything for money, David Stein was the guy who had no elbows.
See now it feels like Christmas!
Excuse, I seem to have dropped my ball.
If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel.
Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out.
Don't go.
Hey.
Should we call the spitter?
What?
No, no, no.
Oh yeah, but don't worry. I don't think anybody's gonna focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress.
He's finally happy with that and walks away.
Joey was in a porno movie.
That's not really important right now. What is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just don't feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.
Well it's just while Monica and I were dancing to them it was...the first time I knew that...you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.
Let's go.
Monica, will you stop? This is nuts. Do you know how long it's gonna be before you actually have to deal with this problem? I mean, you don't even have a boyfriend yet. Joey, she does not look fat.
Joe. Joe! Answer the phone.
Uh Joe, when it's one o'clock in the morning and you don't come by? That's okay!
Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again. Today, I'm, I'm smoking still.
Well, we're-we're hanging out in here!
No they didn't!
Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?
Hey.
Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames.
Yeah, either that, or Gloria Estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm is going to get you.
Hello!
Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?
I did! But the store wouldn't take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?
Oh! Yeah!
Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo.
Ni-hi-ice!
What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
All right, I took the quiz, and it turns out, I do put career before men. Get up.
What happened?!!
Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. Um, it's going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! We're not even sure why we're having it.
I think you smell great!
You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!
No! No! No! No--one can beat me.
For my last birthday you gave me a hug! Okay, read the card! Read the card!
I'm an alien. I'm an alien.
Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty. Yep.
No we didn't!
Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn't come yet.
Oh, this is not that bad.
Well maybe you should put some ice on it.
Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac's sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe's friends with Rachel. And that's the trail, I did it!
Well, actually it's a hockey team, so it's angry Canadians with no teeth.
Hey!
Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?
That's totally understandable.
All right.
How can I answer that when I'm pretending I don't know you?
Well, I don't really know what that is, but let's!!
See Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed.
Well, why don't you tell her to stop being silly!
Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting.
Okay.
Nice camoflauge man, for a minute there I almost didn't see ya.
Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!
Really? Male nurses?
So how's Mindy?
All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?
They put you in jail?
Thanks Joey, that's a good idea.
Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm anything but a dropper.
What?
Hey!
Oh that's great, with my luck, that's gonna be him.
Done.
Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... ...now I wish I was dead.
Hello!
Okay! So yeah, maybe we can get together umm... Can you hold for one second please? What?!
You're turning into a women.
Uhhuh, how did you know that?
Okay, what do you guys think?
Oh yea yea, absolutely.
She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?
See, I told you they don't swim.
Out of my league. I could get a Brian. If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. Hey, Brian.
Are you all right?
Yeah, well, I don't dance at weddings.
May I help you?
Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot.
We're notwe're not saying anything.
Me too!
Yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it.
I don't want him to tell this story for years.
Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine.
Hey, you just wanna forget about raquetball and hang out here?
Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom.
Thanks.
Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?
Hey.
See, that's why we don't let her play.
All right, Pheebs, back me up here, ok? You believe in that karma crap, don't you?
Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!
Janice is gonna go away now.
Oh my God! Who's gonna watch that?!
Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter fluid-Op! Op!
Well, we're really not that close. Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.
Nice try.
Oh, then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it.
Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft.
There it is! So what're you gonna do?
We've got to do something!
There's another carton right over there.
Like finding money with naked people on it!
Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her.
Petrie, right, right. Okay, some people gonna be working this weekend.
Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate.
Fancy.
That was one of the worse things ever. And not just on TV.
She doesn't know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this morning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. And now I can't even return them, because she choked on the reciept!
Sounds like a date to me.
Noo.
Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? I can't figure this out! It's so hard! Should I get her a Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a-ah-ah! Paper cut!
What?
Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.
Okay, one question.
You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool! I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing. Anyway we're talking about your dream. I love you. Your dream?
Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax.
Hey!
Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park and hit rocks at...bigger rocks. Hey Rach, do you have a tennis racquet?
No, it's not! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monica's face when I gave it to her, y'know? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye. Look, this is the most important thing I'm gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure it's perfect.
Yeah, we could do that without y'know risking our lives at all!
And I'm cute too.
Well I'm not showing you my 'tat.'
So she's just waiting over there for ya?
Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
But we should take it.
Yuck!
Hey.
Well, you're gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have jobs, and as soon as you do, we're switching it back! There's nothing you can do to stop us! Right, Joe?
Oh-ho-ho, I don't think so!
Hey, come on, give me a break, I'm out on a limb here.
Oh, so that's why the priest threw holy water on me. Okay, listen, you have to cheer up! Okay? You should come out with Ross and me, I mean anything is better than sitting around here crying all day about Kate.
That's a good call. Right.
Tonight? You-you didn't say it was going to be at nighttime.
Okay, you get her in here. You bolt the door. I'll be in the closet.
OK Phoebs, how many do you want?
Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."
Unwilling to steal from work, interesting.
Because it's Sunday. It's God's day.
It is so good to see you!
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that? I kinda have a dream! I don't want to talk about it.
Gary, I'm here to report a crime.
Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...
Well, have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for?
No!
Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she's celebrating that by going on a date with him.
No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.
That new mountain bike?
Pheebs! We have to take you to the hospital now!
Why two?
Really?!
Her ankle is what you're watching?
Doug!!
And then the peacock bit me. Please kiss me at midnight.
Alright, whoever this is, stop calling me! It's been six months! It's not funny!
So, you feel like goin' for a run?
Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River.
Did you not understand the story?
Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights.
There's the man.
Oh, I'm Ross. I'm Ross. I'm too good for the Hut; I'm too good for the Hut.
Stripping!
Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?
Y'know I think you can take her.
Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?
I broke up with her.
Well, couldn't we just lose our virginities again? Ya know, because I think actually mine's growing back.
Oh that's so funny because we found someone too.
Could there be more Kims?
I'm sorry man.
OK, I don't, I don't mind the last pound. OK, in fact I kind of like the last pound. OK, so don't make me do anything that I'll regret.
Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day!
Well, it is overdue.
Yes.
Oh yeah, it was great. You should be a chef.
Okay. Thanks.
Hey.
What's this?
How do you know?!
We're going to Everest! Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass print on Everest!
See ya.
Are you Joey?
Tell it again. Seriously.
Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.
No.
Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing. Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'! Don't worry, those are the right letters.
Bye. I can't stand the woman!
Man, this is...
More importantly, was I any good?
Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.
Okay Ross, why don't you come with me?
I'm not getting into this again!
I just came over to drop off...nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?
Uh, yeah.
Ohh.
Don't worry, I'm brave! I am brave! I...I am brave! No-no-no-no!! Can you tell me who is there please?
No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?
Yes that was a nice place!
I'll teach ya! Come on, come on, it's really easy and really, really fun.
No, I almost did, couldn't leave Ross there without a spotter!
Well, you could also give back the money you owe me.
I thought I broke Joey's chair! That's why I replaced it with mine!
Well, y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as... Ahh, what?
Oh, great. This is just...
No, I have a great idea for a present for her.
Janice's birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me.
Of course it is. Wow-whoa!
No, no, Phoebs. You know why? Cause he's dead.
Then it's okay!
Ah, you're still just a little fat girl inside aren't you?
No. But uh, Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time.
Why is your family Ross?!
Ah, finally an explanation.
And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something. Okay? Something huge!
Oh, uhh, actually I uh, have some news.
Do you have my credit card?
Beam me up Jesus.
I can't believe she cracked your code!
Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special. Y'know, technically we still are over international waters.
Hello. Hi, Janice! Can you hold on for a second? Okay. Okay, what do I do?
What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.
I'm a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.
We heard you play all the way from your apartment!
No problem roomie.
All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racist jokes now?!
No I didn't!
No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.
Okay! So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?
Monica...
Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum!
Wish me luck.
So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it take for the roller skating thing to happen.
So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody who's gonna be in the country like all the time.
Where?
Ahhhh-I'm not going to call you.
Love your condoms my man.
Hey!
I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!
Ow, no 'woo-hooing,' no 'woo-hooing.'
OK, is there a mute button on this woman?
What was that?
So, uh, wh-where ya from?
Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 8:00.
Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now.
Aw, don't do that
What?!
No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
I thought you were gonna be gone all day.
Then, I don't get it.
Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?
Oh, I'll go out and get you some.
Well what... Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go over there; I'm gonna kick his ass! Will you help me?!
Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.
Whose is it?
Love her! That's right, I...LOVE...HER!!! I love her!! I love you, Monica.
See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.
Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap. Seriously.
No, you should.
Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.
To my best bud. Thanks best bud.
Eldad is much more cooperative! And he can dance! You dance for Rachel!
Well where did she go?
Sorry, I just...can't sleep. Ooh! Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time I look at that cover I'm like...
Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?
Um, is it sugarless?
So you understand, I'd feel a lot more comfortable if you didn't tell people what happened. Y'know, I'm a little...I'm a little embarrassed about it.
Hey! Which one's my turkey burger?
Well, I did not know that.
Okay, how many of that girl are you seeing?
And then he did.
Hey, big guy, game time.
Oh you got a wedding dress? That's great!
Hey.
Steps! Slut! You will all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!
That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her.
Really.
Yes, this, this was pleasant.
Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush.
Hey, Joey, Playboy printed my joke.
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! Yes, the groom-No! Not the groom!!
Can you figure out what I'm doing?
Ah, Kim Basinger, Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry, Yasmine Bleeth, and ah, Jessica Rabbit.
No! Shhh!
Yeah.
Oh, well give me the phone then.
WHAT IS IT?!
What are the odds? What are the odds?
Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo. I added the "a-gogo."
Yes! Well that-yes.
Oh, just this! Y'know what it's my fault really, because the couch is usually where we keep the varnish.
What?
Yes! Good thing we have that, 'Not in New York' rule.
Hey!
Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.
Ohh! You guys gonna be living together again?
There's a Phoebe on my sandwich!
Look, when I've been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly, and I'm sorry.
So, what do you thing the good news is?
I know.
Ladies, ladies, let's just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take off Monica's bra.
Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers. Y'know, for you, and... I left the door open and she must have gotten out and I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof, which FYI Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. I couldn't find him, and I am so, so, so, sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain.
Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection.
Hey!
I had too okay?! We're getting married! Married couples can't keep secrets from one another!
Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?
Hey!
Oh my good God.
Night-night.....Janice. 'Look at all that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there. That would be weird though. Okay, hug and roll time. I'm huggin', I'm huggin', your rollin', and....yes! Freedom! Except for this arm! I'm stuck. Stuck arm! Okay, time for the old table cloth trick, one fluid motion. Quick like a cat, quick like a cat! And 1...2...3!'
Man, didn't she like just get here?
"Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." Nice!
No, no, this is the first time.
Oh, God.
I think they get it.
Okay!
Hey.
Alright, alright, alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!
Hey!
Hey.
Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay.
Which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year.
Fun's over!
That's not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don't say that I don't have goals!
Well, stuff like where'd we live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on it's collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.
So what do you say, maybe sometime I hold your gun?
That's Mr. Girabaldi playing the piano.
Hey!
I'm here to see Mary-Angela.
Nice!
Ohh.
All right, hold on! If you win, we give up the birds.
No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!
That's true!
Really?
That is true.
Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done.
All right, ready?
Oh, you don't want me on the trip?
Just tryin' somethin' here, ya know.
Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?
Can you hear that?
Okay. And it's not just chicks y'know? It's all kinds of other animals!
You done?
No reason.
You look great!
Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.
Hey, he's not crying.
You do owe me so much. You owe me three thousand, four hundred...
Okay we have to do something about your breath.
You guys wanna eat here?
I know what you're thinking, Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's.
Two fours.
Thanks
Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident?
That's what you got me?
Well.... it is amouz-ing...
Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!
What's an identical hand twin?
So it did go well.
I have no idea.
....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store.
Buh-bye. I just got us reservations at Michelle's and tickets to the Musicman to celebrate our first holiday season as a betroughed couple.
Y'know what? It seems like all of the sudden; so much has happened.
Well you did pull his hair.
Yes he did.
Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs.
Well, my apartment isn't there anymore, because I drank it.
Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.
Wouldn't that be Frank the III?
Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it.
Excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos?
Well it's just my entire family was run out of Scotland by...Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.
Don't look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel!
Can we start over?
Step away from the duck.
I am so, so, so, so sorry!
Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car.
Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get me straight through the week.
No.
You be cool.
Oh sweet Moses.
I think I do! Thank you, Monica.
Oh, okay, thanks.
Oh that's all right fellas, I saw a kitchen this morning - on TV. Stop talking. OK.
Du-ude!
I know, but just let me say it.
Oh come on guys, it's not like I moved to Europe! I just moved across the hall! And we would have you over all the time if it weren't for Monica's allergies. You're right, I could never lie to you. She hates you. Should I get that? Hello? Uh no, Joey's not here right now. Can I take a message? Yeah, okay so the audition has been moved from 5:00 to 2:30? Okay great. Bye.
I can't help it!
Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, I'll be your boyfriend.
Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?
Wait! Wait! We'd really love it if you could be there.
Yeah, I-I-I think so. Yeah, I-I think so...
I'm not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.
Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.
Like an eclipse.
Yeah alright. What're these, raisins?
I can't talk to you now, I gotta find Monica!
Do you have any beers? We're out of beers.
Oh yeah, it's so cool. Now I gotta go, Officer Bing has gotta, 10-100. That's pee-pee.
What?
So I'm not, not gonna lose her?
Well, I think it all started when you said, "Hey Joey, why don't you be my best man."
Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?
Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.
Seven times!
All right, I'll pick that one.
Yeah!
See Joe, we want you to tell stories but y'know, romantic stories. Nice stories.
Yes.
This is ridiculous.
Oh, well, ah... maybe thats because theyre ah... jealous, of us.
I made that joke up.
Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!
But...
Wait! You're going out with Kathy!
Me too!!
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.
Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesn't mean anything.
Yes!
Get in here! Hey, and you can not smoke in here! Merry Christmas.
No-o-o! No? No-o-o! Look Joey, here's the thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, I'm gonna be moving out man.
Yeah, I've been there my friend.
Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.
I shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right?
Great! Okay, here.
'Kay!
Why can't I tell them that we live together?
Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?
Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
Yeah I just... wanted to call and say hey.
I like it in the stern. ...of the boat. Hello.
No way!
Well, if I was wearing your underwear then, uh, what would you be wearing?. . . You're swell.
And?
Hey.
At this?!
Hey, I didn't make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500. Don't get to excited because that's not gonna happen unless you get-No way!
It's Clint! Clint!
Yes, include more people in this.
I'm sorry we, we don't have your sheep.
Maureen Rosilla.
Oh yes, somebody just said, "Can you hear anything?"
That's not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.
Uh Kathy, with K or a C?
Hey! So are you enjoying the bike?
Oh, and don't get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. It's just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it's making all the other guys jealous.
Yes, yes it is, short story, that I was writing.
Oh no no no, she's a total wack job. Yeah, she thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Remore.
Okay.
Yes!!
Oh that's great, my friend Joey's in the movie business.
Congratulations.
Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.
Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. Bye-bye. Oh God!
Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.
I know!
Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?
I walk into a room and he won't even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.
I don't know exactly.
Okay, I gotta go to work.
I'll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.
Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We have switched places! I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational screw up! And now we're back.
Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
Hey!
Oh the phone! The phone's making sounds! Hello!
What is it?
Well, we could count again.
Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did.
007?! This is James Bond's tux?!
Oh no-no-no, you-yeah, of course you get to be my best man.
No, we'd just like to close them.
All right, y'know what? Forget it, all of you forget it! You've ruined it! Go home! You've ruined it! You've ruined it!
Wow! That ripped! That ripped real nice!
Bye bye.
I could die.
No, you kidding? The guy's a freak..
Well, I'm there too!
What?
Hey, will you grab me a cruller? Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!
Well, aren't we Mr. "The glass is half empty."
I'm still mad at you for not telling me.
Well, You could, but... probably just the one time.
Oh what is it honey, you need some tea? Some soup? Oh-ohhhh!
She's one of us now.
Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves.
Yes! Yes! I'm good! Are you good? Are you good? Is everything-are you-are you perrr-perfect?!
Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high.
Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
Hi, Joe.
Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.
Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in 20 minutes! Come on, Joe!
Alright, let's do this.
Oh, so you're divorced?
Your tax dollars?
See you later Mon.
You know...Oh My God.
Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.
Ah!
Hi! I'm back. Yeah, that sounds great. Okay. Well, we'll do it then. Okay, bye-bye.
Okay, I promise, I'll end it.
All right ladies, here's what we're gonna do. You are gonna take off my clothes. You two, go get the oils. And you just constantly scream at the top of your voice, "Chandler's the king! Chandler's the king!"
Okay!
It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.
Multiple, so many paper cuts.
Yeah, that'd be much worse than being 28, and still working here.
Because it's too delicious.
Because the kids need new shoes.
That was in the fourth grade. How could you still be upset about that?
Monica and I are engaged.
I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
You think I should?
All right!! Wait! Wait, there's no sidewalk! Yeah, I'm gonna die here.
All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I can't believe I missed it.
Well, I ended up telling her everything.
Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu.
Yes.
He's taking off her coat!
Hey.
It was a car backfire!
He will, Joe.
Yeah?
Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! The Blowfish!
Wow!
Whoa!
Hey, I can be smooth. Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it.
Fine, I'll give the suit back.
Ahh, I think it just moved. It's really poking me.
Hey guys, what are you doing?
If I help, we can find 'em faster!
Okay.
...and then it got canceled.
Okay.
You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?
I can do that, I've had 30 years of practice.
Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I don't care!
OK, Phoebs, your turn.
Tell me what?
Hey, come on, it's not your fault.
Hey!
It's 6:00.
Hey!
Can I sleep on your couch?
Oh, come on! It's not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually I'm pretty much just in there by myself.
Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.
Thank you, sir.
Umm, how's it going with you guys?
I'm sorry. I'm-I'm-I'm sorry that I said I was going to when I'm not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And this isn't Rachel's fault. It's me. I have serious, serious problems when it comes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy, mascara goop. And I'm really sorry, it's just that this is not, this isn't going to work out.
Oh! That's great, they haven't seen the place since I moved in!
Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!
See that'll stop when you pick up the phone.
Again I must go back to, how?
What?
Yeah.
Hi Joey's sisters!
What happened? I'm just eating candy.
Where is Emily?
What? What are you, what are you talking about?
Huh.
That was so lame.
Hey.
How about those three pointers?
Oh, that's cool. Then I'll just bring them both over.
All right. Look, I'm gonna go in here, and you don't buy me anything ever.
I got glasses!
How is that worse?!
Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please?
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?
I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And y'know Mon, you can be in charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around...
So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?
Yep! And! A beautiful woman agreed to go out with me. Joey wanted to ask her out, but uh, she picked me.
Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is.
No! That was a test! In a couple of hours I'm gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! And then after that, I'm gonna get so drunk, I'm gonna wanna call Janice
Maybe 'cause the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm. Look Eddie, isn't there something else you're supposed to be doing right now?
Oh my God.
Okay, let's play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently.
Whoa ho.
No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
Oh, yeah?
Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!
Okay!
It's like 'Night of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.'
Now wait a minute, I claimed you in the name of France four years ago.
Um, we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for something...
What?
Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!
But uh Ross, Ross is a great guy! I was roommates with him in college. Uh, funny story... You're roommate in college died didn't he?
Who sold a story to Archie Comics?!
Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?
So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!
No, did he hug you?!
I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.
So, when I woke up this morning, he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes.
Bye.
I can't believe we live here!
Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?
Yeah. Oh it's not warm yet, we still have time.
No, I'm alright, thanks.
Hi.
Dude that is so sad.
The guy was hammered, okay? There's no way, you look like Ross's mother.
Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Or...
It's a sock bunny.
Oh, I wish I'd know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.
No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!
Okay, you guys uh, you guys pick first
Okay.
Here in Chelsea.
What is with him?
Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didn't I?
Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this?
Yeah, alright.
So, you feel like a dad yet?
Hi...dad.
Hey, relax I just need more time. We're going to dinner tonight.
Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!
No, that's okay. Monica I thought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever gonna had to do. But when I saw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprises that come our way it's okay, because I will always love you. You are the person I was meant to spend the rest of my life with. You wanna know if I'm sure?
Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and I'm afraid even more sweating.
Eldad, sit down. Move over! Move over now!
Wow! You are way to young to have seen that!
Let them win one.
Hey! How'd the audition go?
We can't accept this.
You dove in front of Ross! Ross!
Welcome home man.
I'm sorry but, ow-owww-owww!
He has sex, and we get hit in our heads.
Kathy's with her parents, I have nothing to do, so tomorrow we are partying with Gandolf dude!
See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. Me.
I'll make something up! I'm good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman!
Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.
It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it!
Op, y'know what though, it's kind've a girlie briefcase.
'Kay.
With Roger? Not just with Roger?! Oh my God!
Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY.
She was working on Valentine's Day so we're celebrating it tonight.
Let me see this guy. W-H-Wow! Don't show this to Monica! And don't tell her about the W-H-Wow!
I'm the ruptured spleen.
Sure.
Oh, what's at 8:00?
You wanna hug it out?
You know, I think I might just.
Well, don't, don't think me immodest, but, me?
Buy it for ya, or win it for ya?
Okay, one...two...
What, what's what you mean?
You must stop!
Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?
Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people.
Okay.
No. I'm not letting you or anybody else see, ever.
...Come on! Why are we here?!
Okay.
Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life.
See? Here we go.
Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.
All right, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna get shot down. Any advice?
Oh. Y'know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn't because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me 'cause, you're really hot! Is that okay?
It's your mommy. It's your mommy.
It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.
And your friend Phoebe?
Noo!! I don't care! I'm not, I'm not gonna playing one-on-one strip poker with you for practice!
Santa? Really?
Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep.
I'm right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now there's no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means!
Yes it would. What do you say to $50?
Hey!
You know, this is actually good, because if we ever lose Ross, we have a spare.
Huh.
Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea.
I don't know.
Hey.
Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there.
Why? What happened to him?
What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!
Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.
Oh no! No! No! No!
Uh-oh.
Oh.
No.
Basically we just feel that he's...
OK, I guess this is gonna seem kinda bittersweet now, but... Joey, that's who.
Well then maybe you should take it.
See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the Law & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!
Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, "Who's the best of that?" They'd have to go to you.
Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds.
Hey!
Thank God!
Yeah, yeah! Me too!
Well... we-we do. You can only eat Tic Tacks in even numbers.
Hey, Janice.
So uh, what did this woman look like?
Okay, we have to talk. I'm just getting out of a very serious relationship...
Oh my God!
You couldn't have told me about this on the phone?
Who's that?
...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?
How do ya do.
Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to face-And by face I don't mean his lap. And by face, I don't mean my ass.
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh!
I mean, if it were me, I think I'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all.
Tuna or egg salad? Decide!
Yes!!
That guy's going home with a note!
All right...
Oh wow, I hope you don't take this the wrong way but, I know we had plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, I'm just kinda worried about what it might do to our friendship.
Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.
But come on, look at how cute and small this is! So I got it to give Monica so she'd know I was okay.
Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?
God that is good TV.
Hey, there he is! There he is!
No one was around to hear that?
Do you wanna?
We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone. We didn't think we could make it.
I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick!
Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?! No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowers-Think of the money we'll save!! We're not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our wedding be bigger please?
Oh, I got some thoughts on that.
Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.
It's like this, me, no jokes.
That's what they'll call us.
That sounds like my first bike. My dad gave me his old one.
Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!
Yeah, well, lucky for you.
No, no, I keep trying, y'know? I can get out, "Joey, I have too..." but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "...go to the bathroom." He may think I'm sick.
Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there....
Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card people.
Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
Fine.
What? What? Why?!
All right.
He took my joke, he took it.
Y'know I was thinking if we had a...a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours...
Gee, Monica, what's in the bag?
Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?
It's true.
What equity investments?
...Hm.
That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.
Okay man.
Is that Joey?! Let me talk to him!
What?!
Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard you'd be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!
Oop!
Ahh-hahaha!
Look, I'm telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which is when I started smoking in the first place.
We didn't get to the audition. I'm gonna take her to coffee and then we'll do it then.
Yes! I'm fine. In fact I've been fine for a long time now and I think, the reason is you.
Okay, you give the worst massages in the world.
Doesn't know, "Hello." But she knows Capricorn One.
I can't believe she can out run you man!
Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that's what we're gonna do.
Really? Worse than, "More turkey Mr. Chandler?"
What is it?
Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
Yeah, okay.
Okay, are you aware unagi is an eel?
They don't really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can get you some free white out though.
Can you hold on a moment? I have another call. I love her.
Totally crazy stupid.
Ooh, you almost had it.
Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding...
Do we dare?
Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?
Thanks.
Uh, no Pheebs. What's it look like?
Excuse me...
What if Joey were president?
Yeah.
Expect it in 4-6 weeks. Umm, hey, umm, Joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves.
Our next cocktail party?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!
Nooo!! She's really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!
Okay... ..whose turn is it?
Does this mean we're gonna have to start paying for coffee?
Hey, listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if I would've known you guys were... I never would've...
No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who's going like this...
Oh yeah, there-there she is!
What?
Phoebe is, making people.
Yeah, I know what you're thinkin'! Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.
That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up.
Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!
Maybe that's because soy-burgers suck!
What is the matter with you?
Okay man.
"Smoke away."
It's a buffet man.
Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we've got reservations at Ja George.
It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.
Yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month, they give you 2% financing.
...spender.
Ow!
Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.
Hey, hey, those guys are takin our stuff!
Your last roommate's kidney?
No, it's not like, like Phil Spiderman. He's a spider, man. Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but there's no Gold Man.
Yes, I am!
Okay, so Richard, Richard!
He has a gun!
Those are book ends! That's a great gift!
Come on Chloe! Finish up with your customer first. Come on Chloe! Come on Chloe!!
You're kidding.
I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. So please wake up so we can do it right!
Just tell her the truth! Tell her you're not ready.
Oh my God!
I got caught up and work, but I'm quitting tomorrow.
Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.
Okay, I don't think we can turn anymore!
Don't worry about it Pheebs.
Yes indeedy! With a beautiful view of...
She was not good. Not good.
Well I was! Then I went down to the gift shop because I was out of cigarettes...
Oh, good. Rog is here.
All right, then massage me up right nice!
No-no! This is my fiancee and her heart was set on that ring. You don't want to break her heart now do you?
See that is the problem with invisible dentists.
Okay.
I can't remember which sister.
Well, that is what happened, and I don't even see you denying this!
Oh, that's mature.
So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?
That's a hernia.
Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?
This is great! Helen, could you come in here for a moment?
Congratulations.
But those are the words! Those exact words!
Oh my God.
You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...
Hey, Rach, can I get...
OK, I'm officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me man. Joe? Well, I guess Joey went home. Oh and look, there's still one box that I have to unpack.
Oh.
What, like a number?
So, you don't think I'm terminal?
What?! Ow!
Yeah o-okay, but I'm just doing this for you.
Alright, here's ten.
Yeah, but uh, it was 1982 and my flock of seagulls haircut was tickling her chin.
God, I love these fingers...
Oh my God, I can't believe this! Y'know, I thought...I thought you were a good guy.
Now this feels like Thanksgiving.
Ah, well, maybe thats, ah, because youre getting a big raise.
Oh. Nope, that patch is no good.
Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. Chan and Jan Forever.
How do you figure that?
And that doesn't scare you?
Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?
Okay!
Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done! And you said it was gonna be fun! Which it kinda is. Also, you said there would be other guys here. There are no other guys here!
Arghhhhhh!!
No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we're up at the altar and I'm like this.
Nope! Because I'm not your boyfriend. Hey Pheebs, how did it go?
You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different.
Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you're my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again.
Oooh, I'm afraid that does not exist.
I was being Shelly Winters from The Poseidon Adventure.
Oh, she's got you running errands, y'know, picking up wedding dresses... Wah-pah!
I love you.
Joey? Got you a Joey Special, two pizzas! Joe? Hello? Damnit! Hello? No, Joey's not here right now, but I can take a message I think. He's still got a chance for the part?! Oh, that's great news! Well no obviously not for the actor who was mauled by his dog. Oh well, that's great. I will give Joey the message. Thank you! Yes! Okay, Mac audition at 2:00. Allergy actor attacked. By dog not flowers.
Right on! Oh! Uh, but, don't take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez.
Are you eating the cheesecake without me?!
That's a bad duck!!! How'd the thing go tonight, Ross?
No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractive... Hold on one second; let me check this out. (He gets up and grabs a photo album.
Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him.
No-no, I don't think you heard me. Are you ready to party?!
Yeah, this is so good, that I'm gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.
Oh, Richard. That's all I ever hear, Richard, Richard, Richard!
No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?
No-no
I wanna quit the gym.
Two!
I don't know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. She's saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to Dollywood.
Yeah, but I'm, I'm so much faster...
Oh yeah, you got the big TV. We'll be over there all the time. . . except when we are here.
Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!
Well, now, I actually have to get to work.
Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her....
Yeah. O-okay.
What?
Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me. So I got you some gifts that I found on the side of the road. Who wants the teddy bear with one leg?
Y'know it's funny I started it but, now it's scary me. So could you come out here please?
No.
Who did you originally want to hook up with?
Four different women! I've had sex way more times!
I'll go.
Y'know, it'll be okay. It'll be okay. Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then we'll tell 'em.
Yeah, I mean we're gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair.
Batman has Robin! We get ESPN right?
Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid's pretzel at them.
Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...
I don't think that's what they were talking about Joe!!
Hey!
Well, come on, I've been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.
Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer.
No, I just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them. Hello sweet pants!
So, Spock actually hugs his father?
Okay, that's like the least fun game ever.
...Poulet passes it up to Leetch!
Am I naked again?!
Hey, man. What's up?
Oh nothing, we're just talking. Y'know, blah-blah-blah.
You know, I mean, you can't tell your parents you were fired because they'd be disappointed.
What, what are you laughing at?
Yeah okay. Well, what's the next little bit?
Wow! Look at them run.
And I'm blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it, "Oh Chandler, I just lost myself in the moment."
Hey!
So you didn't mean any of that?!
Hi, how are ya?
Hi there!
What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?
What?
Well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend and her brother, I can't do that we promised we'd make each other gifts this year.
Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor? Yeah, I miss you too. Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know? Well, that's very generous er, but look, this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I can really care about.... And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier? Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is not a negotiation, this is a rejection! No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy! I'll see you on Monday!
How is that ever going to happen?!
Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.
Boys? We're going in.
In a foreign, romantic country...
Couldn't be more out.
I'm still on London time, does that count?
OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down.
Okay I promise. I'll-I'll hate it. Wow! You-you look...hideous.
...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'
So, uhh, em, you want me to uh, give you a hand with the foosball table?
Monica?
It means we're holding hands.
Cupping.
I'll catch you guys later.
We came over as soon as we saw.
That thing, it's a uhh. . . yeah it's, it's a little flashy.
What did you just do?
So, whaddya say boys, should I call him? Well, ya know what they say. Ask your slippers a question... you're going crazy.
Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!
Okay, I'll stop.
It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
Okay. Joey, trade lives with me!
And then Joey remembered something.
Oh, she's sorry! I feel better!
If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!
Hey!
That is amazing.
No, I am.
Howdy.
I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the "new thing you do that day!" And it starts right now!
Ahh, come on! Y'know what-y'know what, I think I'm just gonna go home and call Kathy.
Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here?
Hey Monica, here's your broom back.
Okay, but now see you're crying!
All right!
Yep, I'm in a tree.
Is that supposed to be funny! I was really worried over here!
Oh that's great! Right there! Can we get some of that over here please? There we go.
You'll get one.
The meaning of the box is three fold. One , it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two , it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three , it hurts!
Okay! Oh man! Don't tell me I did this!
Hey Ross.... bahhhh!
Uhh, that was Joey. He's running a little late, he says he's sorry.
Y'know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?
No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody.
I say we go with Careless Whisper.
Hello.
Why do they put so much steam in there?!
Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.
Okay!
Oh, that's Parent's Day, first grade. That's me with the janitor Martin.
Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.
I am pretending.
Because it's flattering! Come on Monica! Come on Monica!
Well, does that mean that you're not going to wearing yours?
Oh good, okay, I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore. So you win, okay? Here! Pheebs? Flying a jet? Better make it a spaceship so that you can get back to your home planet! And Ross, phone call for you today, Tom Jones, he wants his pants back! And Hornswoggle? What are you dating a character from Fraggile Rock?!
Oh, hey.
You wanna play?
Yeah baby!
Hey!
Where I don't want to have a relationship ever! I just want to have sex with strippers and my friends!!
Yeah, get out!
99...100! Ready or not, here I come! All right, let's go over the concept one more time.
Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?
Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?
Okay.
Oh no-no, I can't do that.
Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a party.
Okay.
Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go.
Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?
No, no, no, I don't, I don't really wanna play.
No, you're the best.
It's possible. You are very loveable, I'd miss you if I broke up with you. I was just trying to be supportive.
What time is it now?
But I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
Hey!
Yeah, o-okay.
Kill me. Kill me now.
Oh my God!
Phoebe.
Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?
I don't know. I just had this weird sense. You know, but that's me. I'm weird and sensitive. Tissue?
That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!
Look, it's my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you.
Fine with me.
Okay before we start the celebration, Monica has to go put on her party dress.
Alright, so what's it about?
Ahhh.
I feel violated. And not in a good way.
Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight.
Okay. You were right. I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.
Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.
So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?
I think it's great. It's great. Y'know, they're thinking of changing the name of this place.
Oh great, food with hair on it.
She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it.
Hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. That is very dad.
Okay, now when you come back I hope you remember that, that chick is not a toy!
I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . Hi!
Hey, this isn't like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!
She was kidding.
So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law & Order?
Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I'll be sure to give him your shoe.
So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class.
Yeah?
Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there's nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening.
Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?
Take off your shirt!
You can't tell, but I'm trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!
Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! And you are about to marry a wonderful man! Hey! I'm marrying a dead woman!
I called you fat?! I don't even remember that!
Richard was there so I couldn't do it!
Yes talk to her. Be a man.
Yeah?
Yeah, okay.
Here we go.
Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?
I see where you're goin'!
Hi.
And no one touches the air around the TV!
Hi.
You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, "You are you wearing?! You look fabulous!"
If you get this one, we buy everybody here a steak dinner!
Oh yeah, that's very nice. Plus, y'know they were free and they're too small.
Yeah. Right.
And I just want a million dollars!
Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no.
I'm only going to pretend I'm moving to Yemen, it's the only way I can get rid off her.
Whoa-whoa-whoa! What?
This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins.
Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?
We don't need to remedy that.
Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go.
Actually, this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of her favorite book.
Well she, she wouldn't do that, she's with, she's with me.
Thank you! All right, I gotta go unpack.
Oh that's great! Good for you.
Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?
Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?
Open up! Open up! Open up!
Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!
Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please.
Should I tell her I ordered tea?
You think?
Really.
What are you smiling about? What is so funny?
Hey Gar!
I know! I know!
Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.
I got a good one, I got a good one! I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.
And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.
You're right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him. Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on.
He paints quite a picture doesn't he?
Okay. You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!
Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there?
Oh, okay. Here you go.
What?!
Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?
That's me! Come on!
So, Joey on Law & Order, you must be very proud!
All right!
I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
That's good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths.
Because you broke a chair and you broke a chair! The only one around here that hasn't broke a chair, is me!
Phoebe Buffay In Buffay The Vampire Layer.
Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?
Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that's great! Y'know so you can cook while in the tub.
Chandler.
All right, I have to get that, but no-no. Hello? Hi! Yeah listen, I'm, I'm in need of a stripper and I was told that you do that. Let me ask you this, what, what do you do for the extra hundred? So would I, would I have to provide the grapes?
Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?
No! Look, I don't cry! It's not a big deal! Okay?!
It's a big company, I don't-if you-I...
Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad co-captain only took up so much room.
Okay, fine, $300.
It's Clint. It's Clint!
Hey-hey are you drunk?
Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!
You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!
Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare.
Are you serious?
Hey.
Tomorrow night is good. Tomorrow night is good, but uh, y'know what? Why put off something till tomorrow that you can do right now? Eldad come here!
Oh no.
Well, you can understand, given how we started.
So do you think uh, Joey's more charming than me?
Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname?
Mazel tov!
What-what Richard thing?
Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.
Really? Okay, so...
Refill?
Didn't you used to call it the Little Major?
Still broken?
That's not specific to girls.
You okay there man?
Hey.
Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with a woman, y'know, I know where everything goes, it's always nice. But I need to know what makes it go from nice to, "My God! Somebody's killing her in there!"
Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?
Yes, we were just...
Oh, good! Good! Do you guys know how to get a chick out of a VCR?!
Hey!
No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud.
Well the vet seems to think that's she's becoming a rooster. We're getting a second opinion.
Alright.
Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so...
Okay! Okay! Okay! Oh God, I thought... Wait a minute, I-I can do this. I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. And if you'll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. Monica, will you marry me?
You hear that? We're the guys.
All right.
Well she's, she's the kinda girl-Joey was unconscious.
Okay.
All right, look, you're not really gonna buy that are you? Don't you think you've embarrassed me enough for one day?
Y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas.
Nah, Nah, it's okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know, do kind of like a man thing.
Hi.
What are you doing out there?
Oh look, it's the woman we ordered.
I gotta check out this hot girl! There she is!
No thank you.
Always illegal Joe.
Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.
What are you guys doing?
Yes because uh, you look so young.
Yes, yes I am. Err, listen, the reason that I called you in here today was, err... please dont hate me.
Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and don't talk to anyone.
What if I had had the guts to quit my job? I'd probably be writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny. But my job's fun too! I mean tomorrow, I-I don't have to wear a tie.
Yeah you can do it.
Oh my God! Someone's killed Square Man!
Yeah, it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just doesn't say 'cool' anymore.
Ho-oh, he's gonna get some! Of the glare from the streetlight out of his apartment. Y'know so umm, he's closed the drapes there so he can have a nice, pleasant conversation with your little sister. Well, I'm off to bed!
I know.
Oh, good, Joey's home now.
That's okay Pheebs, we're not having a party or anything, so you don't have to get us...
Yeah, I'm cool. Casual.
Okay. I'll be right there.
No reason, except...she...told...me.
Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the Year?
I can't believe we're doing this.
Very informative!
Oh yeah, that looks good.
What?
All right, should we just, should we just get married? Y'know? I mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it.
I don't want to look.
Y'know, sometimes that fake out thing is just mean!
Oh, it doesn't matter. Hey, y'know what, I've got two tickets to tonight's Rangers game, you wanna come with me?
Okay, great.
Hey!
Listen can you guys uh, speak up, it's harder for us to hear you when you lower your voice.
Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.
All right, let's show them how it's done.
No, there were two.
Hi Monica.
You're right, I know.
Ah, sure, Nina. Whats up?
We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!
Eh, somebody's in a good mood!
No! Ahhh!!!
Without my toe?! I need my toe!
It is the softest hair! Touch it!
Oh great!
Hi.
Well I was... I was exactly expecting company after... 9:15.
Okay, it's not a check. They're saying your health insurance expired because, you didn't work enough last year.
See that's where I think that you're wrong. We've been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.
Is anybody else scared?
It's the theme from Good Will Humping.
Well it's very unsettling.
Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.
Sure you do.
No, I'm not mocking you, or you beautiful guest room.
If I broke up with you, I'd miss you.
The one that doesn't.
All right. I thought about it and maybe you're right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.
Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?
The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so...
Oh, now? No, no, I think something this nice should be saved for a special occasion.
Or what my Father called Thursday night.
Fine with me.
Yes! See you and I have always been like-
Bye!
Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was funny, just not "Archie Comic funny."
Yeah. Yes! Yeah.
Do you happen to know what I'm going to say?
You know, you think I would.
Ok, well, this was very special.
That's a good plan, Joe. Next time we wanna pick up women, we should just go to the park and make out. Taxi, taxi!
Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?
Because that's the only part of you he can see when he's on the table!
Oh no-no-no-no!
Princess Leia in the gold bikini.
Oh yeah, I just showed this a picture of you and guys were throwing themselves at me! They're buying me drinks! They're giving me stuff! Knicks tonight?
Would you put that back on?! Monica's gonna be here any minute!
So what'd you do?
Okay, well tonight's the big night.
Hey, I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and Emily, and I think that's, I think that's really cool.
Oh.
So what does this mean?
She is now.
Ohh, yeah.
Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.
That's it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?
Oh! Look at that, time's up! My turn!
No, but wait-what if I bought it from you, y'know? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say $1,500?
All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
That's a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.
I can't believe I ruined this.
Ow!
Well Monica just told me that they don't.
Why wouldn't they be happy?
Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn? "You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."
But, we'll stay here with you.
Where did you, when did you, how did you... How did you get a girl like that?
Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you're gonna go?
Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey, do you know a six-letter word for red?
Good night.
Hey!
You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!
This is nuts. This is crazy. She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish tank, and left, end of story.
My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt.
I am proud of all my friends today.
Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let's take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs don't mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that's just an ordinary pig not even a pig that's good at sports!
I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!
Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?
Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.
That's still in there?!
But it's Ross.
Well, I guess that's something.
So, basically just a Chinese guy.
We have to leave for New York in an hour.
I tell people secrets. It makes them like me.
Yeah, it's a very large plane.
It could've been worse, he could've shot her.
Yeah, I'm not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.
I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?
Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
Do you know what I was thinkin'?
Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.
Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay.
Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!
Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.
Well, I've got a girl in here.
What?
That was Joey!
What are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes?
Hey so, did uh, did she move out?
Hey Pheebs!
I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she didn't ask me to go do it with her in the vault.
Oh, Satan's minions at work again...
You-you do?
No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.
That was so unlikely. Well, let's get married! I guess.
So what does this mean?
All right, there's a nuclear holocaust, I'm the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
See Joe, not that that's not grrreat! But, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! Y'know, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!
Oh, ok.
Yeah, but I bet it works.
Stop what?!
Yeah, I think we should see other people.
Our new fridge? I don't live here anymore.
Ha-ha-ha--enh-enh. I'm so glad you guys are all here! My office finally got wrinkle free fax paper!
So this is nice! I wish I didn't have to go, believe me! But unfortunately I have to. Oh uh, by the way, what's the name the girl you're dating?
Call me!
Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?
I, I know.
Hey!
Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!
What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
Hey-hey, hey! I don't know why I did that!
Here we go! Here we go!
This is unbelievable. Its been like a half an hour. If this was a cartoon, youd be looking like a ham right about now.
We're flipping Monica's mattress.
Dude, you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up.
Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.
Okaaay, rock, hard place, me.
No, we're still together. Yeah we went out for two summers, and then I broke up with her.
Whoa-whoa-whoa!
Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever.
Okay.
What are you doing?
Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me?
So, you uh, you think that Speed Racer guy gets a lot of tickets er?
Me.
Hey!
Yeah, he's really excited about it too, he even recorded show times on his answering machine.
Ahhhhh!
Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's.
Okay, for the last time. It's not named for each individual man.
When you're marrying us; that's what you should say.
You-you-you don't wanna give into the fear.
You're naked in this picture!
I don't think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in. Draw!!
That's a low one!
Joey, it's been three days, okay.. Your just a little homesick, Okay. Would you just try to relax. Just, just try to enjoy yourself.
What?!
He is?
Eh?
Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.
I wish I had smoked for my career...
Oh, I have to get married in James Bond's tux!
Okay, everybody stay here. I will find out what's going on.
Wow that's actually pretty cool.
Yeah, let's just forget it.
It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon! She's-she's gonna kill me.
Can I be that guy?
Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!
Did he just say, he loves Fonzie?
Hey, I've been honing!
Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite! It's no big deal.
So uh, which one is mine?
You mean they like you.
What's this?
Yeah all right, so we'll hang out.
Okay, now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be a surprise and she's gonna know.
Really? Right across the street?
Oh, you know, I would, but that might get in the way of my lying around time.
So um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?
Hi.
Okay!
What?
Great. It was great. She's ah, she's great, great looking, great personality, she's greatness.
Yeah?
It still doesn't work.
Oh yes! Oh yes!
Yeah.
Oh! Good for you Pheebs, way to go!
Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? : "When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy!"
We think he was trying to spell out 'MONKEY.'
Isn't that Ross's money?
How long have we been home?
Well, hello!
Air hole! Air hole!!
It's a kitchen slash bathroom.
Tickets please! That's courtside baby!
I told you I should not wear this color.
Hey! Oh, good, Ross! You're parents like me, right?
Well, it'll probably slow it down at first but, once I get used to the extra weight, I'll be back on track.
Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!!
God?
Look forget it okay? I don't want to go. I don't want to see him. I don't wanna.
Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?
Oh, y'know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.
Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.
The sheep.
What did you do?
Hey!
Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.
I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream now, right?
All right! Isn't this a woman's hat?
Why would I be mad?
Peter Parker.
Well, look it's been a really emotional time y'know, and you've had a lot to drink. And you've just got to let that go okay? I mean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight!
She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
What?! Why did you do that?
Well, there you go.
There's gonna be a wedding. You're gonna be the bride. Two hundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress.
Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!
Have you seen Joey?
Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!
Oh, hi! Excuse me, is uh Rachel Green here? I was supposed to meet her for lunch.
Hey.
Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean.
Hey!
Hey!
Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here?
To Put the Camera Away!!!
Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
Alright I'll tell you what, I'll play you for it.
No!
Okay, that hurt us.
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.
No, no, you got zero points for 'IDNEY'.
I'm gonna say this for the last time. Would you please just...
Actually, it's Miss Chinandolor Bong.
Here you go Phoebe! Here you go Phobo! Phewbedo! Phaybobo.
Okay!
Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something.
I don't know what it is, I just can't take a good picture.
Hey, this is so unfair!
Okay. But if you don't come back soon, there's pretty much nothing I can do about it!
Nice shooting!
Oh-oh, what are you doing?
You, you are gonna love this.
No!
It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert...Look talk to Monica, she's on the food committee.
Hey!
Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy , uh but he doesn't want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assist-as his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that can't have lumps in them.
I know about Monica.
You have to really wanna see it.
Help!
Okay. You won't believe what Monica's older brother just said to me!
...He's in.
So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?
Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her? No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!
Oh my God!
Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?
Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year.
Hey, Pheebs!
So ah, whatcha watching?
Okay!
Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image?
Well, I think you should seriously consider the marriage thing, give Rachel another chance to dress up like Princess Bubble Yum.
I didn't know that.
Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.
No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.
Yeah!
Well, I, I should go in there.
Thank you.
Hey-hey-hey Rachel, funny thing. Actually, the ah, end zone starts at that pole, so you're five feet short, so we win!
I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother. I've done it again.
Is that your new walk?
Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
You mean with Casey.
No-no-Really?!
Well, how could anyone not be in love with Yasmine Blepe?
Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place.
Well, you want me to uh, clench anything, or-... Susie? Susie.
I'm not gonna mess it up.
Hey.
The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.
What does it say?!
Heads it is.
Plus, you look cool.
Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.
Hey Joe!
Okay.
Yeah, all right, I'll play.
Mustached bastard...
Hey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon.
Excuse me. How ya doin'?
Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves.
Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who's boss.
Right in there!
To pay for the gym.
You didn't think I used to wear glasses, right?
Hey!
Nngghhh!!!!!!!
Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000.
Oh, I would never bet this apartment. It's too nice.
But I love swing music!
Okay! Okay! Okay! I'll do it! Oh God, I thought... Wait a minute, I-I can do this. I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. And if you'll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. Monica, will you marry me?
That's right my friend. It's time for...
This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.
Oh well, not as lovely as you. I mean, I can't believe that you would have a thirty-year-old daughter! And you! I can't believe that you would have a tux that's thirty years old!
Who's number two? One of the more difficult games sewer workers play.
Eh, they're both good. I generally just go with, Monica's drunk again.
No he didn't.
Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica.
Thank you Helen, that'll be all.
Cupping.
Oh, that's The Wedding March. Does, does that freak you out?
The man's got a point.
But if we win, we get your apartment.
I paid for those tickets!
Yeah, I understand.
Joey, can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah? I hope you're not thinking about cleaning the living room.
OK.
Yeah, right here in my pocket. Pheebs?
Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut...
What're you kidding? I broke up with her. She actually thought that Sean Penn was the capital of Cambodia.
What is the thing?
Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap
Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true.
No, no, no!
Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!
You got it. You got Nevada twice.
It's a great idea.
Bit country? C'mon in here you roomie.
It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent it to us.
Well, I don't have to buy that, "I'm with stupid" T-shirt anymore.
Yes. She was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me. Janice is my last chance to have somebody.
Joey told me, he saw you two kissing.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact.
Is that your tiny little box, that's too small to put anything in?
So, are you guys in the movie, or are you just really paranoid.
Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!
Oh, will you give me the thing.
Wow, you look...
You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.
All right.
Well, how do you find clothes that fit?
The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!
Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
You totally screwed him over.
Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice.
Oh, no-no-no-no-no....
Look you have to help me out here. I thought we had a deal. I thought by the time...
Oh! Worm medicine for the duck.
Yeah, I'll sit down.
Oh, yeah, sure, it's not mine anyway. It can with the pants.
Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could get arrested.
I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?
Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.
Okay, uh, how about, how about-y'know what? We could play a new game. A new game, it's fun.
Whoa, she's pretty.
Cups.
I didn't know you had another level.
Great!! That's great!
And this- is my reward!
Oh yeah! With who?
Yes, and I was saying the actual words.
Yup, get ready for the gelatenous fun.
For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.
All right! Fine! But it's just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I don't want you setting me up with anybody ever again!
Well what's the difference? Your eggs aren't here anymore, are they? You took your eggs and you left. You really expect me to never find new eggs?
What?
We can't do that that's insane. I mean 'A' he could wake up and 'B' y'know, let's go for it.
Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend. This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?
Are you hugging the door right now.
Oh yeah, that sounds great. Oh, and listen, it's, it's gonna be....
Oh, you do? Because she said you guys havent talked in like years.
No-no, I mean what, what's this about your new place?
Come on! Gary's such a great guy! Whatever the problem is, you can work it out!
Yes. Okay, there's this one guy, Patrick, I think you're gonna like him, he's really nice, he's funny, he's a swimmer.
Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?
Y'know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs...
Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?
Yeah, just leave me alone for a while.
Hey Phoebe!
Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn.
Alright. Yes, this is Rachel.
Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.
Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!
Hey!
Now you do that, you're on TV.
You bet I did, Ben, put it there! Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small! Ho, ho, ho!
Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? I mean y'know you can't date him right?
So I really never get to win anymore?
You built a fort didn't ya?
Yes!
Okay, I'm not gonna have one.
Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet. And he was in the scale modeler's club, and I was, well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool.
'Cause I was sitting there.
As crazy as soccer?
You just, you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body!
We still have porn.
Hey, y'know what? I was wrong.
I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesn't matter, I still wind up with this little cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. It's so annoying. Does it bug you?
Shall I carve?
Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?
...little playthings with yarn?
Wow, this is serious. Ive never known you to pay money for any kind of capade.
Math!! You're giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forget about it, you go for the girl, we'll see who gets her.
And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.
That's me.
And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight. You were also going to buy Monica flowers but you couldn't afford it, because you paid dinner last night.
Look guys, I know it's a little steep.
I'm afraid I might just be.
OH MY GOD!!!
Yeah.
Feelings, such strong feelings.
You didn't bring me here to do that, did you?
Chelsea.
YEAH!!! YES!!!
Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...
Oh yeah? Joshua, give me a call sometime, guys like you never go out of style-what did you throw away?
Okay. What was tonight?
Condoms, dude!
Next time?
Ben! Ben! Ben!
You're right, and I'm sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I won't say another word tonight.
This is so bad. If-if you're not Mary-Angela, then-then who is?
Hm-hmm.
Because that's where Joey gave me some stuff to store that I've never seen before in my life! Okay, that did not just happen!
Is that a real thing?
Knit, good woman, knit, knit!
Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.
I'm not macho.
Too?
Ross came in forth and cried!
Ohh, she's pretty. Pretty ahh, pretty girl, the pretty--she's pretty.
Well, Ross and Emily aren't gonna use it.
That's the way I did it 'til I was 19.
Okay. Listen-listen, we're not gonna have to walk this way the entire time are we?
So what happened?
Marcel?!
OK.
It's Thursday! How was the audition?!
You're a little high maintenance.
Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?
Okay, okay, you got it!
Ok, you can have it.
Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.
And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?
So, why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of homework to do?
Off?!!
Uhh, no.
It's not charity, Joe...
Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream.
Bedroom. Bathroom. Living room. This right here is the kitchen, and thanks for coming by, Bye-bye.
That's what you say at the end of a date.
All right!!
Again?
It happened in London.
All right!
Go change! She doesn't want her parents to know she's drunk.
Hi.
Hello. It's Gandolf!!! So, are you in town? Oh, well, well maybe next time then.
As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I'm going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.
I do NOT want this unit!!
Relax your hand!
Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? What're you lookin' at me for? He's the one who wants to boff the maniac.
Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica that's as good as garbage?
So will I.
Well, this is much better.
Look, I'm not saying that you should magically forgive me! But you're not perfect! You've made some errors in judgment too!
That.
Oh, come on! I don't care! Come on! Whose is it?
So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve's doctor's name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, 'Doctor Monkey?' And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up.
This teramisu is, is excellent. Did you make it Mary-Angela?
You said no right?!
You didn't just break up.
Guys guys, check this out.
When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.
Ok.
Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards.
Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby.
Sure, why not?
I hear ya, Mugsy! But look, all these rooms are fine okay? Can you just pick one so I can watch--have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.
Yes!!!
Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number.
More so than anything else.
Why?! I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this.
Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!
...Dinah?
All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him!
Ohh, she's-she's not really my type.
Okay.
Sure. And listen, thanks for doing that for us, by the way.
Oooo-ooh!
Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats!
An old cookie?
Isn't she cute? No!
What are you talking about?
Yeah, yeah, she works over at that place, uh...
No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married."
What does she do?
Yes, if it really doesn't mean anything, because you know that I'm just not ready...
He's Greek Orthodox.
Get out. Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.
Oh yeah man. Joey.
Well, 'cause she came back the third summer and she'd gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow...
Phoebe knows about us!
Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape.
Prague?
There you go.
Okay!
Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.
Wow, I don't know what to say. Wow, I, I don't know what to say.
So what was it for anyway?
Oh my God, how did you do that?
Listen, I'm really glad you got the part.
When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!
Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.
Thank you, buddy.
Orange juice.
I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.
That was pretty 007.
I'm up! I'm up, I've gotten up now! Anybody ah, want anything?
How many times have I told you guys, you never watch the cooking channel!
This is not out of the blue, this is smack dab in the middle of the blue.
Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me!
Oh wow, I hope you don't take this the wrong way but, I know we had plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, I'm just kinda worried about what it might do to our friendship.
How do you feel about the, "I really did forgot the present, please forgive me" not fake out?
Hi! I'm Dorf! You're date for the evening. Oh come on! Dorf on dating, that's good stuff!!
Did she freak out?
Tonight, on a very special Blossom.
Yeah, I know, I did that two minutes ago.
Uh, uh.
You are beautiful.
You're not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.
Freedom!
Hello, Janice.
Hey, how 'bout it? You, me, Saturday night?
Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? I'm going to go over to Joey's.
What are you talking...
Phoebe!
Guys, guys, guess who I am?!
It's a nickname, I'll explain later.
Hmmm, that's very cool.
Ross, a sports car? Wouldn't it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?
What?! I'm Chandler! Oh, that's Richard!
Monica, I think you've gone over to the bad place.
Guys! Guys! Come on! It's Thanksgiving, it's not important who wins or loses. The important thing is, the Dutch girl picked me! Me! Not you! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!!
No, no I just ah, didn't do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don't deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.
Having a swim.
Oh, by the way, that is her full name.
Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here.
Thank you, Ross.
Big dog?
Oh yea, your right. It's the second one.
Okay!
Wait a minute! I have a date tomorrow night.
She?
She's shhing me! It's my phone and she's shhing me!
You look beautiful mom. You look beautiful too dad. I love you both. I'm so glad you here.
Are you sure you weren't looking at your hands in a mirror?
What about the birds?
Defend yourself.
Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?
And! They like me more just because I was with ya! I think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey. And Doug wants us to play tennis with them. He's never even talked to me outside of work. Except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club. Strip church. Anyway, I'm gonna go try and find a racquet.
No, Janice.
You know, I once dated a Miss Crankypants. Lovely girl, kinda moody.
Well, that's the best kiss I've had with anyone I've ever met in a men's room.
At least let me smoke it to the good part.
Well, I have a girlfriend, I'm-I'm happy. So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.
Might wanna open with the snowman.
It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner.
Ooh! Yes! Okay! Here's what we do, we-we forget it happened.
Okay and he hasn't proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.
No. No, not at all, that's-that's ridiculous.
Before you say anything, have we got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner!
Oh, she's goin' somewhere.
Y'know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren't they?
OK, but uh, I hope you realize this means we're gonna miss hearing about the specials.
Oh, it's awkward. It's awkward. It's awkward.
You have to give 'em something, you know. Okay, now that was Gerston, Santos, and who's the guy with the moustache?
Actually, uh, we're both the father.
What?
Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go.
Oh-no, y'know with Gandolf we'd be out all night!
You had to ask.
I don't believe it. The most romantic night of my life and I'm runner up.
No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice.
Really? Wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.
Okay, who wore those?
Oh my God!!
Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!
Yeah!
Cool, girl roommate.
Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!
That's one?
Could you want her more?
So--You got in voluntarily?!
What gay thing?
Oh. Oh right! Right! Because you're still seeing him and uh, he's a good guy. I mean, I remember a time when...
Okay uh, here's the electric bill.
That was an obvious joke, and I didn't think of it. Why didn't I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done!
Why to save your dignity my man.
Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.
Does South Oregon have a sports-team? There you go.
It came up.
Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldn't have, but it did. I mean I like her, I don't want to stop seeing her, but every so often it's like 'Hey, y'know what, where's your leg?' I mean I'm the smallest person in the world aren't I? I'm the smallest person in the world.
Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?
Okay, well it this bed isn't new, how come there is plastic on the mattress?
Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?
Yeah! If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me, y'know? Because you've been waiting a very long time and I wouldn't want to disappoint you.
Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment.
I don't want to say.
We got some Vap-O-Rub in some places.
Centerpieces!
Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?
Y'know, I can't believe Kathy did this too me. I really, thought that she was the one. I tell you what, from now on I'm never getting out of this chair, ever! Okay? From now on, this chair is the one! You wanna what else is the one? My sweat pants!
Airplane! Airport! Airport '75! Airport '77! Airport '79!
Yes!
Hey! Wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look like a drum.
I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped.
So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!
Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay.
Forget it, that's off.
Um-mm, yeah right!
Well they were chair-shaped cows. They never would have survived in the wild.
Joey!
Hey!
Ohhh. Don't go.
Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.
Do you want me to call?
Ground control to Major Tom! Commencing countdown...engines...on!
Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.
Oh hi!
Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?
Hey man, how did the audition go?
Oh that's right. It's your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?
Who are you going out with?
Oh my God!! Is everybody getting married?!!
Okay, we owe you a present.
Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! I'll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!
Oh, don't thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work.
Oh, is that against the rules?
Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.
What's going on?
Okay, okay, but don't worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I'm fairly certain are the same thing.
Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back.
Okay, here's the thing. We're gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that you're drunk.
Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats.
All right, now look at her and tell me she doesnt look exactly like her sister.
So, uh... what do you think it is about me?
Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?
Ya know Phoebs, don't feel so bad for 'em. After they're done playing, I break out the little plastic women and everybody has a pretty good time.
Totally worth it!
During this time...are you, are you still my best man?
What?
Okay.
Lick away my man.
Man, I gotta get a kid.
You know what's weird. Donald Duck never wore pants. But whenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. I mean, what is that about?
And I will cook anything you want in here , and do anything in there!
You did look like an idiot.
I'm fine.
You'll get one.
Eh, y'know what, she's to political, she probably wouldn't let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.
Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!
I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?
Hey.
Hi!
Oh, I see. I thought you just really, really liked your new couch.
I got something for her. It's a book!
Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh...
Yeah, all right.
Hey, you feelin' better?
Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?
C'mon, we're great together, why not?
H-He's in China!
Hello! One marriage please!
And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty seven dollars. No strings attached. Now, if you can't remember that, I think we should write it down-let's write it down!
Oh come on!!
Yeah, she, she brought the invisible cab. . . hop in.
I don't know... um, Grease?
Oh uh, o, OK.
I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!
Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that we're gonna get married.
The young hot ball and chain.
Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!
What?
Yes?
Here.
Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.
Because weddings are a great place to meet women, and when I dance, I look like this...
Yes, we don't get married unless there's a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight then there's a definite sign that we should get married.
Oh, good!
Does anybody know me?!
You'll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.
You don't even have a car!
That's right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!
Really?
Yeah?
You're welcome.
Oh man! I am so excited-I may vomit!
Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.
Well, it does not ring a bell with me...
Whoa-wh-wh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?
Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know she's too international, y'know she's never gonna be around.
Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.
Did you hear that?
Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
I thought your time ran out.
He thought you said gonad.
I was not flirting.
Yeah, baby!
I know, I know, I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop out of her head.
But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, because my Mom won't let me cross the street.
No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today.
Sorry!
That's it?
And the bunny got away.
Hello Rachel.
Say again?
Okay, hating this.
Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?
No. He.....he's coming out of his shorts.
Look, are you gonna be ok?
Oh, uh, yeah... I just knew that sometimes when you're writing, you... you don't always know the exact time.
Okay.
Hey look, are we gonna have to bring this out every time Ross comes over?
I do?
Hey.
See ya. Goodbuy you fruit drying psychopath. So you want me to help you unpack your stuff?
Was his question what's more boring than him?
Work on your music?
So, uh, how often can you do it?
If that doesn't keep kids in school, what will?
This is not a sign!
You're shooting with Althea?!
Well?
Why?
With extra pulp?
I'll take one. Sometimes I like to hold stuff like this and pretend I'm a giant.
Well that would be nice. I'll go get the lotion.
What about the time difference?
Yeah, well...
Hey.
All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right now!
Nope, nope, I'd just ah, I'd rather talk to you. Yes, I do. Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom.
Bob here.
What's going on?
Hey, woah, hey, woah.
Oh, come on, there's a rest stop right up there! Come on, I really have to goooooooooo.
It's me. I'm the other guy.
Right. So uh, have you written yours yet?
Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.
So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.
Well, y'know, you're-you're gonna meet somebody! You're a great catch! Y'know when I was telling all those guys about you, I didn't have to lie once.
Okay, hold on. Okay.
Who jumps at loud noises!
Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you?
Okay, so we've established my name, and hit me. But theoretically y'know, I mean say we weren't friends, say it's a blind date. I show up at your door, and I'm like "Hey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey."
I made a...
A pen.
Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.
Well that's not an, even a real fish. No, that's a goldfish cracker.
Out loud?
So is he housetrained or is he gonna leave little bathroom tiles all over the place? Stay. Good, STAY! Good fake dog.
Oh my God!
No-no-no-no, we're done.
Yeah?
All right look, I'm changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer.
Nothing, I just like to go like this.
Now, it's not wrapped because I just, just finished it.
Had the money in the wrong hand.
That's the perfect amount!
That's nice.
I'm not even getting married! Okay, this is a question for science fiction writers!
Okay...
Because I went to an all boys high school and God is making up for it.
Pudo aver sido General Tso!
Come on Monica, it's our Valentine's Day. Please? Please-please, please?
Hi! How'd it go?
There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!
I can't belive it.
That's right! I'm not!
Yes, he is!
Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word, "Yippee!" just ignore me.
We're very happy for you.
It's my joke.
Marry me.
We should always always break up together.
Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?
Why? Do you another boyfriend in there or something?
Waitress. Got it. You guys wanna play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What else?
Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice.
Nope, not this time.
Noo!! You don't have a boyfriend because....I don't, I don't know why you don't have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend.
What are you doing tonight?
I did pay for half of it.
Oh, I can't go.
I don't like your massages.
Of course, I didn't get to enjoy any of that, because Joanna's such a big, dull dud!
And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.
Oh-ho-ho-ho-no! No! No switching! No sharing, and don't come crying to me! Ha-ha-ha! I may just sit here and have my cake all day! Just sit here in the hallway and eat my...
Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.
Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursday's was just our thing man!
All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?
And weenie number two has it. Unless, of course, nine-down, Knights in White Satin was sung by the Doody Blues.
Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era.
Ok.
Pierce Brosnan?
Oh, you must stop shooping.
Come on, pick up, pick up! Hello? Transit Authority? Yes, hello. I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus. Yes I do realize that would be a very stupid charact er.
What?
It's nice.
I see.
I thought it was $98.50.
Oh, I thought that's what they used to cover Connecticut when it rained.
Happy Anniversary, 10 months!
Do you know which one you're gonna be?
That's very funny. We done now?
Yeah let's head off to work.
All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down. What?
Okay, 'cause that's not gonna get annoying.
You know I think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh, you know, isn't capable of that emotion.
What?
What stupid thing did you do?
Uh, yeah, I just got my pick-up sticks back from the shop. Bring your nerves of steel.
The cushions are the essence of the chair!
Excuse me. Hi.
Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.
So how's it going there in Financial Services?
I was making a coconut phone with the professor.
What?
Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere.
Will you excuse me I have to um.....
You didn't get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?
Look, maybe I got carried away before. But there's something you gotta know. If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best.
Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!
Another hard 8.
Pretty good! I told her.
We said seven!
All right, y'know what, we've been talking about London too much haven't we?
No!
Well, like father, like son.
Easy tiger.
Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she's-she's smart, and funny, and gets you.
Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.
He's not gonna make it, he's stuck in Chicago.
Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.
Hey.
Sure!
Uh-huh!
You know, we don't really take advantage of living in the city.
So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?
Hey.
What are you guys? Like a gang or something?!
Hey.
I can't sleep now.
Why?
Yes you can. You're thinking about time, you can't go back in time.
Fine!
When was the last time you saw her wear it?
Hey!
Okay!
Dude! That's my girlfriend!
You'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and I'm gonna end up alone. Will you promise me something? When you're married, will you invite me over for holidays?
Sure!
Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game! Last night!
Okay, but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter than I am.
What happened? What happened?!
Youre not gonna lose him.
No thanks, Mom!
Oh yeah!
We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.
Oh, well thank you in advance.
Well, I told you not to walk. Here. There. Okay.
Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor.
Y'know what? Forget it! We are just hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.
Oh, well, that's great!
I think it's winning.
Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with? Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. Y'know, I feel like I've lost her.. Ba-!
Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?
Oh-oi-ho, yeah!
I KNEW IT!!!!
Hey!
Yeah, I'm not in that.
Hey!
Absolutely.
For camp!
No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?
Top of the world? Dock of the bay? I'm out.
Maybe we shouldn't pay our phone bill-free phone sex.
Wh-wh-why?!
Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?
Y'know when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look, you don't, you don't do that every year do you?
Phoebe, are you having a heart attack?!
Yeah, I coulda counted to three like four times without all this 'two' talk.
Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!
Phase Three! I just achieved Phase Three!
C'mon, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy, Huh? Huh? Huh?
I can't believe it! We're here!
Wait! You look? You-you massaged me.
Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.
In a bad way?
Okay, I'm going to go stand over there.
Ok, let's do Julie. What's wrong with her?
No! You're the sweetest!
Oh my god!
Aww.
Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?
So is your apron. You're wearing it like a cape.
Okay.
I don't think so.
Yeah, it's beautiful.
Uh, The Wheatsheaf.
Do I still call you Ross?
All right, let's get some perspective here, ok? These things, they happen for a reason.
Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?
It's not a big deal. It's, just it's right here, and it's all the time.
All right, let's play one more hand! One more!
Yeah! No! No! No! Don't fall asleep! Okay, I am going to make you some coffee. And I probably won't spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor.
So y'know, uh, when's he getting back?
All yours babe.
That's our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why don't I just-why don't I just cover you for a while?
How can she be great if she's from Poughkeepsie? That joke would've killed in Albany.
A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
Just practicing. You're good. Carry on.
Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I'm saying?
You mean the spitter?
Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke-(Yelps in
She said yes!! She said yes!! Awful play, man. Whoah. Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way. Oh, listen, the usher gave me this to give to you.
Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?
And thats the Chrysler Building right there.
Oh that's so sweet! I want to show you something too!
Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.
They couldn't be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.
Y'know what, I can handle it, handle's my middle name. Actually it's the ah, middle part of my first name.
Okay, keep saying it!
: What do you need, what do you need?
Oh no, you see, actually it is.
Look, maybe we should go?
Okay, here you go. I have two queens, what do you have?
....with??
Well it's not Sean Penn.
So, what do you think?
Well, you...don't look good Joe.
If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom.
Am not!
So what job did you get Joe?
My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross!
Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.
My-Oh my God!
No, not us... Us!
'S'why I'm dancing...
We're not gonna talk about girth are we?
A face ass?
Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special. Y'know, technically we still are over international waters.
.
Oh fresh air!
Oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?
I'm gonna call and get off work tomorrow!
Yes.
Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?
Really?! You do that?
Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?
Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll-Ups?
Nina? Nina. Nina. Nina.
Well, I just thought it'd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.
It just doesn't...feel like we're breaking up.
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. . She's insane, the woman is insane. It's before work, it's after work, it's during work. She's got me doing butt clenches at my desk. And now, they won't bring me my mail anymore.
Hi.
Mom. Thanks for wearing something.
Yes that would have made more sense.
Okay.
Okay. All right.
Alright, we're gettin' closer.
Oh, I know. This must be so hard. Oh, no. Two women love me. They're both gorgeous and sexy. My wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight.
I did, but...
If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?
Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but I'm...
Hey, big...
No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?
Okay, well, it's definite, two more weeks of winter.
It's a four.
Thanks.
Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different. I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, ... boom.
All right, fine, you know what, we'll both sit in the chair. I'm soooo, comfortable.
Sorry man.
Sure! That's one of the great things about being engaged. I'm not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore.
Okay, so when do you want to go?
Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one's free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one's free.
Alrighty.
I've had a very long, hard day.
I'm sorry too.
Okay! Listen, I'm gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent.
Okay! This is it! We're gonna get married!
Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let me get through it, because it's, it's, it's not gonna be easy.
Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhoff impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right?
I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.
Well, those were seals, man.
I'll take that.
You got me.
In a foreign, romantic country...
It's not all juice!
Yeah o-, OK, alright. Doesn't matter, time for Baywatch.
I was not flirting.
You are totally and completely 100% forgiven.
Y'know Pheebs, it's kinda our anniversary.
What?!
Thanks man.
I'm sorry man, there's never a good time to stop catching on fire.
Yeah, I'll go get one.
It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very were gonna be having all the sex.
Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.
Yeah, I remember.
Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben, will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?
Scotch on the rocks, with a twist, on a coaster? Ha-ha, Monica! Monica!
Okay, but this is the last time. With a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there. Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick--chickeeeen.
Right!
Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
How do you not fall down more?
Who's he huggin'?
So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.
OK. Brake left, gas right?
Check out the ring.
That was like 5 years ago.
Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer. See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.
Let's go!
Well, what if all my stuff was here?
Hey!
Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve.
Isn't that what happened with you and the bride's maid?
I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer.
No actually, I was just going for colorful.
But you found the keys to his clothes?
Which I may say, right now, is out of control.
I don't wanna know what Monica got me. Y'know? I mean, look, I'm sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not what Christmas is about.
Yeah umm, they're called wallets.
Dee, the sarcastic sister from Whats Happening.
Hey.
I can't believe we are even having this discussion.
Like what?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called "Invisible things for Kathy." Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?
And last but not least.
That's the stuff!
Oh the humanity.
No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.
Because he's crazy. Okay? He came up to me earlier and thanked me for my very moving performance in Titanic.
Oh well, that's uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!
Hello children!
Were you're parents happy, or something?
Hey!
Do you want me to be afraid of you?
Wait a minute, wait. You're telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn't want you back?!
Please tell me you got the message!
That's not funny.
Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!
Hey! You okay?
What about things that are already gold?
Why is Phoebe singing to Carl Mulden?
I've found.
Hey.
Well, I could make it seem like he's here. "Here's some little known facts about cous-cous. They didn't add the second cous until 1979."
Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!
Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my name, and, uh... ...hi.
So-If you wear that you'll make mine less special.
You knew about this?
Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?
I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so, so sorry.
Hey, Pheebs!
All right, check it out. Check this out. It says here that there's a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! "It's almost as good as being there."
Hey.
Yeah.
What are you doing?
You're coming on to the entire room! I'm Chandler.
Yeah?
Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
What'd you rent?
I'm going to the bathroom now.
Hey, shut up!! You're not my real Mom!!
And there's daddy!
Hey!
Stay out of my freezer!
Monica's wasted.
I'm tellin' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain.
Yes. Yes.
What's it about?
Y'know, I've had dates like this.
No!
What are you writing?
What?!
Well, let's just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.
Here, here!
I always thought having a heart attack was nature's way of telling you to die! But you're not gonna die. I mean, you are going to die, but you're not gonna die today. I wish I was dead.
Hi there.
Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. I'll do it.
Oh man!!
Because I'm cooler.
Hey!
Unfortunately that is correct.
Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him. I think somebody should have it.
Huh? Where, whaddya mean?
So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.
Your sister Ursula.
Hey.
That's right.
Sounds like a fun party.
I can't believe I did this! What an idiot!
It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable.
So we both finished our vows.
Well, that went well.
Hey!
Actually Monica and I are engaged.
The key's stuck in the lock.
So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, we're on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.
Ok, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky.
Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?
Raymond Chandler.
7:15. Watch doesn't work.
Huh.
Our guy smells incredible.
Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our relationship.
I can't believe you don't know what I do for a living!
Yeah, it's annoying, isn't it?
Why?
Yeah, for about 30 minutes.
Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. Little tip: if youre ever in a similar situation, never ever leave your hand... ..on the desk.
Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! And there's another reason too.
Oh-no-no-no! Don't! Don't! See-see, you're getting me confused, I'm starting to urn.
Yeah we do!
...betrothed couple.
So great things are happening at work and in your personal life!
What if I never find someone? Or worse, what if I've found her, but I dumped her because she pronounced it "supposably"?
And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place....
Fine, let's do it.
Whoa-whoa-whoa! We're having kids?!
Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.
No freakshow, she's fictional.
You got the lead in a movie? That's amazing! What's the movie about?!
We are switching back, right now!
Really?!
Oh thanks.
Hey!
Hiya doin' pumpkin?
Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah, thanks.
Hey!
Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!
Umm, this is nice.
Yeah, well. It's the right thing to do.
All right look, if you're not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!
Oh that's great! Great! Thanks! But that dress I mean it's like yuck! It's terrible! It makes me wanna just rip it right off of you!
Isn't Ben in this?
This coming from the man who couldn't split our 80 dollar phone bill in half.
Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?
Oh, it's a website, it's the, uh, the Guggenheim museum. See, she likes art, and I like funny words.
Hey!
Hey that's what I tell girls about me.
Not really.
You got it.
Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.
Ohhh.
Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!
Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings! Don't cry outloud.
Oh God.
Then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back.
Hey, mister tux!
Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...
I know, that, that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid.
They have that on the napkins at the club.
That's great!
Marcel?
And, we're done with the yogurt.
No.
Your little men are gonna get scored on more times than your sister.
Ooooohh!
Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesn't try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.
You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.
Yeah so, Tuesday?
Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!
You didn't see how mad he was, y'know?
Are you looking at naked tribe's women?
Don't worry.
Would you just please....give me the receipt 'cause this is great. It's top notch.
Nope, not under here!
That's what you should say.
Oh my God!
Listen Phoebe, he's right. People are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31.
I hear ya. But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!
Woooo!!!
Joe?
It's happened to you?
I'm good.
Well it you don't know that, then I don't want to do this with you.
Ooooh.
Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him! I wanna talk to him!
I sure did.
There are seven?! That's one?
Your liking it, huh?
We were playing poker, alright...
I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
You okay over there?
She's smart and funny, y'know? We were up all last night talking, she said the funniest thing about--what?
I'm sorry. If you ask me, I'd move in with him.
Why would our guy be a weirdo?
Yes, it is.
What picture?
Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?
Guys? I've got something important to tell ya. Guys? Guys?! I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.
I happen to know a Fun Bob.
This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.
Okay so you mean no as in, "Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Let's discuss it before we reject it completely."
So uh, what are you in for?
Next time you snore, I'm rolling ya over!
Here you go. Now stop bringing us pizzas you.
Yes, here it comes! I'm stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? Well I don't think so mister!
Your boyfriend is so cool.
It is starting to get dark out there.
Okay, so this time I won't quit!
Y'know uh, you didn't really have to help me pack.
Oopsey, missed it!
Wait a minute, all jokes aside? I didn't agree to that!
What, no, "Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?"
Well, the heart wants what it wants. I'll see you later.
Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians.
Ahhhh!
What?!
All right! Let's do it!
Knock, knock.
No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I can't get myself right out of them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and I'm cold, and
Have you ever been with a woman?
Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-
Yes, but for the last time.
It's my game. You want the job or not?
Men are here.
Monica and I almost got married last night.
Oh, okay. Send her in.
Okay great.
Hey.
Well he's probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.
No. Not anymore.
Six-hour trip to London. That's a lot of Monica.
Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didn't get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
All right, all right, I'll go sleep with my girlfriend. But I'm just doing it for you guys.
Op, foot in a puddle, foot all in a puddle.
Yes! Yes! A thousand times, yes!
Skidmark's still got a way with the ladies.
No. No. We're not gonna do that, y'know why? Because its not an even trade.
The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell.
Screw the Knicks!
The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.
I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.
What?
Listen, Phoebs, this is gonna be OK. Ross, Russ. Russ, Ross.
Man, she is really gullible.
Y'know those big-big uh, road signs that say "Merge?"
Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.
Me too.
They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit.
You're definitely scaring here.
You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?
Not if I kiss you first.
Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this.
I have my reasons.
Hey, stick a fork in me, I am done.
Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!
Yeah, we'll be down in like five minutes.
What, you guys really think that I'm that shallow?
Oh, that's Ross's.
And protected them from a tornado?
Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.
You made pottery?
Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it! {Whoa! Where have I heard that before? Matthew Perry talking about signs in Las Vegas. I guess it must've been some movie I saw.} What do you say?
I know, I know, but you're gonna have plenty of chances. There are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over.
Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't know... Pictionary?
Clunkers?! Oh my god!
I'm never gonna find a roommate, ever.
Wait, we can't do this.
What?
Hey.
Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is having one of her boobs redused. It's a whole big boob story.
What?
Hey, y'know what we can do? Y'know, now that we are up? We can just like talk to each other all night long, y'know like we did when we were first going out. It'd be fun!
Hey! Hi! You uh, ready to exchange gifts?
Yeah?
What???
Thank you! Today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like it was no big deal.
Why not?
She has a real name.
Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, "Quack, quack!" I'm happy all the time!
I know!
Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
Oh-I don't know.
It's Paris, who knows we're here!
No! No! No!
Well, maybe it was God, doing me.
Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday.
We don't, really.
Because I'm in love with Monica!!
Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something.
Yeah!
Yeah, I'm sorry man. You wanna go watch?
Hey, it's me.
Hey! What's up?
We should start with the big stuff. Y'know? That'll be the easiest. Uh, let's start with the couch. I got it.
Sweet mother of all that is good and pure.
Yeah, all right.
So...
Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped.
Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!
Well, I'm going to kill you.
I messed up. Okay? I'm sorry, I really messed up.
Look, I'm sorry. Okay? I'm weak, and pathetic, and sorry.
I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?
Hey! Happy birthday.
You think we're ready for something like that?
No, she's not okay? And I'll prove it to you. I'm gonna call her right now. Phone's done ehh.
What... did you get me there?
Oh, I don't know, a million?
Oh, so you're going with the teacher, huh?
Janice was my safety net, ok? And now I have to get a snake.
Yes, apparently Stevie and the band are like this.
OK.
Our minister...
Hey, y'know what, if you're gonna do that, if you're gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler. Oh, come on! Chandler's funny, sophisticated, and he's very loveable, once you get to know him.
How is that worse?!
Well there you go.
The door hasn't been locked in five years, but okay! Ready?!
Well don't you see how gross that is? I mean that's like you using my toothbrush. You used my toothbrush?
No-no-no-no!
Hey, what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be at work?
Yes, you can pass for 19.
I'm intrigued.
That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night.
Ah! Ahh!! Ahh!!
Definitely roses. Well, I just think they're a little more weddingy. But Lilies are the clear choice.
You've reached Monica and Chandler's, if you're listening to this message, we're probably screening. Yeah we are.
So- you can tell?
Well, Ross and Emily aren't gonna use it.
You can tell us.
Okay.
Oh, hello Rachel.
I like this girl, okay, I seriously like this girl, you now how sometimes I tend get a little defended and quipy...
Yes, yes she is. Didnt I memo you on this? See, after I let her go, err, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen-nen, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flan.
So you uh, want to do something tonight?
My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.
Well that would help the pride thing.
I can't believe you did this.
You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kinda true.
I talked to Janice.
Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?
I asked myself that very question, sir. Uh, this is Monica. This is my boss, Doug. Doug this is Monica.
4:00 A.M.
See ya. Have fun planning your mellow bachelor party.
We share a wall! So either he's great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.
No way!
Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?
Yeah.
And to you too, Helen.
Hi, Nina. Come on in.
Well, close to...
Ahhhh-gaaaahhh. Eddie what're you still doin' here?
Oh yeah!
Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.
Why not?! I mean it's just, it's just climbing! It's just, it's just steep!
So what are you gonna do?
Guess who's back in show business.
Whoa, she's pretty.
You can't just call Monica's room.
I-never borrowed your Walkman.
C'mon, we're roommates! My eyes!! My eyes!!
No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they are.
No! No! Not, Paris.
Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?
Let it go!!
Wow! She looks great. Doesn't she?
All right! Fine! I'm going. But when I get back it's chair sitting, and I'm the guy who's....sitting in a chair!
So.... I quit.
Well you might if it were anything like 7!
Ehh, you're just liquored up.
'Cause he was just so darn cute.
Nice!
What?
So Dan, nurse not a doctor huh? Kinda girlie isn't it?
There we go little fella.
Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!
More coffee over here, please!
Well, you couldn't have looked everywhere or else you would've found her!
And uh, you don't have a mustache which is good. I'm Chandler; I make jokes when I'm uncomfortable.
Listen Eddie, um, I've been thinking about our current living situation and uh, why are you smiling?
Eh...
Yes, I did. I told it to Dan at work, and he said it was the funniest joke he'd ever heard.
Alright, hang on a second there Custer.
No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.
No!
Oh, I don't think I ever heard that story.
And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this.
Ross!
Uh, the book?
Oh, so that's what this is for.
No!! You can't!!
I'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay, it was like she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I just-I didn't know what it was!
Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here.
Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.
Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, he'll never be President. There's never gonna be a President Joey.
Just a little bit of sugar.
Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon. I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?
I had one.
Okay .
Why must everybody watch me sleep? There'll be no more watching me sleep, no more watching.
He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!
No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen for you.
Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?
What Richard thing?
I don't know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office.
Easy for you to say; you'll be wearing a veil.
Well, you don't you have Captain Hook explain it to her.
Me and Frank and Phoebe, Graduation 1965.
To her face? Look it's the end of the date, I'm standing there, I know all she's waiting for is for me to say 'I'll call her' and it's just y'know, comes out. I can't help it, it's a compulsion.
What a geek!
Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents!
You know when guys hang out they don't just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?
I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.
Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that.
What is going on?
Hello-dillillio!!
This is going in your book?
I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?
So, we gettin' a fish?
Why haven't you told them?! Wouldn't they be happy?!
Oh no thanks. I don't like any thing from my Scottish heritage.
I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work! He does not know that I am not some of us.
Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.
All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?
Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.
Well seeing that drunk Santa wet himself, really perked up my Christmas.
No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.
At a fake game!!
So whaddya got there Monica?
Uhh, 9.
Yeah, it's like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!
Honestly? Me too.
Yeah.
Well, maybe you don't marry this one.
'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this.
Tell me it's "you and me" we.
I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!
Hey, it's me. I know you can't stand to be in the same room as me, so I just thought I'd try and apologize over the phone. All I...
No. No, see when I first meet somebody it's uh it's mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating.
Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.
So what are you going to do?
There's a Mr. Bing!
All right, check out this bad boy. 12 megabytes of ram. 500 megabyte hard drive. Built-in spreadsheet capabilities and a modem that transmits at over 28,000 b.p.s.
I did not say fat! I said, "Fa-aa-aw-ow..."
Phoebs, play with meeee.
Bad London!
Okay. But it is officially nighttime.
How do you know so much about this?
Thank you! Thank you!
Are you all right?!
I've got five bucks says you can't.
Yes!
Neat. I'm gonna die alone.
Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings?
Hey, kids.
You mean scared.
Y'know what? I don't trust you with this cake anymore! And I got it first, and I'm takin' it back!
Ross and the most beautiful girl in the world.
Hey!
Ha! Ha! Ha!
Your cappucino sir.
Yes!
All right!
Oh, right, right, shut up.
Who are those people?
We're worried about you.
Stop talkin' to your men.
She's not gonna say no.
Well why didn't you stop her?! Why didn't you just tell her it was a plan?!
Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!
Oh, that was my work laugh.
Yo!! Spackel boy! Get up!
Yeah.
Me asking is kind of a sign.
All right, I'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like that I'll lie.
Hey!!
Okay, so you will meet our guys?
I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking.
What?
This, this actually is a...
Are you aware that you're still talking?
Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not.
Well, only if you order stuff.
Hey.
Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother's not going to punch me. Are ya?
Really? Struck down in the pribe of libe!
Not once did we do that.
Hey.
Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here for you later. Hey, how about maroon?
Please tell me you know which one is our baby.
What are you doing here?
Yeah?
Goodnight.
Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask!
Okay, excuse me for a minute.
Yeah, I wanna go to babe.
Oh, that's-that's okay, no problem.
Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for tonight, right?
No! No! I don't want him to know we're yet! I'm not sure I'm ready for that. And besides he's not gonna be too happy to see me either.
Hey Mon, how's it going?
How about Joey... Pepponi?
Now imagine you live at the supermarket.
Wish it! Hi. Hi, I-I was just sitting over there, and uhh, Chandler. My name is Chandler. Did I say that?
You really think that is what he meant?
If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do.
Good luck.
Oh my God, introduce us!
Hey! Here's a dollar, consider it a deposit. Please sing at our wedding.
Oh, just a bit of shopping. How've you been?
'Cause it's gross.
Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut.
So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.
And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others.
Absolutely!
What?
Question. If I don't care about my watch, can I use it as a weapon?
Well, I don't see that we have a choice. But, when we're back home, we don't do it.
Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman! What's this?
Yeah me too.
No.
Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles.
Oh-ho-ho-ho.
It's not gonna be exactly like last time.
Absolutely!
Honey, it's gonna be okay.
He's right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want.
A hot girl's at stake and all of the sudden he's Rain Man.
Okay, so he's out of here.
Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this.
Okay, look, I'm gonna have to ask you all to leave.
Well, I'm guessing he wants to do a little dance. . . ya know, make a little love. . . well pretty much get down tonight.
I'm hangin in. . . and a little out.
They do?
Yeah, we're gonna have to get you out of those shoes.
No. No, I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before.
I can't believe she's married.
Yeah. I really do.
Oh that's not true.
I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!
Well, you're not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes...
You're right.
What did you do when they found out?
No sir.
You know that thing, when you and I talk to each other about things?
Yeah, I wanted to make a dramatic scene, but I hate packing.
Hey, guys, it's after midnight, merry Christmas everyone.
Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he'll be there. And he'll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that you're really hot.
Yeah. Thanks for making me do this.
Y'know you, really didn't have to take me to the airport.
There you go! There you are!
Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You can't offer anything to us!
You couldn't have at least changed your shirt.
Because we hate them.
Oh it's always nicer to here than, "Aw crap! You again!"
Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?
Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?
Fine!
Yes. Vividly.
Monica.
Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!
I was not trying them out, Susie asked me to wear them.
It's your timer.
No, you sh-No you said you made that up!!
American Express?
What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.
Aren't you just a tinsy bit curious?
There are snow cones! Snow cones! Yuck!
Ok, they're coming, shhh.
I know. See, yes. That's Yasmine Bleeth, she's a completely different kind of chick. I love you both. But in very different ways.
Thanks.
Well, it's good that you finally have a place to do that.
Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break.
Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay, I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth.
Ooh, let me talk to him!
I just don't see why those two can't work things out!
When'd you meet her?
What?
How drunk are you?
Oh, ahh, no thanks, I just had an M&M.
All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y'know, you're gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.
Oh, good!
Because, I'm too afraid.
Yeah.
The only way that I said six would be if the seven's, let meet at seven, not at six.
Now Monica, I know you're upset, but don't forget. There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then there's going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris.
Joey?
I'm still right here!
Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, I'm-I'm talking to ah, . This is the part where you say your name.
Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't it?
You don't turn and slide, you throw it out! I'm tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!
Robert's coming out.
That's ok.
Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.
All right, I'm nine years old.
Good-good-good-good.
I was not and oh God, shh!
Okay, we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier.
How do you know that? How?
I do like that.
No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.
Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke.
Okay, well I won't uh, worry about this anymore then.
I love you so much.
I don't know. But I-I-I know I love you!
Santa pants. Santa Claus's pants.
Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can't just stare through the peep hole for three hours! You're gonna get peep eye!
Hey!
Yeah, check out the ring.
Well that's the brilliance of it. The pretty people... and the running.
He just said, "No strippers."
No, I realize that honey, but I'm not gonna spend all of the money on one party.
Well, there you are! So what did Elizabeth say?
All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference...
Ahh, ooh, try a hard 8.
Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the bride's maid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, you're not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya?
You are really frightening me.
You got waaaay too much free time.
Pheebs!!
Come on! I was there! I know he's the love of your life.
All right, call it in the air.
What?
Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?
What, you never look down in the shower? Oh please. I'm not allowed to make one joke in the monkey-is-penis genre?
I need to talk to you, it's urgent!
What's the matter honey?
If I was a superhero who could fly and be invisible, that would be the best.
No Rach, it's not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly wasn't that much fun.
Easy Lenny.
Hey, don't worry. I figure it'll be 2 hours to Phoebe's dad's house, they'll meet, they'll chat, they'll swap life stories, we'll still have plenty of time.
Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.
No, look, that's it, it's over, I want you out, I want you out of the apartment now.
I KNEW IT!!!!
In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
So, you still don't think I'm boyfriend material?
Give him money? It was a joke!
Thank you! All right, I gotta go unpack.
Yeah?
You did.
Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. We should take a trip.
Yeah! You?
I'll get you the Cliff Notes.
OK, let's do it. What?
Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.
We're not gonna lose to girls.
I'm so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! You should've seen her. Writing, writing, writing!
It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor.
Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!
Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to Beefsteak Julie's...
Sorry.
Richard!
Oh, I think I have the cash.
Well, it's official there are no good movies.
Hey, my Father's house does that!
What are you guys doing together?
Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants. If y'know what I mean.
Oh, the tears are real.
Before or after you were shot by your own troops?
I said, "Like what?"
So uh, what's this thing you're auditioning for?
Yay!
Yes I'm gonna put it back exactly where I found it.
Okay well, this side looks bigger. Uh... There's more crust on this side. Y'know? So, maybe if I measured...
This isn't one of those uh, y'know "If she doesn't come, we-we don't, we don't come?" Right? Because I already bought my ticket...
We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard.
Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?
What? Nothing.
Hey-hey-hey. So what happened? A forest tick you off?
What do you mean?
Ross, just for my own piece of mind, you're not married to anymore of us are ya?
Okay, great.
When we were?
OK, I was wrong, that's what they used to cover Connecticut.
No-no-no-no. Hey!
What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.
Well this is just sad!
This sounds like a hernia. You have to-you-you go to the doctor!
Hey! I'm sorry! That- where are you going?
Ohh yes.
Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection.
You mean like, music?
Count of three?
Had it.
There are seven?!
I don't know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.
Oh God, kindergarten flashback.
Y'know we already went over this and I won!
Okay, wait. All right, that's it, okay, I'm out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore!
Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there.
No way!
Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
The reason he just said.
Well, uh, we can talk about that too Pheebs.
Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!
Oh my good God.
Hey, where you been?
Oh my God!
And a date with a man!
How much did I love The King and I?
I'm just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you're okay.
Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?
She was not good. Not good.
Whoa!
For three years?
Bye.
Where's Mary-Angela?
Excuse me?
Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!
Hey.
Why?! What happened?!
Who?
Hey.
Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue!
Okay.
And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy.
Oh, what a crappy night!
Really? He does? Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks!
Hey, check out that girl! She is really hot!
Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word, "Yippee!" just ignore me.
I do.
Actually, me too.
Come on, tell me.
Well, you're welcome. And tell them we're really glad they're coming.
I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.
All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!
No-no-no-no, I've supported you one hundred percent and I want to prove that to you in person!
Not fun anymore?
Hey!
Oh. Oh, God!
Okay, so I guess that's about ah, two weeks before the topless thing kicks in.
Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!
Would you come on! Come on! Thank you.
Let's go quicker.
Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states.
That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy. I've always wanted to know...
My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!
The big deal is I was sitting there last, so, that's my seat.
Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!!
Well, somebody should.
Goodnight.
Okay, good.
Oh, it's not just that, I would be England's most powerful weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty's secret service. A man who fears no one; with a license to kill. Would Monica let me wear this?
You slept with the stripper?
I hope she throws up on you.
Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?
I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.
C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by "No thanks, it's late."
Hi.
So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?
Okay.
Joey... Switzerland?
Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.
She's just doing her job!
Oh no-no-no, you don't want to do that, then you're gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.
Well, yeah actually.
Oh I'm so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?
Man, I am so beat.
Well let's see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that's plural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing Bing! Great apartment Chandler Bing, Bing!
Oh, and Ive got Earth Science, but I'll catch you in Gym.
What?
What's going on?
Lose the other guys.
No, I got him.
OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.
Hey.
Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment!
Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now.
Oh, aaaah!
Rach, Rach, we gotta settle.
Or Casey.
This is the New York Times.
Y'know, I-I can't really put a price on that Joe.
Because it says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate Monica" on the bottom.
Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area?
Could you get us a couple of beers?
I know!!
Hi, it's me.
I stole Monica's and changed the name.
Well, it's not like I went to Spain. I went to the bathroom, you knew I was coming back.
Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?
Oh my God that's it, that's the ring! How much is it?
And he's not speaking metaphorically.
Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I just stopped talking!
Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know..
Let me see the earrings.
Gotcha!
That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie.
I love you too.
Well, I suppose I'd have to say you!! But, what if we're watching a movie in here?
So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.
Yeah.
Well I do, but uh, Eddie makes them this way and, well they're pretty darn good.
Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip Joe.
Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.
What was tonight?
Okay, okay. So, should I call her?
Who's Rick?
Ya know I think this is much better than the coffee house.
Yeah?
Yes!!
Whoa-whoa-whoa, what are we going to do about my job?
Oh yeah, I should probably call them.
Y'know what maybe it's gonna be okay, I mean it's been a week.
Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!
Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y'know? Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn't think I was y'know, all dead inside.
Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?
Okay.
Yeah.
Hey!
Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...
Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how 'bout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours?
Hey!
I can see it now, "Look dad, it's the Sphinx!"
Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not.
Freedom! I want my freedom! Why won't you here me?! Sophie, help me! Help me!!
And I think Ross is generous too.
Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!
Ohh. Mmm.
I'm doing this because I'm sorry?
Yeah, I wouldn't know having missed everything.
Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room.
Janice, you're--
Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
Y'know, we haven't found anybody else.
Oh you knew that. Good!
Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor.
Then...who did?
Yeah... Bunny-rabbit.
Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!
Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?
Okay.
If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' everybody with me.
Uh, hey!
Well, your kind of sitting in my seat.
Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area.
But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night. I mean it was, it was like when we first started living together.
Ok, that's me.
Whoa! Don't know about that.
What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
Okay. I'm gonna get the ring! I'm gonna get the ring! I'm gonna go find her and I'm just going to propose!
What?!
Yo, paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec? Your tailor is a very bad man!
Well, we used there's up last night making scary faces.
Good luck.
Yeah! You wanna come?
You're watching a football game at a funeral?
Hey.
What's wrong?
What?!
Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold separately.
Y'know I'm-I'm really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.
We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes.
No. No!
Well this one's for you.
Because I'm very happy for him! And you, you lucky dog!
Perfect decibel.
You're building a post office?
Would you like to have dinner sometime?
She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend.
Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?
No, that's all right. I just had a jar of mustard.
You.
See? They're Joey's! J-J-J-J-J-Joey's!
I know what you meant!! You notice that ever since we got this chick, we've been fighting a lot more than we used too?
You're not even giving them a chance!
Noo!
...in you, my endless love. My endless love.
How's your room Rach?
Yeah well, I hear the place looks great.
Y'know what would work?
Oh, yes, could I have one of those.
Hey.
Maybe it's the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.
So there is no good time to ask that question.
Oh, y'know what, I'm gonna be okay, you don't have to throw a party for me.
Well believe it baby!
Hey!
No. We were in the middle of sex...and you fell asleep.
Oh no, you'll have to come.
What? Why?
Be right there sweetums. A totally different situation.
Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here.
Yeah, we'll be down in like five minutes.
So apparently we just don't pay for food anymore. Do you see what I see?
Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice.
Oh, I'm packing. Y'know I'm-I'm packing 'cause I'm moving to Yemen tomorrow.
Hi! Nice to meet you!
Did they teach you that in your anger management class?
Rachel, could I see you for a moment?
All right.
It is going to be perfect. I am taking her to her favorite restaurant. I'm going to get her a bottle of the champagne that she really loves; therefore knows how expensive it is. Then when the glasses are full, instead of proposing a toast I'm just gonna propose.
I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.
It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman, and instead you had to settle for Robin.
So you're just, kinda rubbing it on yourself?
Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.
And you... Ross, I believe, if you check Rachel's bag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there.
"Benefits lapsed."
He had sex with Mr. Girabaldi!
Uh-oh.
So, what're you gonna do?
Oh no, now it's not gonna make any sense!
I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting divorced. I'm such a grown up.
It's gonna be ok. You know that?
Maybe, she doesn't hit him all the time.
So, thanks for having me over! Rach. Pheebs.
I'll talk to them!
Yes.
I see. Y'know umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies.
But are you sure you can do this?
I didn't know you were taking a class. That is so cool.
Really?
Skull?
Well then, how do you know when vegetables are done?
Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkin' out the Chan-Chan man!
What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
Oh, yeah, I don't know what they were doing, but at one point sea turtles actually came up to the house.
Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen.
Are you funny?
Yes...Yes..Uh-huh, You? We did you.
Well that's good. Because you didn't! And I'm incredibly happy for ya!!
Uh-huh
Oh, yeah.
No, our guy is just a floating head.
So they're going on dates? When?
Don't worry honey, we'll make yours funnier.
No! No! No! I just kissed her.
Oh yeah, yeah! Look what I got, look what I got. See, she's fully dressed, right?
Oh my God!
Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights.
I'll cancel the sodas.
Why her mom?
Hey!
Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didn't get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?
Of course!
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.
Ross!
Okay.
Oh that's not bad, Pheebs?
Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!
What?
Hey!!!
98. 99. 100. Okay, go!
Listen, I gotta talk to you.
Oh y'know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.
You don't like that show?
Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence...
No! No! I support you 100%! I just didn't, I didn't get it right away. Y'know now I'm caught up! Identical hand twins! It's a million-dollar idea!
The hot chicks?
Believe me, I've been saying that for years. Oh my God!
Bye..... ridiculously dull Bobby.
Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.
Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...
A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.
Lie!!! How hard is that?! The check's in the mail! Oh your baby is so cute! I can't wait to read your book Ross!!
Thank you, Mister Drunken Gambler! Okay, you get this and uh, we get the biggest suite in the place! Wait-wait-wait-wait! We get the biggest suite in the place.
Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that I'm related to Monica. How is she?
Joey, I uh! I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.
Don't take this personally okay? It's just that I just can't have sex with a sick person.
Y'know what? I-I kinda have.
Okay.
Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it's feed!
I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y'know? But I have to trick him into taking it so I won't hurt his pride.
Excellent hole, Joe.
Well, what if all my stuff was here?
Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment.
Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.
It's all very, very good. So you wanna go uh, mix it up?
Yeah, I know.
No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate, Momma's Little Bakery. I feel terrible, I'm a horrible, horrible, horrible person.
Hey!
You gotta do it, man.
You're not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?
Hey, you guys!
Hello.
Yes.
Okay!
Hey Eddie. Daahh!! What're you doin' here?
Lets not do that any more.
You win.
Listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. I'm buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night.
Uhhhaahh.
It's my joke.
Stretchy pants! Why, those are the greatest things in the world! If I were you I would wear them every day, every day!
Daaahhhh!
Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?
Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.
I saw you checking me out during the game last night.
Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!
Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!
Really?
Oh, what the hell is that?
I think so.
Bye, momi-moo.
Everything's gonna be all right. Okay, Dick?
Yes?
Really?!
No, it's... fancier than a pimple. Look Ross, why don't you just go see a...
Hey!
That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman.
A pharmacist.
Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!
Because of the weekend, we had a fight.
No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned.
Na, forget it, it's probably stripped and sold for parts by now.
What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!
Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!
Awesome!
I said art lover.
Wow, there's my fantasy come true. No, seriously.
Oh, I don't know man. I haven't talked to her in like ten years.
No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
Oh!
No!
What did you guys just do?!
Ya know, the man's got a point.
That's how radio stars escape stalkers.
Why?
Weirder than watching his two moms make out?
...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
Oh! Oh! That's so hard.
Phoebe knows about us!
I can't seem to say goodbye.
No.
That-that's bad?
Right.
That's right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.
Hey Rach, now that you're working at Ralph Lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?
Oh my God.
Does it matter?!
I am only one man! Okay Ross, time is up!
Yeah, well... Y'know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?
Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever.
So Ross, how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?
You-you-you didn't know that. Well, I guess my work here is done!
Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break?
You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller! The eyesore from the Liberace house of crap!
All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this.
Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.
Hey, Mon.
Are you sure?! Because our guy smells incredible!
I don't sound like that.
Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!
Really?!
I don't believe they're brother and sister.
Well, I'm so confused as to what we've been doing so far...
Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is.
Hey!
Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I'll stop seeing her?
Don't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that?
Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?
Shut-out!!
No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn't take it.
An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didn't wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!
Althea?! What are you doing?!
Well, I just...
Hi, Just Janice.
Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse.
Could I borrow it?
Hike!
I know it would make me happy, ma'am.
Oh yeah, it's beautiful country up there.
I'm free! I'm free!
No, no, you're right, it is a ridiculous name!
Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.
I hope you know what I'm giving up for ya, because she's not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean.
Coffee in a fight!
You really like it?
What? What? What?
Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions.
Rachel lost Marcel.
So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever in-intend on telling me about this?
It still wouldn't be clean. All I want is my freedom.
Ahh, Hotties of the Paleontology Department, there's a big selling calendar, eh?
Hey, is Rachel here?
Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed.
That's a mailman! That's our mailman! Hi. How are ya?
Eh!
...And then he burst into flames.
And you're okay with that?
Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you.
So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?
I hate this thing!
Nothing, nothing.
You can't leave! I have your shoe!
Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?
It's not just their marriage! I mean, look at yours. Look at everybody's! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! And I've met me; I am not Paul Newman. I don't race cars! I don't make popcorn! None of my proceeds go to charity.
Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?
Phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.
Thank you!
Well, that makes me feel so good.
Yeah, we're gonna go.
It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it's bad enough that I'm in love with my roommates girlfriend-which by the way, I think she knows. Because every time we're in the room together there's this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when I've seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she's smooth! Smooth!
Well now you have two. Hey, I am good at math.
Janice, I'm sorry but umm, you can't stay here tonight.
Yes, it is, at Office Max.
Funniest? Heckles?
Ahh, I believe my exact words were, 'Flaign,en - sten'. I mean I didn't know what to say, how do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator?
Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess something.
Hey, you know what I was thinking? When we get married, are you gonna change your last name to Bing?
Yeah!
Do I look fat?
Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party.
But we don't know the neighbors.
Joey kept screaming at me, "Do it now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!!" Sometimes late at night I can still here the screaming.
Why?
Can you people not see me?!
Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.
They do me?
Well, Joey's my best friend.
Buddy?
Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat. . . all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem.
Sorry, we're on a major flan high.
Kathy! Kathy! Hi!! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Fetch! Fetch it! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy.
I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I doing Ebony and Ivory.
Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if you're not careful you may not get married at all this year!
Could've been a peach.
Stop it. Stop it!
Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.
Why not?
Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.
Picking Rachel.
You okay?
Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?
Are you serious?
You have done enough!
Is he the one with the beautiful wife?
And yet, she's still not hanging up the phone.
Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.
Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this.
Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
I'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i was somebody else's subconscious.
Too many jokes... must mock Joey!
OK that's not what he was doing. Alright, he was looking for his bus money.
Hey, all right!
That was there when I got here.
Yeah, I'm gonna pass. 'Cause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies.
Hey! Do we have a baby name yet?
Not that big a deal? There...there was touching of things.
Well, maybe we can fix it y'know? Maybe we can send him some-some big-big flowers and scare him!
Okay. Okay.
Oh, you dont know. Helen, could you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinders raise?
Well, that's not true, he-he smacked you once.
Happy birthday! I'm sorry.
Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.
Okay. Then I guess it's just, wait here then. Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.
Hey.
All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress with Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once! I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.
Oh, well...
Excuse me, Doug? Hey there sports fan!!
Joey...
What?
Yes! You're never gonna make it!
Yeah, well, good luck trying to top the last one.
Guys are signing over their 401-K's to me?
Without me?!
Sounds like a really bad idea to me.
Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism.
That's sweet.
Oh, ooh.
Well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with, and the other one can't get mad.
Okay.
Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say, what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight.
...it was like the Algonquin kids table.
Okay. It's a chicken.
All right, you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place?
What?
Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.
Really stupid.
Okay. Oh yes.
OK, so now we draw cards.
I'm saying that she... is a devil woman! Y'know I mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I hate her! Well, I don't hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really.
Uh, what about y'know the massage thing? That never gave you a heart attack.
See, I'm not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?
Huh.
You did?
Rent?
Ahh, third base.
Well we could just stay in and cook for ourselves.
Yeah, jus' second. Good-bye Mr. Heckles. We'll try to keep it down.
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Uh, Joey is gonna be right back. Right back! Meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you. So, you're old and small.
She answered.
Monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing! Okay? It's crazy. {Finally! The voice of reason.} I mean, just impress Gary and Phoebe we have to go upstairs and have sex over and over and I'm saying no to this, why? Get your coat.
Listen, I'm, I'm sorry I didn't make it over there today.
Do you remember talking to me yesterday?
Diet soda.
You're kidding right?
Oh yeah? Well, how'd she take it?
Is not.
Hi!
Hey Joey, do you wanna play football or you wanna.. Hi, I'm Chandler.
...The second guy.
I'm not your garbage man. I'm your mailman.
Ok, this could be tough.
No!
No, Amish boy.
Thanks!
Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!
Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.
Again true.
Well then why can't I see it?
Well, let's see... Okay uh, is that her?
I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was Deep Impact and which one was Armageddon?
Depends on what you mean by we.
Well, I like danger.
Can I finish my story?!
Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody.
Yeah, and I don't have any cologne.
Because, if Santa and the Holiday...Armadillo? ...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!
Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?
No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
Or a job where you don't have to carry a table.
Really?! I didn't think girls ever just wanted a fling.
First of the month.
Hi! Hi! You're crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.
Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people. Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?
Uhh, Joey's grandmother is right there.
Where is she? I'm not scared of you!
Well, actually just one birthday flan.
Why is that so funny?
All right, let me in.
I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently. It's called being a good conversationalist. Watch. Say something.
So, the ebola virus. That's gotta suck, huh?
Oh, hey guys!
Okay!
Eh..., I don't, I don't know.
Well, you-you know what I meant.
Bob here.
Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.
Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?
Fine with me!
Y'know what? I have been trying to apologize to him all week! If he's not gonna let me do it on the phone, I'm gonna go down there and do it in person.
Now-now, why would you say that Joseph?
Why?
I'm sorry! Hey-hey Joe, why don't you uh, lift up your shirt? Take a look at this kiddo. We have a crying child! Roll the damn cameras!
Okay umm, before I meant you I had really little life and I couldn't imagine growing old with...
Mr. D, hows it going, sir?
Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!!
Okay.
So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?
Well, you do want all that stuff, right?
No, we only went out once.
Well, she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You can understand that, right? Guys? Guys?
Nah, Phoebs, that's the guy that comes in the frame.
Oh. Y'know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn't because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me 'cause, you're really hot! Is that okay?
I hope he did!
Sure, everybody loves a kidder.
Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats.
Y'know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?
Okay, okay, I tell you what. You roll another hard eight; and we get married here tonight.
Yeah, I'll take care of it.
I don't know if I've told you this, but he's kinda tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years
They got a breakfast buffet.
A hundred and forty-five pounds.
Oh no-no-no, that's not-No-no-no!
Thanks. Listen, about the weekly numbers, I'm gonna need them on my desk by nine o'clock.
No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.
Y'know what? We're not sad, we're not sad, we're just not 21 anymore. Y'know? I'm 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!
Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too.
What?
Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!
Hey Joe! I was just watching a movie-e-e...
There's no back to this couch!
Yeah, I've always hated that Howie.
Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get.
Yeah, didn't he tell ya?
Janice?!
Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land.
Oh, good job Joe.
No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous!
Oh all right.
If you said, "Big lima bean, bubbling up." Would she understand the difference?
I was shrieking... like a Marine.
Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class.
Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife.
Well I've forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
Okay. Okay. What are you gonna do to me if you get the part?
About Ross!
You're it! Now run and hide!
Hey.
Hey, you guys! Hey, Ross, quick question for ya. Are you ready to party?
Well, she wasn't sleeping with him.
Right.
I can't believe you got us into trouble.
That's right! Where are the guys? I'm ready to get drunk and see some strippers.
Yeah, well, I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail.
I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.
Well, I didn't do anything. I didn't want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.
You got it. Good woman! Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
I am, I'm ignoring you.
It's okay, I got a plan.
We are. He's meeting us here.
Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!
Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go.
See, that's why I could never be an actor. Because I can't say gig.
Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?
Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.
No, it came out to an even twenty.
Well, we are great guys.
Yeah I even got a ring. Did you get a ring?
Yes, and we're very excited about it.
Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house.
What are you talking about?
Hey.
Yeah.
Hi!
Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.
From a bullet!
Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?
There you go!!
What?
I don't know what to say. I'm sorry that we make more money than you. But we're not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it.
Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn?
Sorry, my my thing was in there with me.
Well, this was great. I'll give you a call. We should do it again sometime.
How did you...know?
That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.
Joey, a woman just stuck her tounge down my throat, I'm not even listening to you.
Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone?
And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight.
There is not one hair on that head.
Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see her tonight. Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight.
Oh, uh, I... don't... care. Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
Hey.
No! Her boyfriend Richard!
No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!
He's not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I'm supposed to do that!
Yeah.
All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.
Uh, could you leave me one?
Then don't leave me!
Oh no, no, no, no.
Ross, it's just a sandwich!
But I just wa...
We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so y'know...
Monica's a little drunk.
Oh-ho, it'll be back. Oh-ho, there's nobody in the room.
Okay. "So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"
Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little Blackjack?
Well, what'd you do?
Yes, you got something from the Screen Actor's Guild.
Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.
So are we...friends again?
Oh I see, I see, because of the third nipple thing. Ha ha ha ha. . .
Helen drinks. Will you marry me?
Oh, hey.
Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.
Stop it! We're doing this! Let's do it!
Wow! That sandwich really does smell good.
Ehh.
And say nothing?
Noo.
Hello!
What?
What? No, I want to watch this. . Did your cable go out?
Really?! I-I thought you weren't looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
Yeah, Ross can't go so it's between my friend Eric Prower who has breath issues and Dan with the poking. 'Did you see that play? Do you want some more beer? Is that Spike Lee?'
Well, Joey, I wrote a little song today. It's called Get Up.
Okay.
And then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked. And then, and then you click it again and she's dressed. She's a business woman, she's walking down the street, she's window shopping, and whoa-whoa-whoa, sh-she's naked!
Hello!
Hey it's Joey!
Yes! Way to go, man! Still got the egg, huh?
Oh, yes. Well it's very beautiful. It's cream-colored and tight I don't mean tight, I mean it's not too tight, not that I was looking at-
Hey listen, come on, Joey is having a problem! A little girl is beating him up.
Okay, it's just weird! Okay? I don't want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I need...I don't know what I need. I need a walk.
I'm going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?
Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
All right look, I think it's time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.
Why am I looking?
Horn-swoggle.
Hey!
Well, that's what we said about Joey...
Why not?!
I had sex today. I never have to answer that phone again.
Okay, there are no famous Joey's. Except for, huh, Joey Buttafucco.
Well, you couldn't have looked everywhere or else you would've found her!
Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!
Well, thank you for lunch.
I can't believe the guys missed this.
What?
Well, did-did you correct him?
I Think It's Great That You Work Here. You'Re Going To Make A Lot Of Money, And Here's Your First Tip. Don't eat yellow snow. . Ah ha ha, 2:15, coffeehouse.
This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program!
Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. Oh.. my.. God.
Shocking! Since you still have the keys.
Wow, Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I. He was right. Would you listen to that?
Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?
What are you supporting?
Fine.
Bad London!
Hey!
Yeah, we really missed you guys.
Where is she, Where is she? Oh, hey, I have a question, where is she?
The food there was, was great.
Okay, I'll do it!
Y'know, I would've bet good money that he'd be the first one of us to get married.
Stop talking, stop talking now. Let me just get this straight. You're actually stealing my hat?
Why don't you open with a joke?
Yes, Bunny?
All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing's right. And that's what deathbeds are for.
Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how I could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth.
What we want honey.
Oh, don't worry about it I mean you probably were tired, you had a lot of champagne, it happens to everybody.
Huh.
Hey! Everybody at work loved you last night!
No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?
Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street.
Oooh, Rich is goin' to the party too, huh?
Yes!
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!
Y'know I think we should invite them.
Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend.
Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go.
Y'know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because, that's you and I together! Merge!
Where have you been?
You know what? I'm not gonna end up like this. I'll see you man.
Really?
And the moment of joy is upon us.
So, ahh, how are ya? How ya...How ya... You okay?
Alright, now try taking a puff.
It was terrible. I fought with my colleagues y'know, the entire time. Are you kidding with this?
Mon, get out here!
What are you doing here?
No, no, no, no, no, no No. Monica, it's Sunday morning. I'm not running on a Sunday.
Hi. Okay, you're too late okay? Because she's already with our guy.
Hm-hmm, I told you! I can't believe that I've only got two hours before I call in sick for work.
That was amazing.
Okay.
Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'
No, Beth doesn't die, she doesn't die. Does she Rachel?
I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
Yeah, big zero gravity moon steps.
I think it's necessary.
Oh it's Bing, sir. I'm sorry , I was just ah...
So, we'll do the rest of the bills later then?
What do we do? What do we do?
You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?
Hello! Little ones.
No-no-no-no-no-no-no, you are not getting me this way.
Yeah, never cheat on Rachel.
Well you know that thing you said before, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued.
Ooh, oh, oh, that's her.
How long you been waitin' to say that?
Hey.
Well, why don't we move this into the bedroom?
Well, I don't know what Big Leon told ya but it's an even thousand if you want me for the whole night. What is this for?
Yeah, come on, it's Ross and Rachel, they've got too.
Well, you remember Cathy Bates in Misery?
So, rocks.
Okay.
Really?
Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here!
Richard used to do it, didn't he?
Let me try it on!
Y'know what, he's right. There's something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain.
Hey!
No, I ah, I didn't do them.
Well where... Where did she go?
Jeez, at 2:30 in the morning, I didn't expect to have to fight over the remote.
Ok, you can not do this to me.
Oh yeah! Okay, let's play again. What do you got?
What's in the bag?
I know, I still am one of these.
Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with one too.
No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading.
And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard.
Yes. Yes!
What just happened?
'Kay!
No, because you're not a grandmother!
Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum.
Look, she's not backing down! She went like this!
You know, I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go out with her again?
Well, you know Phoebs. I don't know if it's your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day.
See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.
The actor playing Mac couldn't do it, they needed to see you at 2 o'clock.
Okay.
Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.
They're not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!
Yeah. You're right. Hey I-I can do that.
Oh okay, I'll-I'll try.
Where ya going?
Oh, they said uh, "You don't have insurance here, so stop calling us."
Oh.
Who are those people?
Okay, I'll give them back. Look! What is so great about that sandwich?
Well, I have kissed over four women. Do you wanna get under the covers?
All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'
Mar-haaaan.
Thanks, it's ah, Gaelic, for 'Thy turkey's done.' So ah, I'm gonna go, nice, nice meeting you.
Okay! I was gonna wait 'til uh, it was official y'know? But I got so excited I just had to tell you guys because you're my best friends.
Big picture please! So I was in the gift shop, and that's when I uh, saw this. New York.) Yeah, y'know what? I thought anything that can fit into this, can't be scary.
Whose is it?
Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were licking your face?
I-no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.
Hello children!
Well that's not fair, you've already had some!
Oh no problem, maybe I'll play with my left hand.
Thanks.
So you kissed her, so what happened after that?
F-hah.... flennin....
So was I.
Morning.
Oh yes!
What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?
Hey!
I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.
Central Perk?
No, I guess I just never really cried. Y'know? I'm not a crying kind of guy.
Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard.
Well it couldn't have been worse. A woman literally passed through me. OK, so what is it, am I hideously unattractive?
Yes!! I love you! I can't even remember what we were fighting about!
Don't read my condoms!
Yuh-huh.
Hey, I hear what your saying, okay? And, thanks for the warning.
Okay.
Okay, I'm a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.
Ok, Phoebe.
Hell is filled with people like you.
Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat.
So, uh, you met someone, huh?
What?
Already?!
No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. Will you be my wife?
Hi! Bye!
There he is!
What? Oh this is excellent. You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller, the eyesore from the Liberace house of crap.
No!!
Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.
Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office?
Thanks.
April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. Well that's excellent.
And then Tineals.
Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke--Diet Coke.
No we didn't!
Nope, not under here!
All right.
No I didn't!
What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?
Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea. We might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon.
Thank you.
Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.
Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there?
That's true!
What a great apology! And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!
You think?
Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, I'm in.
Who said anything about Christmas?
But we don't do that.
I know I am.
We're the Bings.
Okay, come here! Come here.
All right buddy, way to go!
But then later that night...
Can I give you a present now?
Okay.
So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!
Yeah, it's a very large plane.
You've got it.
What are you crazy? That's a baby!
Hi, oh hi.
Hey! Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!!
Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.
No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!
Yeah.
I knew it!
What?!
What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. Y'know some might find it amusing, I myself find it regular.
Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.
Alright look Ross I'll give you 50 dollars for your underpants.
Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about.
Okay, so, I'm in Las Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli-
I don't think so.
Okay. Good one.
So he has to be a male who has at least $50.
I don't know. I can't--I just, I can't get her out of my head. Y'know? I mean, I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person. I'm a horrible person. No you're not Chandler! We still love you Chandler!
Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.
Yes!
Okay!
I can see why that's hard to resist.
Oh yeah.
He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady.
Huh.
That's a good idea. I wonder where I could get a basket of porn...
You know, it's... something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back.
How did you? How? How?
Hey.
What?!
Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?
Nothing.
What? That's terrible!
They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?
Please, don't take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!
Well, I-I still think you're very-very nice and very pretty...
I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay.
Pheebs! Always a pleasure.
Oh my God.
Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget. Seriously, good luck marrying me.
Hey, look, Phoebe I wanted to meet her in person too, okay, but she's married, she has a husband.
Really?
Oh no no no no, no no no no no no, you see, what I had planned shouldn't take more that 2, 3 minutes tops.
I don't care, she slept with me.
Well that's a full cup!
Why don't you use ours across the hall, 'cause she...has...problems.
Yeah.
Okay.
Tyrannosaurus!
I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship. Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives.
About what?
Ross is wearing leather pants! Does nobody else see that Ross is wearing leather pants? Someone comment on the pants!
Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!
Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's fast!
Could I play?
Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?
You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!
Okay, listen, how far am I gonna have to go with her?
Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!
Oh, I'm going on the lamb.
Good luck!
Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!
Now, there's two reasons.
And, a lemon lime.
Uh-oh.
Then why didn't you tell me to do that?!!
Here you go Joe, here's the freshly squeezed orange juice you asked for.
Oh Maria. You can't say no to her, she's like this lycra spandex covered gym...treat.
Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!
Well this is great! I'll give you a call! We should do it again sometime!
Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor.
Don't worry about it. I'm taking care of it tonight.
I'm not arguing with that.
Y'know when I said that because we're getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets?
Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we'd do nothing.
Noo!
Why are you screaming and hugging?
Oh uh, when?
Okay, so you both just know this stuff?
Let's have Monica decide.
Oh, yeah, he's my... he's my best friend.
Is that what you're thinking about right now?
Yes, I realise that.
I'm not in a meeting. I'm right... Whoops.
I'm not yanking you.
I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
Oh, hello Rachel.
Hi, Paul, is it?
Oh, ok, 'cause we never do that.
I-I can't believe Jill's gone. I can't help it, I opened a gate.
Are you serious?
Run, Joey! Run for your life!
Well, you owe me one, big guy.
No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish.
See you later.
Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I don't do porn.
Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very aware of my tongue...
What are you talking about?
Any contact?
GET OUT NOW!!
That's great.
What?
Sorry!
Huh! Where is the dog?!
Yes, please don't spoil all this fun.
You see what I mean.
I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic...
I know.
The spoon. You licked and-and you put. You licked and you put.
Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie's made some new friends.
Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?
Hey, Lowell.
People do stupid things when they're upset.
Well yeah, but then...
Because I'm in love with Monica!!
Yeah, for about 30 minutes.
Hey!
How could it not matter?!
Hey!
Ok, but can you tell him that, because he thinks he's too pink.
You mean a three pointer?
We can't do that that's insane. I mean 'A' he could wake up and 'B' y'know, let's go for it.
Really.
Well then maybe you shouldn't go.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it just seems that Robert isn't as concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped.
...Take off their hats!
Pete Becker. Pete... Is this him?
And twenty-five it is.
Too dry.
Pheebs?
So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.
Why would the baby creep me out?
Yeah!
Okay to come in?
I wanna quit the bank!
No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you'd have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Y'know it's hard enough to be fourteen. You're skinny. You're wearing speedoes-That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and there's your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!
Hey man, look it's my best bud. How ya doin? Wow, you are really gettin' good at that Marcel Marceau thing. Hey, whaddya say uh, we play some ball, you and me, huh, whaddya say? OK, that's my bad.
Well, I-I just didn't think it was funny sir.
So you knew we were gonna miss the movie!
Oh, this is soo bad.
Joey! Joey!!
Batman has the Batmobile!
That, that's what's stupid.
Thanks, I'm glad you see it that way.
Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller!
No!
That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight. Maybe there's something in that area.
Hey.
It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.
A woman's
Ahhhh.
Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm.
Yeah, listen, Joey isn't gonna be here tonight so why don't you come over and I'll let you uh, feel my bicep. Or maybe more.
Hey!
I want you out.
Drop off my dry cleaning. Pick up my vitamins. Teach me how to spell vitamins. Wear in my new jeans.
Morning, Ross.
This is terrible. What am I going to do?
No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Well, I-I guess I gotta go.
Really?
Oh-no, he's right.
OK, I'm gonna get some more coffee before the pinching and eye-poking begins.
Ohh!
Yeah, right, yeah, I guess so.
It's throwing and catching!
Okay, absolutely!
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah, he's made phone calls, written letters, he even came to New York, but I always said I was too busy to see him. Y'know it's all very Cats in the Cradle-I don't want to get into it. Here we go.
You can't wear that! I'm wearing the famous tux! James Bond's tux!
You ready?
It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
Ah, I fooled around with Joey's sister. Well, that's not the worst part.
Well, there you go.
He started mine first!
We actually missed it.
Sure I would!
Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'
Games and stuff.
No, I don't want to tell anybody else because I don't want Monica to find out.
Hey.
Hey, do you want this done quick, or do you want this done right?
Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Y'know? And it turns out I was wrong. And now it's lodged in my throat.
Is that a swing?
Two. This photographer, who seemed really dull. And this actor guy, who I'm not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone 'Chandler Bing,' he said 'Whoa-whoa, short message.'
Now I've upset you? What did I say?
Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen .
Honey, you did call him back. 'Cause, it's, it's really old.
Crazy bitch.
Y'know that wasn't part of it?
I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr. Peanut than Mr. Salty.
And that's how you bought it?
Where did you hear it from before?
How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago?
Dude, don't do that too me!
Well, you're gonna.
You're right, I'm sorry. "Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..."
No! No! No! I can't do that!
Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing. Hey Mr. Douglas.
It doesn't matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?
But I do know that it's some time tomorrow.
I majored in lightning rounds. All right, we're gonna destroy you.
You can say that because she's not your mom.
Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us.
You put your fist through the wall?
Oh yeah.
Forget it, that's off.
Stunning entertainment center. Fine, fine Italian craftsmanship.
You're gonna be carrying their baby and give them a Sony Play Station?
No!
Oh my God! Play!
Yeah, that's her.
Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie?
Yes, and we call Ross Lingers In The Bathroom.
Yeah, well, don't expect that to happen anytime soon!
I so am.
What?
You don't know?
And that's the only colour that comes in.
Look out kids, he's coming!
Really?
No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.
Oh hey, how'd the interview go?
Maybe we'll have to listen and see!
Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.
You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great! Ahhh!
I can't believe this.
Look at her go! She must love me more than I love her! What's wrong with me? Ooh, don't open that door.
So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!
Hey, you know what, here's a thought. Why don't you stay home from work today and just hang out with me.
Come on, you're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.
Well, it's, it's yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it?
So, what are you gonna do?
Umm?
You bitch.
Oh, they're a hoot.
You are so great! I love you!
Hey!
Jeez, man did you fall.. Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?
I'm sorry. You're not easy-going, but you're passionate, and that's good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that I'm pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that's good too. So, they can say that you're high maintenance, but it's okay, because I like ... maintaining you.
I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish...
Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!
Why did you look at me when you said that?
Hey!
You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?
How do Monica and Phoebe know?
I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you lived with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to bed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!
You're kidding, no!
Hey! Well, I've been preparing for that my entire life! Or something about you that's mean!
Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?
Sounds great.
Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?
Oh, I am no women, but that is one tasty dish.
Yeah. So do we need to hug here or. . .
Well, I feel like a snack!
Okay.
Where's my seat belt?
Not yet.
No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.
You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college, Ross used to wear leg warmers!
Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.
You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?
Yeah, I'm gonna stick with the ring. Oh, this one's nice! I like this one! Sir? Uh, kind sir? Can I see this one?
Young! You're a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybody's ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!
Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.
So ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?!
I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let's just get that thing...pushed back in.
Wax the door shut, we're never leaving, ever.
Ahh, Gepeto, $5,000 dollars? Are you insane?
Morning.
How can you not be wearing any underwear?
And I love the milk! But, I'm not gonna some British girl to move in with me! Joey, you say things now.
I think you played the Gunther card too soon.
Cookie?
Stop making candy!
No! No! No! I was so careful!
Whoa, whoa, prom night flashback.
I am totally picturing you with all those women!
Hey, look, you're in trouble either way! Okay? If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she's gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go.
I'm not mad.
Because if I go home, we're gonna become the Bings! I can't be the Bings!
Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane?
I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
Ah that's a cantelope.
Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game.
Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.
Ho! Ho! Ho!
Ross, ten o'clock.
Sorry. I'm sorry. Y'know what, we're just gonna throw it.
Well, you're not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?
Aah, y'killing me!
I KNEW IT!!!!
Forget it! Okay, I'm not giving up the apartment.
Hey, Ben, remember us? Ok, the mole came off.
Hannibal Lecter...better roommate than you.
Ok, that's Eric.
You remember Janice.
I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.
You don't think I get up when you get up?
No-no-no-no, this is bad! It's bad! This is bad!
I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride.
I'm full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, I'll regret it.
Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning. We're not working out, it's over.
Well, that's pretty much all I'm looking for from these people.
Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It's the oldest game!
Hey. Do you want this scone? It came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you!
Yeah you are!!
Yep! From now on its gonna be the four of you guys and me and the misses. The little woman. The wife. The old ball and chain.
What?!
The abridgment.
No!
What a minute, I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat! They did experiments on me! I can't have children!!
OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on that. Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a hundred times, I promise I will never take it off my. . . wrist. But if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just uh, you stay in there.
Oh.
Oh, just hanging out, talkin' about uh, websites. Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.
Oh, do you not want to?
Alright, alright, but you better be wearing clothes when I open my eyes.
What?
Hey, no, I've never been lower or wetter. I'll be fine. I'll just turn your, uh, bedroom into a game room or somethin', you know, put the foosball table in there.
Hang on buddy!
Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
Wow, you look...
Damn Rollos!
We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.
Yeah!
Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby?
Are you serious?
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?
There you go!
Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!
Okay.
Thank you for that! I was not flirting.
I'm gonna grab you some tissue.
Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.
Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I've missed the last 1200 times.
Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?
Because that would be crazy?
Where are they? Where are they?
Y'know what? It's gonna be okay. Y'know what? She's probably not gonna even want to come.
Hey.
Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?
Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.
It must take you forever to find your keys.
Yes, but if it's any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it.
Okay.
What's going on?
Because, you know, you don't have to. If you want, you could just take a nap right here.
Yes, yes I actually saw him leave. I mean that guy is standing in the window holding a human head. He is STANDING IN THE WINDOW HOLDING A HUMAN HEAD!
No, no, no. No-no-no.
Hi.
Maybe we should give them some privacy.
Hey!
What are you doing?
Call.
No, I don't even think he knew. Hey, would you sleep with somebody to get a great job?
Yeah!
Yeah, me either.
You are gonna be a huge star! I'm gonna hug ya!
Hey! Hey, hey-hey, hey.
Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y'know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!
Op, op, I'm convinced!
What?
Yeah!
He's right. Nobody's gonna benefit, and you're just gonna hurt her.
Sure. What's up?
No you can't.
All right, Janice, likes him. In fact she likes him so much she put him on her freebie list.
Oh, y'know, y'know what Pheebs?
Oh come on you big faker!
Nooo.
I'm marrying her.
You know what, okay, fine. Don't get up, you just sit right there. I just hope, you don't mind, you know, my hand right here. Op, not touching, can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad!
Oh they didn't want to come!
Wellll?
Gap commercial. So did you book them? Did you call?
Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.
Ohhh!
I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.
To Monica!
It's gotta be the first one.
And condoms are the way to do that?
Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you...
It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.
Not exactly. . . I'm wearin panties.
Okay, a quick one. Come on hug it out. Oh hey! There you go. Okay.
Okay, bye!
Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.
Hey!
Look, I just don't think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Y'know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. Y'know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?
Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot more interesting.
Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!
BEND OVER?!!!
Yeah, I'd love to but I've tried that so many times they won't even let me in the store anymore.
Okay, a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I can't get in!
Yeah baby!
Uh why, do you have a lecture?
All this lying has been hard on us too.
So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?
My friend's name is Joey.
Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.
Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!
Oh yeah, totally!
No, no. It-it's not about the swearing, it's more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.
Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?
How do you do that?
Well, I'm upset-for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.
Okay.
Might wanna try Joseph.
Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly you're having sex with him.
I figured I'd buy those. Pat, I'd like to buy a vow.
Bye.
Yes... thank you. That was... that was....
Yeah, I know. She makes me happy.
Look you have to realize I don't think of you as a thin, beautiful woman. See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is you're Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica.
Excuse me?
Wow, you're, you're right. I have a horrible, horrible name.
Hey, look at this! They're lighting the big Christmas tree tonight.
OK, now wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen.
Well, I think it's very brave what you said.
What?
Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it.
No you don't! No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorce another chance.
Oh, no, no. Nina... ..she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all.
No. When it comes to sweets, he's surprisingly strict.
Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big
Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?
Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.
Please?
Dangerous Liaisons.
Well you don't have to sound so surprised.
Huh-huh! You can't give her that.
Oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom.
No Joey! No Joey! Don't Joey! Joey!
Okay, so that's it, everybody knows! It's official, we're moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?
Goin' out, huh? Wow! Wow! So things didn't work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.
I'll see you guys later, I gotta go...do a thing.
Not once!
Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves winking.
Yeah, she's dying... Of a cough apparently.
I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y'know he's the botanist.
What? What?
Woah, woah, I've put on a little weight?
Well is she...
Well it's not flexed right now!
What about all that "friends forever" stuff?
Surprise!!
I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.
Oh-oh-hey!
Oh-ho, come here. Listen, you are one of my favourite people and the most beautiful woman I've ever known in real life.
No, no no no. You'll be fine. Hillary's bind, right?
So when you said, "Get up early," did you mean 1986?
Oh, you get used to it.
Oh my... God?
Okay.
She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.
So, is Janine around?
And was the curse lifted?
Here goes.
Why not?!
Hello.
Oh hey, it's, it's terriffic. I mean it's a regular space... fest.
I confronted her, and she didn't deny it! I don't live here!
Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.
Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!
Yes, yes, we had the sex.
We're doomed. Okay, they're gonna take 50 bucks out of our accounts for the rest of our lives. What are we gonna do?
Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked , or, or a big tub of jam.
No. All right, y'know what, she's gonna think that I'm handing you a credit card, but what I'm really gonna do is hand you a library card.
You just said... Of course you're my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though?
Did you not hear me say, "Du-ude?!"
Is there any chance you didn't see that?
Really?
Look, I'm sorry! But there's nothing I can do, I think I'm in love with her!
Ok, there is one more way to say it, who knows it?
All right!
What?!
Heyyyy-What?
Come on in.
Its Phoebe! Hi!
Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere.
Well hello!
If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?
You have no trouble telling time now right?
Look, Monica...
Together.
I'm not breaking up with her!
Oh, tell her good luck with that.
Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.
Hey.
Ohh, that's a good one.
Okay, I don't sound like that. That is so not true.
Yeah okay, I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them I mean, is it okay if they come visit?
Hey.
Hey, how's the first day goin'?
Where's Monica?
Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?
Hey, look, what do you want from me?
You're a genius!
Oh since forever! I used to go all over town listening to bands!
Okay, here is the phone bill.
Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in...vegetables, Joey?
Hey, gorgeous.
Yeahhh. I'm tellin' ya something, that ah, first smoke after nap time....
Three!
Well, Monica and Chandler can't go. We're going to dinner remember?!
We're in a relationship?
Yes, every single one of them.
Okay, umm, we all have to play strip poker.
Because sometimes, Phoebe after you sleep with someone, you have to kill the fish.
Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian life partner?
So, uh, how was he?
Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles.
Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!!
Hey, why don't you wear those earrings I gave you?
Look, you don't have to draw an actual wo-whoa! She's hot!
We don't know what could make this go away.
Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore...
Did you see Betty?
Well, what's the deal with these? These-these look nice.
Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!
Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about.
Double it!
What do you want from me, I've never met the guy. So anyway, Rachel, I'm sorry you can't stay, but the rest of us have a lot of work to do. What are you doing? All right, listen, I've got to wake up!
Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that's because I didn't send him an invitation.
Hey Ross, look what I've got going here.
F-hah.... flennin....
Well yeah! But now that I know that you're having these thoughts, I'm back to panic, anxiety, and uh I'm definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink.
Sydney Portier? Hehheh.
Ah, I don't know, you tell me. Anything you ah, wanna tell me, because, if you ah, you should, if you, you would, tell me.
Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.
I dunno what it is, it just doesn't quite feel like Christmas to me.
All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open.
I was looking forward to playing basketball, but I guess that's out the window.
Okay.
Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!
No.
Really?! That's what you heard? You said that?
That's awesome! That's great! What made you do it?!
WENUS. Weekly Estimated Net...
Why can't we talk in here? With, with, witnesses.
If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I'll be Crazy Man with a Snake, yknow. Crazy Snake Man. And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. "Run away from Crazy Snake Man," they'll shout!
So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?
Authorization? I don't need that. I'm gonna put everything back.
Okay, bye!
Water! Water! Water!
What've you been up to?
Great! Now, the score is 7 to almost 7.
Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a copier. Look, if there was anything I could do, I would do it. Okay? But everybody's allowed one mistake, right?
And we're done with the chicken fried rice.
What?
Oh, are we playing this?!
Do you think that there's a town in Missouri or some place called Sample? And ah, as you're driving into town there's-there's like a sign, and it says "You're in Sample."
No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when Snoopy falls. . . funny.
Congratulations!
Ehh.
Before!!
I'd like to toast, Ross and Emily. Of course, my big toast will be tomorrow at the wedding, so this is kind of my little toast or Melba toast, if you will. Okay. I known Ross for a long time. In fact, I knew him when he was going out with his first girlfriend. And I thought things were going to work out for him.. Until the day he over inflated her. Ohh, Dear God..
So uhh, how's the palace?
You're welcome.
Weird world. Your kids?
Scared? Happy?
Yeah, we got, um-hmm.
Bullies, big bullies.
We have free porn here!!!
No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth. Eh-uh-are you okay?
Hey! How'd it go?
Ooh! Ahh, Pheebs, was gonna tell a story.
Not like that, I won't! Kip would have liked the birds!
But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.
We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.
What?
Well, you still havent taken down the Christmas lights.
Give me it!
Okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag.
Happy plane-aversary.
I'm a little busy here Paul.
Yeah, you wish.
Okay. Okay. Yes honey, I made it myself. I can't do it. I can't do it. Oh! Oh! A mixed tape! A mixed tape!!
Elizabeth Hornswoggle?
Secret? Married people aren't supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.
Janice?
Well maybe there is one thing you can do.
Honey, it is not a date! I haven't talked to her in ten years! You can't just call up somebody you haven't talked to in ten years and ask them for a favor. There are rules, y'know? You gotta, you got to put in some time.
Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they're very hot.
Work people? Nobody told me.
Oh, no I don't.
So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?
Ye-e-es!!
And we're changing.
Hey! Honey, can I ask you a question about the Valentine's Day gifts?
Stay back, I've got kiwi. Run, Joey, Run!
Oh-oh.
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
OK, so at this point, the dealer...
And I just want a million dollars!
That's not a state Joe.
No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.
THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!
Yes, but I-I uh, don't have too.
Okay!
And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the Netherlands, right?
Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk....
No, ten o'clock.
Oh it's uh, over there on the table.
Nothing, except tell you, uh, I think it's wonderful how much energy you have.
Y'know, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know you're up there every night, you're naked, touching, kissing.
Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we can't leave in the small apartment after we've lived here! Didn't you ever read Flowers for Algernon?
Yes that was mine.
Oh no-no-no. This is amazing.
I know. Can you believe it? One year ago today I was just your annoying friend Chandler.
I'm out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?
Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.
Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio
What a wank!
Okay! Okay! Okay!
Hey.
Oh well, that makes it not terrible.
Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didn't I wouldn't have a shot?
Nah, Monica's watching some cooking show. Come on, I don't want to miss when they were skinny.
I know.
Oh yes, and that's what I want a roommate that I can walk around with and be referred to as the funny one.
Wouldn't it be easier if we just moved?
Why can't you tell her?
Can I just say one thing?
I don't know. It's a bracelet.
Oh Joey's got a really bad hernia, but that's nothing a little laser eye surgery won't fix!
No, I'm not!
And those guys were this close to lettin' us play this time too.
Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.
One nation, under God. Indivisible with liberty and justice for all. I remembered it. The champagne is here.
Gunther, can I get another cup of coffee, please? So uh, what do you do when you're not working here?
Okay, Ross is in the bathroom.
You're not a dad. You're not a dad.
Hey, you guys all know what you want to do.
Yeah, you're right about that.
You hear that! That is her chose, mister I'll let you have her! I win! You suck! I rule all! A mini-wave in celebration of me!!
You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?
Can I check out what she did to my room?
Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? All I said was that uh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, he should've pushed me off of the bridge.
Oh No, It's Terrific, It'S- It'S- Y'Know, You Deserve This, After All Your Years Of Struggling, You'Ve Finally Been Able To Crack Your Way Into Show Business.
Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.
Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.
You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.
Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.
Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.
Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
That's what's weird? Joey, the man's been captain of a cereal for the last 40 years.
It was the ring!
All right.
Jeez, relax! It's not like we're mar-ah-ah!!
Bye-bye.
Well, then, I might as well offer to stay.
I've had a very long, hard day.
Well, I am drinking lots of cups of coffee because I'm exhausted! Because Joey started snoring!
I said, "Geez, relax Monnnnn."
Y'know what? I can't believe this! Do you know what you did? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!
I'd be sad sure, but I wouldn't cry.
Maybe he's calling to say your obsessive and crazy.
Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.
Yeah! Why don't you stick around. You can sit right there.
At least as long as I have the pants.
You mean there's more than one of us.
But the Kit-Kats are all right?!
I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'
Sorry!
Hey!
Uhh, you've had a lot of sex right?
Do you have to be a Century 21 real-estate agent to get to wear those really cool jackets?
Uh-huh.
Hello.
I've got canned goods.
Uhh, no.
You can call off the roommate search! Hi! I'll be living here.
Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.
I wanna quit the gym.
No-no, why don't you hang on to that one.
Well I, I think we'd remember something like that.
Do either of you have the keys?
No, I'm afraid I won't be able to make love as well as him.
Please, please, please, don't be mad at me.
You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection. 'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no, no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself.
You told him to play the boxer gay!!
I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice.
Toootal chick-flick.
It doesn't scare me!
Okay.
I can't believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!
Okay, what is in here? Rocks?
I can't believe you came back.
Well, I... I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know.
Exactly.
That's-that's my nubbin.
Paid your phone bill?
Yeah, I'm not sure I can do that.
Well I've-I've never done that with you before.
Alright, one of you give me your underpants.
Okay.
Seriously?
Dying people say the craziest things.
Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbianI don't think we need a third...
I'll hold you close in my arms. I can't resist your charms. And love....
Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
That's great!
Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.
Well, uh, Dr. Greene, where are you going?
Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!
Yes! You mean the world the world to me. Oh...
Two hours, that lasted!
Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you.
Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!
...And what did you bring?
Okay.
I'd love it if you would do it.
Wait, wait! Wh-what are you doing here?
Hey.
What did you just do?
I know.
Yes! I've-I've never seen a roll like this in my life!
Oh that's too bad.
It's okay, I want this to be your night too. To Monica.
Oh.
You don't want to be guys, you'd be all hairy and wouldn't live as long.
Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.
Joe?
Okay.
...Quality, right, great.
So did Monica tell you about this great band called the Swing Kings that we're trying to get to play at the wedding?
I will have one.
Did she call?
Unbelievable
What's up with the simian?
Phoebe, it's me. You can tell me anything.
Oh yeah, I totally agree.
He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.
Look, forget it. We tried, but Phase Three is a lost cause, Okay? Those strippers were insanely hot, and I couldn't picture myself with any of them.
Ross-Joey, Joey-Ross.
Okay, on three. One....Two....
Okay, let's play my game now.
All right! Ten buck! Fork it over! Cough it up! Pay the piper! Gimme it.
Wait a minute, I can't give this to her.
Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?
Hey I didn't kill your fish. Look Eddie... Would you look at what I'm doin' here. That can't be smart. So we're just gonna take this guy right off ya and put him here in Mr. Pocket. Tangellon?
What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the... OK, OK, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table.
Okay.
Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why women won't look at me.
I think somebody has a crush on somebody.
No, no, no.
All right! Bring it on, you...
Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and...
I'm sorry, I guess I just like the pulp.
Okay, don't say anything, you might scare it away.
Really?
Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women.
Ohhh-hoo, funny story!
My diary! My diary, that's brilliant. I should have told her it was my diary, she never would have made me read her my diary.
Hmm.
Yes, but there's two in martini, soo everybody back to my office.
There I am!
OK.
Oh, so you're already doing your part for the kids.
Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no waiting.
If can invade Poland, there isn't anything I can't do.
Yeah, I'm sorry man.
Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room.
See, you think it's just a pen, but then you turn it over and it's also a clock.
Well, where's the logic in that?!
Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.
Well, I've got a girl in here.
Do we have to make the entire thing?
Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window.
The one time they're not home.
No, no, no, actually losers rhyme.
Almost over man.
Now, there is a dress laid out on your bed. Okay, you're doing great. You're doing great. You're doing fine.
Coffee house?
They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.
I can't do that.
Ross, don't. Ross!
They got a phone in there, right?
Oh, okay, time's up!
Happy birthday, pal!
Oh! It's on! It's on!
Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?
So, this isn't over?
I don't know. I can't tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly.
If it helps, I could slide over.
Hey.
Eddie, do you remember yesterday?
I got the time to get to know Julie.
So you're really okay with this?
So you might say, it's a magic ring.
Is it on?
Yeah?
So take care.
Ok, so let me just get this straight. So we're uh, strictly talking about the middle?
I just get mad when Rachel doesn't remember where we're going.
No he's, he's alright, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room.
Okay, could you just stop talking for a second? Yemen. That's right, yes, I'm being transferred to Yemen!
Nice try.
Well, I suppose I'd have to say you!! But, what if we're watching a movie in here?
Hey, that was really good!
You pick one.
Ooh, I do! I do! I do!
No, just the months you actually want to live here.
Okay, then get the lobster!
Atlantic City!
Uh, Yes. Yes. Ive just been going over your data here, and little thing, youve been post-dating your Friday numbers.
You betcha!
The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
Oh, y'know-y'know what, I was looking at it upside down.
But we're not ready to tell yet!
You mind if I...
Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.

Are we in London?
Yeah, I'm not so worried.
Hi.
Okay.
Phil.
Ross.
Okay.
Okay. Here's a question you never have to ask. My dad just called and wanted to know if he could borrow one of your pearl necklaces.
Well, y'know I'm 29. I mean who needs a savings account.
Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.
Hey Phoebs, can I have the milk after you?
No thanks, Josephine.
Leave me alone! For the love of God, leave me alone!!!
Y'know what, pretty good.
Hi!
Could I be more sorry.
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You're not talking about Chuckles University?!
What about him?
That's great, but shouldn't you be on the toilet right now?
Okay. I wanna quit the gym.
Boy did we make friends with the wrong sister!
Seven times!
All right, there's a nuclear holocaust, I'm the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
So?!
Your pants!
Uh, Julie.
Alright. "It was summer, and it was hot. Rachel was there. A lonely gray couch. 'Oh, look,' cried Ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. The end."
Oh, that's OK, we'll figure something out.
Okay.
Joey, no means no!
She's not as pretty as she was when she was 29.
The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me.
Why?
Can I use your phone?
Okay, give me a second! Did you clean up in here?
Well, thanks. I grow it myself. Y'know who also has great hair is Joey!
Hi.
Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it.
I'm gonna do it tomorrow y'know, and-and surprise her, but now you've ruined it!
For the last time no! Get out! Get out, Joey!
Okay, but after that, we're shootin' some pool.
See? Now, that's why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.
See, this is the brilliance of the show. I say always keep them running. All the time, running. Run. Run Yasmine, run like the wind.
Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, they can meet Krog!
No!
Look Eddie, aren't you forgetting anything?
Oh just great. He beeps me now with codes. One is, "Bring me food." Two is, "I'm with a girl, bring us food." Three is, "I'm lost and I can't find food."
To the left, to the left- aww!
Okay, okay, a little announcement, I just want everyone to know that the position of my best man is still open! And uh, so is the position of the bride.
I don't have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!
Well, I'm, I'm sorry... Ahhh. Have we met?
Yes, we do. But, we have to change first.
Alright, what have we learned so far?
Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.
ahem... um... Crystal duck.
8. 8!
All right, we haven't had sex yet. Okay, what's the big deal? Y'know? This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to the next level.
Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh, barks into the night. Well, who doesn't love dogs? Ah, he's a tap dancer! Yes, some would say that is a lost art. He's a pimp! There you go! Yes, he's a pimp. He's a big, tap dancing pimp! Hello?
Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.

It happened in London.
You mean like for award shows?
Okay, okay, here she comes! How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesn't want to get married?
So do I.
That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!
Yeah, Jell-o just like Mom used to make.
Oh, yeah... yeah.
Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.
It was working until you showed up, you big tree! I mean, this isn't fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other! And this is all just been one stupid mistake! I was gonna propose tonight.
I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.
Rach...
Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
Oh, that's fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts.
Hey. Well, you will all be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow night. This woman, Alison, from work. She's great. She's pretty, she's smart. And uh, I've been holding off on asking her out in the past, because she has an unusually large head. But, I'm not gonna let that stuff hang me up anymore. Look at me. I'm growing.
I just wan't to...
Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.
All right. Very good.
Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right!
What?!
And?
The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?
Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!
And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.
Yeah!
Did you make it, or are you just serving it?
Score.
Oh that's great!
No?
We can't tell him, you can't go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff.
Joey!
What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?
Thanks.
Hey!
Yeah, I heard you and Rachel talking.
Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!
I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships.
Hey.
So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.
I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke!
Hey Pheebs!
Your sister Joan is crazy.
Oh no-no-no!
Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him.
Oh, all right.
All right, maybe I should call her.
You wanna share it?
Yeah, it's two guys in a ring, and the rules are "There are no rules."
And uh, Rachel, glad to have you back.
Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?
Would you give me one minute!! Please.
Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
You said no right?
You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting.
Don't try to sway her. I'm your only chance to have a baby. Okay, let's go.
You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross did? He stole my joke. You know what? I'm going to get a joke journal. Y'know? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.
Is this a service you're providing me?
I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.
Does for me.
Ohhhhh!
All right.
All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her, it's over.
Thanks man.
No, no he went for a walk.
Okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!
Shhh, busy beaming with pride.
The man's got a point.
Well, it still has to go, right?
I don't care! I don't care!!
Yeah.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, you don't like the guy Rachel's dating? Well, that's odd.
All right listen, I have to go to the bathroom, but if the place with the big fish comes up again. I'd like know whether that's several big fish or just one big fish.
Well, uh, why don't you ask him yourself. Joey, this is my new roommate Eddie.
That was pretty intense huh?
Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I get to have sex with the star of the play!
I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.
Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. I got her machine.
You have to pick your moments.
Hey, whoa-whoa! What's she like?
Yeah, well, sorry doesn't bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home! I hate this stupid day! And everything about it! I'll see you later.
Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.
Oh, you're-you're going?
You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?
It's an old key!
Yeah.
Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store we've been too and I can't find the perfect ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! It's a beautiful selection.
Our baby.
Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.
So how'd it go?
I'm still on London time, does that count?
Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?
Jeez, what a baby.
OK, then, eat me, I'm done.
No-no-no-no, no, it's a good thing. Why must we dial so speedily anyway? Why must we rush through life? Why can't we savor the precious moments? Those are some huge breasts you have.
Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!
Okay.
I'll be right with you.
One. . . two. . . two and a half. OK, just show me one of them.
Thank you Gunther, put it there. Definitely not easier with coins. Thank you.
Do you know me or are you just really good at this game?
Maybe it was his sister's. You know, maybe it was his daughter's.
Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.
Okay, well he totally screwed up the punch line. Y'know, it's supposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh.
Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy.
Oh, right, well yeah, I graduated fourth grade and realized I wasn't a pimp.
Guys?
It is?
Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.
Look man!
Oh, I'm taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer.
