No, no, no, wait! Okay, okay. Don't! I'll go, I'll go!
Unbelievable.
Well, I assume I'll have to take showers with him, but y'know, that's true of any job.
Then how come it is?
Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?!
Impressive.
Ohh, so no sign of Emily huh?
Well...
Yes I did! And I put a little Post-It on it that said, "Must go out today," and underlined today three times and, and then I put a little heart in the corner because I didn't want to seem to bossy.
Goodbye, baby.
Oh.
Yes! Hell yes!
Ohhh!!!
Oh look! A letter from my mom.
Well why didn't you take the job?
Oh, come on, would you just grab my ass.
I'm not vanilla! I've done lots of crazy things! I mean I got-I got drunk and married in Vegas!
NO!
Well, y'know, a little of this, a little of that. Got myself a date tomorrow night.
Okay.
Monica!!!
That is so unfair.
Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!
Well, who wouldn't?!
Yes.
Hi.
Oops. Sorry! Well, good thing you number all of them, huh?
Yeah and I'm a horrible, horrible person.
Okay Phoebe calm down, there's no need to place blame. Okay? I warned her about those candles.
Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience!
A birthday party.
All right, okay, look, what if you could keep the apartment and get the tickets?
Hey, y'know what? You're the one who wants to make this big change and move in with Chandler! You should be the one to go! Why should I have to leave?!
Ooh, I was soo nervous about that letter. But the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you've grown. Y'know?
Uh-huh.
Hey!
So what happens next?
Yeah, we're, we're actually just gonna walk 'cause it's right up there at the Angelica.
Over here!
Oh, I'm sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone else?
Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it doesn't come together?
Oh right.
Hey look-look, Phoebe's talking to uh, Cute Coffeehouse Guy.
Pardon?
Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.
Yeah, right, he almost danced me right down that...garbage chute.
Okay.
No that could kill her.
With Ross and Jill?
Okay.
You think?!
Because, I wanted to hurt you.
Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.
Well, we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys used for catering and we realised...
Of course they're listening to you! Everybody listens to you.
Melissa!
That's fine. So Monica, you are now in control of my love life.
The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!
No no no no.
Yeah, love. It's a tricky business isn't it?
So Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
Hi!
Oh.
Hey Pheebs, you're still alive! How are you doing?
Uh-huh, go on.
What-wh-what so we'll just stay married forever?!
And that's Phoebe , and that's Joey.
Oh, somebody will.
Wow, he must like you the best.
That was amazing. I can't even send back soup.
Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about you...
Ooh! Y'know what? If we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour.
I-I don't want your job. I-I don't. Ohh this is such a mistake. I did not make out with him. Nobody made out with him. I did not use my keycard yesterday. I don't even know how to use my keycard.
Oh oh oh, wait! You only got whipped cream in there! Ya gotta take a bite with all the layers!
Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!
Hello.
So, um, did she...
Thank you. Oww!!!! God!
All right, we were shaking hands and he kinda leaned toward me... Y'know maybe he was going to open the door, but I totally miss read him and I uhhh...
Oh honey, I'm so sorry, you were right, this feels great!
Why on earth would I understand this?
Uh Pheebs, we just actually kinda wanted to be alone.
Hey. Oh, I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of the other two guys to go out with, who would you pick?
So, if I wanna have my kid when I'm 35, I don't have to get pregnant until I'm 34. Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity clothes! Oh wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant...
Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
Oh, Ross...
I, I don't have it.
Phoebe!
I can't believe they've been together for three years.
Ah you went one too far. Uh, flowers or balloons?
Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room.
What?!
Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?
Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
That almost hit me in the face.
Well of those things that you said in the interview, I mean if you believe any of them, I must not be a very good assistant. Y'know what? I am just gonna pack up my desk, and I will be gone by the end of the day! Well, I guess there's no use to me sticking around 'til the end of the day!
Virgo?
Just give us our apartment back!
Ok.
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. They used to live here; sometimes they migrate back over.
Well honey, what about you?
Okay!
Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.
Oh, yeah! Yeah!
Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later.
And fifty. So it was like one and fifty dollars.
Okay.
How are ya?
Well, I'm sorry, I thought you needed them!
OK.
Okay.
No, no, thats OK. Y'know, I think I'm gonna give it a go.
Ohhhh, I cannot look at it!
Ankle.
Hey!
Yeah, sure. Umm, they didn't have poppy seed bagels, so I... Oh my word!
Guess!
Hey!
No! You gotta hold my hand!!
Yeah, I mean, you should play in public!
Ohh, okay, I'm sorry. You're right. Y'know what? We absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other. All right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what you're asking of me.
That is not true. She did! She forced me!
Yes!!!
That is it! You just barge in here, you don't knock
Uh, I don't know. Why don't you put it right here next to my water?
What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!
Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!
What-Pheebs?! Two dates in one day? That's so unlike you.
Close call day.
What?!
Yeah, ohh! Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth? I have a crush on you; I am attracted to you. Gee, I-I know that I freaked him out
Joey! Come on! I don't wanna make any mistakes, alright? This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like "Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?"
You have! Ross, you should give yourself credit. I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, "Once a cheater, always a cheater."
Ya think?
Okay. Okay, we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels great.
It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.
And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!
Well y'know if you, if you started smoking again you could've at least told me! Come on, give me one of those! What are we talking about?
And ya know what, now I've got closure.
Hey, Mom? Having fun?
So, is this just gonna be you and Carol?
And Mrs.?!
No! Sorry, I just thought you were somebody else. Hi!
Oh, please, Monica. You've always hated my lamp, and then, all of a sudden, it's just magically broken?
Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow.
I bet 20.
Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed.
Okay, hold on real quick, hold on a second let me just uh, get a little more comfortable here. Wait, now wait a second, this isn't too revealing is it?
Sp-spoil?
I don't know! I mean, we still care about each other. There's a history there. 'S'like you and Carol.
Yes, I realize that...
Oh, well, that shouldnt be so hard, now that youre dating. "Sweetheart, youre fired, but how bout a quickie before I go to work?"
Mon, Ethan called again. Mon?
Really?
Okay. Okay, great! Umm, okay, just turn around.
Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.
Yes, his name is Barry, he's a doctor, thank you very much.
So, like, you guys all have jobs?
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait.
Hey! Y'know what? You are in our apartment all the time! Okay? This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!
The ring from the cave, yeah.
Relaxi-Taxi!
Oh no, you're the best.
I know!
Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that I don't get.
No it's not!
Okay!
What is that noise?
Really? Mine too.
No. Joey, she knows! We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment and we saw them doing it through the window. Actually, we saw them doing it up against the window.
Ohh...
Oh.
How come you are?!
Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, let's do that Sailor Joe. Quick question though, what's this called?
I don't know... sometimes it doesn't.
Really? Oh thank you! Oh... Oh, would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug?
Its still there!
I-I-I didn't! I didn't! She thought you were cute.
I can't believe this is happening.
Insane!
Ahh!
Just washing the windshield.
Oh...
You have been maid of honor before?!!
Okay, okay, okay.
Hello? Like he was really gonna send you one? She was a big girl.
Ohh, I'm gonna have to get over it. God, see I didn't know that's I had to do, I just have to get over it.
What?!
Wow!!
Oh my gosh, wow. Monica. Oh my god. Mom. This is so great.
You all know? Does Ross know?
Ross, I...
Nothing.
Oh.
So....
Hey!
Okay, okay, I checked. We have: Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Cinnamon Stick, Camomile, Mint Medley, Blackberry, and.. oh, wait, there's one more, um.. Lemon Soother. You're not the guy that asked for the tea, are you? Okay.
All right, fine.
Well, because she loves you and because you love her.
Hi! I just wanna--Ahhh!!! Oh my God! Oh my God!
I went really long.
Exactly.
Yeah, these are pretty ch-ching.
Let's go to lunch.
Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got all over head!
Oh-oh!
Hi sweetie!
Oh. That's so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, 'Where's number 27?!'
Really?
Thank you. So are we good?
Joey, you can't keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him.
Oh Monica come on, y'know I don't sleep with guys on the first date!
I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.
Oh, honey, please, no, I can't get started with all that Ross stuff again. I mean, he's gonna screwed up for a looong time. And besides y'know, I don't, I don't go for guys right after they get divorced.
Hi!
Well, okay, look. I don't know, listen, I don't know what's going on here but let's...
I bet you're a Gemini.
Honey, come on! You live far away! You're not related. You lift right out.
Phoebe's dead.
What? Oh, well then y'know what? I think Monica would be very interested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy.
And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down?
I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great.
Yeah.
Ahh....So...Wow...The spring line, it's really going to be great this year, huh?
Hi!
Hey! Umm, do you guys have any juice?
Well, Chandler, you're gonna have to tell him.
Huh-hoo, yeah, no, it's still basil.
Cupid.
Ahhh, I think you look great! That bag is gonna get you that part.
Honey, no one thinks you're a pansy, but we do think you need a tissue.
No Mon that's not the point. I'm out a thousand dollars, I'm all scratched up, and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand!
Yeah it is, it is. We really, really have to do something about that.
I'm just making margaritas.
Come on, show me.
Get out, get out of my apartment.
Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight. I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding.
Oh, oh, this is good, this is really good.
And did you?!
Huh.. How about 600?
Ra.... Er.. Barbra.
Um-hmm.
I can't let him go out that way, he's got a meeting. You've got something here on your back.
I got it!
This is Bonnie? This is Bonnie? You're Bonnie?
No, I know, they're from me. Look you guys this is not good. I mean we have enough trouble with guys stealing our wind without taking it from each other.
No, I-I live with Phoebe. I mean you're alone, alone. And I just-it's just not the time for us. I'm sorry.
Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?
I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too late.
No, you wait! This is ridiculous!
Oh, I don't know. I guess we have to eat.
Hmm.
Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!
I cannot believe I'm gonna meet Jessica Ashley!
Okay, y'know what? I'll-I'll have toast!
Uh, it's from yore. Like the days of yore. Y'know?
What's up, Ross?
No-no they do but, you just have to wait.
Okay!
Don't!! Honey, what are you doing here?!
Two, two babies?
Oh. Here's your moisturiser. Hi!
Well, I...
No.
Well this has story behind it! I mean they had to ship it all the way from the White Plains store.
Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex. "Was it good for you?"
What?
Ohhh!!!!
Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight. It's been kinda a long day.
No!!
Okay, calm down, here they are.
Yeah that works.
What is it?
Honey that sounds like fun.
Well and clearly not a minute sooner.
Oh, okay. Will you take my place?
Chandler!
Who is it?
What happened to uh, MEG.?
Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee.
Paul. Umm, I just wanted you to know that Ross really is a great guy.
No! So I can be by myself. Y'know? Have a little alone time.
Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a Celica.
No! Not at all!
Okay.
Look at that! Look at that! We all do it. Okay, I'm stopping now.
Well maybe he's just taking a nap.
Ross gave it to me.
Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, she's gonna get over this, y'know? I mean, so you said my name! Y'know you just said it 'cause you saw me there, if you'd have seen a circus freak, you would've said, "I take thee circus freak." Y'know, it didn't mean anything, it's just a mistake. It didn't mean anything. Right?
May fifth, why?
Phoebe?
Yeah, okay, I'll see you later.
Ow! Ow!
You do know that I will be here when he comes over.
Mom, would you relax. That was 10 blocks from here and, the, the woman was walking alone at night, I would never do that. Mom, c'mon, stop worrying. This is a safe street, this is a safe building, there's nothing OH MY GOOOD, oh my God, oh I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go. OK, that's fine, you just read the paper, I'm gonna get a pot, it's not for you. OK, that's fine, read the Family Circus, enjoy the gentle comedy. Aaahh, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, aaaaahh. It's open you guys.
Why? Is he? He is! Isn't he? He's dating that slut in marketing!
Well, uh, I-I don't know. See when-when you put it that way y'know it does sort of...
Okay.
Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor.
Ughhhh!! Forget it! This is, this is not how this is supposed to happen.
They're not true?
Just a job!
Right?
So how's it goin' with Joey?
What are you? Monica!! Stop it!! Oh my God! Stop it!
Wh?!
Okay.
Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.
Allison's birthday party.
No honey, okay, okay, you wanna know why Ross canceled the date? Because I asked him to.
No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-I-would you-actually, would you go check on that?
Hey!
Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?
Honey, we have to go. Our reservations are at 8:00.
Well, she-she ob-obviously saw the tire tracks that were leading up to the closed garage.
Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn't go with Mark?
Jill this is not about me being jealous of you! This is about you being a brat! Wanting what you can't have!
Well, they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is 'no tissue, no tuschy.' Well, if everybody's going.
Thank you. Thank you so much!
Would anybody like more coffee?
I will wake you up in a way that's proved very popular in the past.
I'm going commando, too.
Oh, can we read them?
Yeah well, I'm-I'm a slut.
Uh-huh.
Mindy.
Well, hello, Mr. Rachel!
Oh!!
She asked-asked you out again?
Bloomingdale's eliminated my department.
Oh my God!
Hey! Hey, cute jacket!
Hi!
Does anybody want anything else?
Well what if I told you, you can do it in my apartment?
Oh my goodness, she had the smoothest skin! I mean when I stuck that dollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thigh...
I know, I just didn't want to wear my glasses on my first date.
And you know Monica and Ross!
But you said that you liked him! I mean what happened?! Did ya just change your mind?!
Well, you know I'm not surprised. I mean have you seen them together, they're really cute.
Down at the docks again?
Ahh... Chandler's on the couch!!
Oh my god, I can't believe you let me put this in my mouth.
No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?
No!
Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My father's boat didn't make that much noise when it hit rocks!
Joey, is what she just said umm-Oh my God. You were actually gonna...
Okay come on Phoebe, it's nothing! Monica, come on!
Me?!
All right I know, I know how it looks Pheebs, but I'm telling you...
Oh, come on! I'll give you ten free Ralph Lauren shirts.
Five.
Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?
This is totally your fault!
Yeah me too.
Monica!
Well, you were pretty damn good.
Okay. Umm, what should we do for the theme?
I'm gonna do it too!
What? Why? Where are you?
Come on see, she doesn't look that bad.
Yeah.
Do you wanna play football?
I don't know. What do you mean last night? Nothing, nothing uh, happened last night.
Monica, what should I do?
Oh my God!! Great!
I tried! They won't take her back.
Oh, Monica! Would you stop being such a wuss?
Hi. Hey, hi! So uh, Frank and Alice wanted me to tell you that they're still outside making phone calls.
Nah, uh, uh, uh, uh.
Well, from me. And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite.
Oh. Oh!
Ok, doggie get the- aahhh. Ok go get the sandwich, get the sandwich doggie. Good doggie get the sandwich, get the...ok, Joey, the dog will lick himself but he will not touch your sandwich, what does that say?
Hey!
Any chance you think the couch looks good there?
Ok, I will have the uh, side salad.
This one?
No.
Okay. It's okay. We're gonna be okay. Y'know what? It's okay. I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna boil some water and just rip up some sheets!
I don't wanna hear "Three failed marriages!"
Oh-oh, Pottery Barn! You can throw the rest away.
That sounds great.
Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?
Ugh. Excuse me, could you give this to that guy over there? Go ahead. Thank you. Sorry. Okay, Las Vegas.
Who?
OK, here we go. Honey, I'm sorry, they were all out of apple pie, someone just got the last piece.
What?
Oh, stop that! Don't kid about that! Will all the stars be there?
I'm just visiting my good friend Carol.
You guys are unbelievable. No! He cannot come.
Well, sure! Come in! Well, what-what happened to your girlfriend?
Oh!
Thank you.
What?
Oh sure it is!
Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.
What handsome is not your type? Smart? Kind? Good kisser? What those things aren't on your list? Ross is a great guy! You would be lucky to be with him!
Oh, thank you that's very helpful, I'm glad you came over.
I think I just shipped 3,000 bras to personnel. Oh honey, I gotta go. Mark, I need you!
All right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating Bob!
That's funny.
Really?
And y'know what else, oh my God, are they gonna love you.
Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks? Spoiled?
Oh what do you know? Virgin!
Horrible and degrading list of reasons not to be with me?
Well now what's the rush?
Oh. Oh, right.
Hey!
Do you even understand what off the rack means?!
Hi! Are you ready? We're gonna be late!
Okay, gotta go! Wish me luck!
Yes, you're having a boy!
Bye!
There you go!
Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before. Only $98.50 to go.
Hey!
Well, people missed you in there. And in fact, there was actually a request for "Smelly Cat".
Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?
Oh!!
Uh-huh.
Anymore!!
No, it's been three nights in a row.
All right, you know what? I am not leaving here, until you call that plane back!!
You and your stupid fear. I hate your fear. I would like to take you and your fear....
Well of course we will help you decide! We will do anything we can to help you! Now, I would like to make a toast, to the future Mrs. Chandler Bing , my best friend, and truly one of the nicest people that...
No.
Oh God! Y'know what I wish? I wish you were six years older. Well actually, if I'm wishin' for stuff, I actually wish I was six years younger.
When I was um, 7, I crashed my bike right out in front of his house and to stop me from crying he kissed me right here.
Okay.
You're right, you're right. I should just tell her the truth.
Thank God. Food.
Ummmm.... well, actually I'm already done, but I...I kinda got plans.
'Gone for more jars. Back later. Monica Geller.'
I'll be right there! Okay, Ross, please come on! I thought we have moved on! I thought we've gotten to a place where we could be happy for each other! I mean was that just me?
Aw what are you?! A detective?
Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody who's had a baby. Like your mom?
Okay, listen, I'm thinking, why don't we just tell them who we really are? I mean, it'll be fine, I really think it'll be fine.
Hi, remember us?
Look Ross, if you're so freaked out, just get in the car!
No, you don't, Ross. Imagine the worst things you think about yourself. Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you.
All right listen umm, I just bought something I'm not sure she's gonna like it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that I wanted since I was a little girl.
The most unbelievable thing happened to me today.
I'm telling you it's like watching Bambi learn how to walk.
Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything.
It's kinda slutty.
...I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
Oh no, at the Grammies I always win.
: So basically, you get your ya-yas by taking money from all of your friends.
To get you to make out with him!!!
Be-because I didn't want him to think I was stupid! I mean, that was really embarrassing what happened to you!
I am still talking!! And then you chase away the one guy that I actually liked! I mean, no offense to you guys. Really! I mean congratulations on all the cash, and-and y'know--Wow! You do have very soft hair! But I would much rather go to the ball all by myself than go through anymore of this! Good-bye! Now do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair?!
Really?! How do you know?
What line?
Oh..Go..Oh..and I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren. If she finds out that I lied to her, she is going to hate me even more. Phoebe!!
Well, but Pheebs.
What?! Why?!
Yeah, we got him back. Everything's fine.
Yeah!
: We have apple cinnamon...
Oh God, oh, and then she told the funniest story...
That would be great!
Yeah.
Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was in love with you!
Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him. Now honey, you take care, you don't have those babies until I get back.
Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.
Hi! Oh, I'm so glad you called.
Yeah, what, so? You had feelings for me first.
Hi you!
Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome. I'm talking to Rome.
Hi!
Well, y'know this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea.
Hey!
Oh God, I really had a good time!
Oh my God, Phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?!
No, I think I'm gonna catch up on my correspondence.
Hey! Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?
Hi!
Ross! Come on! That's all right! Fine--Okay, I have a weird thing about my eye. Can we not talk about it please?
Ohh, ohh.
Well, Valentine's Day was like two weeks ago, so I wouldn't get her a calendar!
What's going on?
Well since I'm movin' out and-and you're so beautiful...
Yes!
What're you guys doing out here?
All gone! So, farm birds, huh?
I'm sure he will forgive you. Look, we have all been there! Y'know, you fight, you make up, it's just the way it works.
Yeah, don't push it though.
Well, isn't that a good thing? You said you were sick of this.
Oh, y'know what? I can't. I have to have dinner with that Melissa girl.
Ooh, I just wish we hadn't lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...
Show time!
Run Phoebe run.
There. Now there is.
Yeah, we could. Oh hey look! There's some Kappa Kappa Deltas! I was a Kappa. Hey sisters! Wow, we really are bitches.
Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!
