Come on see, she doesn't look that bad.
I did not!
Thank you. Thank you so much!
Oh it's OK. You were worth the wait, and I don't just mean tonight.
Okay.
Wow! Tell me something Joey--Whoa! I just fell right off the couch there.
Of course I clean it. I mean, I,I will cleeeean it. I mean, I will cleeeean it.
Yeah, they were very y'know...wrestley. But, I guess that's normal?
Y'know?
Well Phoebe, we gotta do something! Well, y'know. I mean there's no way Joey's gonna make it in time. So I'm gonna through the hotel and see if there's any other weddings going on.
Yeah. Don't do this to yourself.
No. Oh, oh, I guess it would be different if I were- with somebody.
Ohhh, yeah, me too.
Take care.
Yeah.
Ohh, well, this is just perfect!
No, yeah, Ive done that.
Hey!
Really? Really?!
Well no.
Oh yeah, I know, but the garbage was full.
Wow... Wow!
Ross, I don't, I just don't think it's going to fit.
Where's Chip, why isn't he here yet?
well, now, wait a second, who did I just put as my "In case of emergency" person?
I'm just visiting my good friend Carol.
OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus- Ow. That hurt
Oh, I don't know. I guess it's not about no guys, it's about the right guy, y'know? I mean, with Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat. With Paolo, that's all there was, was heat! And it was just this raw, animal, sexual...
I'd wait.
Well, I've been up since six. Thanks to somebody's dumb-ass rooster.
No, it's been three nights in a row.
So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?
What's goin' on?
Ross!
Okay! "Hello Ross, this is Dr. McNeeley from the Fake Accent University, we'd like you to come on board with us full time!
Hi-e!!
Phoebe's...
Well, it gets worse. When asked if you take initiative I wrote, "Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision," and under Problems with Performance I wrote, "Dear God, I hope not," and then uh, then I drew a little smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch.
And-Joey!
Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs...
Yes.
Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good?
Yeah, yeah, you go talk to your friend. You tell him, "Nice try."
Okay. Wait! Wait!
Yeah, what?
Okay, my turn!!
Uh-huh, go on.
Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.
We took our apartment back!!
Why aren't you guys at the movie?
Yeah, what's it about?
Are you serious?
Oops! All right, so what do you want to do now?
Oh.
Oh gosh, it has something to do with numbers.
There's been a teeny-teeny change in plans. It turns out that I'm not free tonight. So...
I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!
Thank you.
Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?
Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.
So, Spin The Bottle works like this I spin the bottle, it lands on Gunther, so I would have to kiss Gunther. (She crawls over to where Gunther is sitting and sees the look of anticipation on Gunther's face and decides not to kiss him.) All right. Who wants to go first?
I just, Phoebe, said y'know thought she saw something between you guys.
Really?
Yeah?
Well, y'know it's just been so long since I've been to Chuckie Cheese.
Well?
Well, I was thinking maybe a um, a romantic dinner with um, candles and wine and then uh, maybe going back to my place for um, dessert.
What?
Okay! Y'know what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three kids...
Hey!
Yeah!
Who was that?
Uhh.... waitressing?
All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.
Monica, please?
And uh, he will have a white wine spritzer.
Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
I know. I know. Oh God. There's no tissue! Can you grab me some toilet paper?
Sure.
What?!
Not interested.
Ross said my name. Okay? My name.
Your company has a fine foods division?
It's okay! It's okay! It kicked once, it'll kick again!
Oh good, great! I'll-I'll keep that in mind.
I went really long.
Hi!
Yeah.
Oh, honey, don't worry. She's gonna make it on time.
Oh.
Thank you judges.
No! Forget it! I am not gonna ask Frank to give you one of his kids!!
Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!
Hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?
Oh well, no I...
Hi!
Ahh, so do you, beautiful.
Yeah.
Thank you. Mon?
Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried...
Oooh!
Joey.
Oh, Ross, I'm sorry. I completely ruined your evening.
Oh, look at the little cat! Look at it!
Okay, you are crazy! I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset! I mean, listen!
Hello.
Woah, woah, woah, what book is this?
Is Joey Tribbiani here?
MONICA!!!! MONICA!!!!
Get your hands out of there! No!
Yeah-yeah, did-didn't you use to have a pair? They were really round, burgundy, and they made you look kind of umm...
Hey, how'd the interview go?
Oh, no-no-no, no-no-no, it has become, it has-yeah. Oh no, those were four great dates.
Wh, Ross what do you want from me? You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?
Oh yes, it's me! Sorry!
Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment? Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!
Well, well I can up with it!
No, you're not an idiot, Ross. You're a guy very much in love.
Well, okay, look. I don't know, listen, I don't know what's going on here but let's...
Uh, I don't know. Why don't you put it right here next to my water?
Hi! Sorry- sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost track of time.
Great, people having sex, that's just what I need to see.
Oh no! No! It's actually-it's very sweet. It's very sweet. Look! Yeah, do you want it?
Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.
You give me back my sweater or it's handbag marinara.
Ross kissed me.
Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! Every place I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. I mean, look at this; "Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." It's just, there is nothing! The city's full!
Thanks Chandler.
Sorry, I thought you were talking to me.
Yeah. Yeah. Definitely, well it definitely took me by surprise, but I'm okay.
I hope it's still funny when you're in hell.
Hello, Chip.
You ah, you didn't say 'Yes' to that did you?
So Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
Pheebs, Monica tripped me, I don't think I can ever run again, ever!
Hey!
Yeah, Joey honey, I don't know if this'll mean anything to you but you'll always be pre-approved with us.
Yeah!
Hey-hey, you guys oh hurry up, get some, there's a whole cart outside...
Oh, isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula.
Well where's Amanda?
Oh come on, what are you talking about? You've got three years painting houses. Two whole summers at T.G.I. Friday's, come on!
Right!
What? Guys, I'm not.
Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.
Good.
Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.
Yeah!
Where you goin'?
Why aren't you at work?
You have! Ross, you should give yourself credit. I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, "Once a cheater, always a cheater."
Oh no. No Ross, don't do this.
Really?! Got a little crush on Tag there do ya?
I'm a waitress.
Wow! H-umm! Hi! Yes, uh I'm sorry the models are actually down the hall.
Ok, doggie get the- aahhh. Ok go get the sandwich, get the sandwich doggie. Good doggie get the sandwich, get the...ok, Joey, the dog will lick himself but he will not touch your sandwich, what does that say?
Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending Thanksgiving with her.
What are you shushing?
Luisa? Oh my God! Monica! It's Luisa!
No! No! Phoebe, come on! I don't want to switch! Please come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!
So all we have is ice?
Ohh wow! I'm sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!
Yeah, sure. All right, whose court is the ball in now?
Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head.
Ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married.
Yes! Totally!
Alimony.
Uh-huh.
Oh yeah, c'mon, I'm movin' on. He can press her up against that window as much as he wants. For all I care, he can throw her through the damn thing.
What?
Petty...
Whoa, that Diet Coke just went straight to my head! Woo!
Shoot, shoot, this is never gonna work! He's right there!
Yeah, I guess. I-I... I mean, do-do you think we're ever gonna have that?
No! No! It's just that all the people in the entire world that I want to talk to are right here.
Oh yeah.
Maybe it's not as bad as I think. Y'know, maybe they didn't take it the way I meant it.
Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates?
Yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me?
Come on Joey, I just bought you a new chair! The most expensive one in the store! Hey, y'know what I was thinking? We could name her Francette.
Well wait a minute, what happened to Days of Our Lives?
Oh, Phoebe, that really cute guy is here again.
Who is it?
Don't say anything. I don't wanna speak, I don't wanna think. I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now.
He-he said Rachel, right? Do you think I should go up there?
No Ross!! Don't! You can't just kiss me and think you're gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesn't work that way. It doesn't just make it better. Okay?
It's not a miracle Joey! I'm sure there's some explanation.
Well, then, I guess that's the difference between us. See, I'd never make a list.
Yeah, whoosh!
Well, we have gotta find out if he's alive.
Really?! How do you know?
Well...
So you'll definitely get onstage, even if you don't win.
Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid! I had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard! Y'know you-I couldn't concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me. I mean come on, you remember what's it's like to be 19 and in love.
Paul. Umm, I just wanted you to know that Ross really is a great guy.
Okay.
That is so cool.
You still think of it as your apartment, don't you?
That's what I said! Thank you for being so nice.
Well, I-I know you can do that too. I'm just, I'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to... Hi!
I'm so sorry.
Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica's photo albums, I mean you don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks.
Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist...
No, I think I'm gonna catch up on my correspondence.
Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place.
Oh, I know. Look at him.
I uh, I have two tickets to the Knicks game tonight if you're interested, just as a thank you for this week.
Please, no, go, that'd be fine!
Hi, it's me. I've been trying to reach you all night. I feel awful. Please, Ross, you gotta know there is nothing between me and Mark. This whole break-up thing is just stupid.
This one is uh Paul O'Neil.
Ya think?
Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!
I'm sure he will forgive you. Look, we have all been there! Y'know, you fight, you make up, it's just the way it works.
Ohhh! That is soo sweet!
Oh, he brought her back to his apartment.
You are so just doing this out of spite.
Oh God! Y'know what I wish? I wish you were six years older. Well actually, if I'm wishin' for stuff, I actually wish I was six years younger.
Man! He just keeps lobbing them up and I just keep knocking them right out of the park!
Oh my God Phoebe, this is impossible! We can't do this by Friday! We have to find a place. We have to invite people! We have to get food! There's just too much to do! It's impossible! We can't do it! We cannot do it! We cannot do it!
Okay, wait a minute. Wait a minute, I-I-I, I can't do this. Listen honey, this is, it's not Phoebe's fault. She lent me the earrings, and I lost it. I'm so sorry. Honey, I feel terrible too.
You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch? Ohhh! I saw her with you on the subway and now she's asleep on the couch!
Okay, now that is the third time someone has said something like that to me today.
You mean, you mean 30 days?
Assistant buyer. Oh! I would be shopping... for a living!
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a girl?
That had to hurt!
I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...
All right, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't tell you but you were so mad already!
I... It just-it took me so long to get that desk organized.
Yes, I do.
What? You didn't get one.
Okay.
Hm-mmm!
Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.
I can't do this.
What?!
Hi.
Oh, okay, we're going. Yeah.
All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen.
Yeah.
You fell asleep?!
Well, you know I'm not surprised. I mean have you seen them together, they're really cute.
Uh-huh.
Wow.
Uh, to Stephanie Schiffer.
Oh my gosh, wow. Monica. Oh my god. Mom. This is so great.
Well sure, if you say you're gonna take care of everything I have no reason to doubt you. Give me those forms! All right, now I'm gonna do this my way and I don't want to hear a peep out of you!
Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so...
Ok, I will have the uh, side salad.
Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.
Okay great, hold on a sec! Oh, here you go! You don't mind do ya? That would really help me out a lot! Thanks!
Hi.
Oh, it's just an anti-theft device.
Hi! Hi Ben!
OK.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Honey, y'know I just gotta tell you, I think this is such a terrific thing you're having these babies for Frank and Alice.
Oh please. That Paolo thing was barely a relationship. All it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal sex. Ok, ya know, that sounded soooo much better in my head.
Okay. Umm, well, first I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you.
Yeah?
Funny book?
But we should move quick.
This one?
Oh, come on! I'll give you ten free Ralph Lauren shirts.
What?!! Stop it! Stop it! Oh my God!
So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?
Oh.
These are from Halloween three years ago.
That's right! 'Cause that would give him the control! So now he's all ooh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing y'know, trying to get me to hint around for an invitation. Blew up in his face, didn't it?
I know.
All right, how about I go over there and I will walk into Chandler's bedroom and I will see that thing that I think that I know is actually the thing that I think that I know!
OK, OK.
Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier...
Yeah me too.
Well, I-I could live without it.
How long?
Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's the difference!
Mr. Treeger.
Settle what?
Hey, how'd it go?
Uh-huh.
Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was in love with you!
Oh so-so not really never.
Nothing. I don't want to do anything.
He's perfect, he's never been better.
Well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them?
Wh-what do you mean?
Phoebe, what are you doing?
Ok mom, you know what, fine, I'll make an appointment ok, but you know what, right now, I gotta go, I gotta go do a thing.
And did you notice...?
Noooo.
You're welcome.
Really? You think so?
Yeah, I'm just mad!
Well, I didn't know what else to do!
We are looking at a Playboy.
Hey Mon!
Bye!
Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey.
Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written. No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a writer.
I don't know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it'll die.
And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high school, I was a cow?
No! I'm sorry, honey, it's just that last week I got all but three answers and I really want to finish a whole one without any help.
Please! We did not fog Danny! Who's Danny?
Hi!
So, he's on the show, he knows what happens.
Well, from me. And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite.
No!! No! He's not married, or involved, with anyone!
Oh my God!
Hey Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.
Yeah?
What do you get? Emily!! Emil-Whoa!! Okay! So that's me as a cheerleader! Ta-dum!
Its back in cage!
Well, that's great.
Yeah, right, he almost danced me right down that...garbage chute.
Oh, yeah! Yeah!
Okay.
Diane Keeton.
Oh, seriously?
So umm, what time are you supposed to leave?
Are you gonna let me play?
Yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?!
What is the emergency?!
Okay. Oh wait! One more thing umm, do-do we still need to uh settle the question of "us?"
Okay.
Here you go.
OOooooo!
When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rock bottom. But today, it's like there's rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, then me.
Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about. Hey.
Well, why doesn't he practice with a girl?
Hi! Okay, don't be mad at me, but I couldn't resist.
Oh, can we read them?
Yeah Phoebe, I completely understand.
Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happen to me? A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine. Ross was just Ross, just this guy. Now he's Rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I can't have.
Oh my God! How?!
Okay, well can't you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?
What? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what's the matter?
That's also the smaller piece. Okay, there you go. Enjoy your half my friend, but that is it. No sharing. No switching, and don't come crying to me if you eat your piece to fast. Oh!!!!
Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...
Oh no, I know that. I know that. Although, we made a joke that we spend so much time together he should call me his work wife.
Well okay-Well don't ruin it! Just play along at least!
Hi!
Oh, by the way Mon, I don't think the mailman liked your cookies. Here are the ornaments your mom sent.
Oh, Joey, look who it is.
Ok, so anyway, you were telling me about Paris, it sounds fascinating.
They're in Vermont!! How could this happen?!
The whole night was horrible, it was pouring down rain, and when I got there, there was no Rachel Green on the list, but there was a Rachel Greep.
Off to see young Ethan?
Ok, we can do this now, can't we Ben? Yes we can, yes we can. There. I did it. I did it. Look at that, oh, stays on and everything. Hi.
You're not an artist.
Oh!
Oh, God, no problem. So you're gonna go with the uh, waiting thing?
No-no! Don't dance for me! Please? Don't! What is the matter with you guys?
What?!
Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad.
Thank you.
Ohhh!!!
Come on. Oh! And, uh, by the way....
No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!
Beefsteak Charlie's?
Remind me to introduce you to someone!
Oh my God.
Well, I-I guess-I...
Well, we were just talkin' about you guys gettin' married and how great it is.
Hi you. I can't believe I'm waking up next to you.
Yeah honey, I'm standing right there! Why didn't you just tell him about the mole I haven't got checked yet.
It's coming from Joey!
It was unbelievable!
Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.
Yeah. What kind of discount do we get?
Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious.
Thank you. Thank you. I love you.
Oh, come on squeeze it.
Ah, I-I never should have said what I said. It-y'know what? It just doesn't matter how I feel. I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay? Big day Monday lots to do. So, we're okay?
Sure, is she married?
Well y'know, it's you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff! Y'know? I mean, you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! I guess I'm not upset because I don't see you guys going through with it. I'm sorry.
But Pheebs, y'know you earned it.
Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that.
Oh my God.
Ohh, you can say. Come on, I don't want you to feel like you can't tell me things.
Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me. What?
Ohh, I just don't think I have enough left on my credit card.
Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories......about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.
What is the matter with you?!
Say it!
Yeah.
Ooo! Oh, I forgot they made sheets!
What?!
Isn't it incredible?! Monica and Chandler, gettin' married.
Have fun!
Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be...
No, we kinda broke up instead.
I'm not telling.
Hi you!
Yeah.
Oh, that's funny!
Oh, hi sweetie.
Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back!
Oh, I am so sorry.
No-no they do but, you just have to wait.
Oh, oh, this is good, this is really good.
Hello, excuse me.
Whatever Linus, I'm opening mine.
Small...
Oh my God!!! Ross!!
I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks.
What?!
Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing.
That's great!
No! Joey!
I got a touchdown! We did it!!
Well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.
I thought it was Chandler!
Why?
Oh wait, I have the ten of spades! Here!
Yes. Here you go Officer uh, Handsome.
No.
Okay honey, you can finish this later we're gonna be late. We gotta go.
Okay, very cute braces. Anyway y'know what, the point is Tag, start looking because you are going to find those contracts on your desk.
Can I see that for second.
Uh, yeah, if you want too.
Okay.
Really?!
Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks.
"Pheebs, can't make it, got a date. Talk to you later. Big Daddy." Big Daddy?
Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! I cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!
No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge step down!
What?
Oh, that's true.
Oh my God, its happening. It's already started. I'm Kip.
Ooh, ooh, ooh,ooh,ooh. Hi.
Well, I, umm...
Yeah, come on! What's going in on in there?
Wait a minute!
Ooooh! Wow!! Oh, hi.
I'm off my break now so uh, um here you take this and um, I am gonna go pour these very nice people some coffee. Ok. Oh look at that, I don't have a pot. I don't have a pot. Well, hey, maybe I've got one at home, or in Scarsdale. Hey is that a door?
Well, it's embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy.
Ross you're not listening to me, I don't have time to stop.
Honey, come on, I have to be at work in like ten minutes Oh, all right, well it's not like I'm employee of the year or anything.
I'm sorry!
Oh no!
Oh, I'm sorry what?
Me too!
That is not true. She did! She forced me!
What?
What?
Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this.
Well, well, you said it was practice!
No! God, would you just calm down!
Oh.
Oh no, at the Grammies I always win.
Ah.
No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?
What's this?
Yeah, it was senior year in college. It was after the Sigma Chi luau and Melissa and I got very drunk! And we ended up kissing! For several minutes!
Well, she told me. She said she's kinda a loner.
Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs. Thief.
Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?
OK... ah, it's light... ...it rattles... it's... Travel Scrabble! Oooohhh, thank you!
Well do you get to look through one of those like, those periscope thingys.
Hey!
Okay.
Y'know what you should do?
No.
Okay, now what was that all about? Is it-does it not taste good? Let me try it.
Oh, okay, not so weird.
Unbelievable.
Are you sure?
Huh-huh, no act--no, uhh, that, that is basil.
All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!
Joey, how do you make that dirty?
I'm sorry, sweetie.
Yeah right.
Yeah, well Betty's kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates. Now, while I distract her, you get in the office.
You, you, you said he liked me. You, you slowpokes!
Me either. Umm, all right, first thing I need you to do is go downstairs and find a women named Hilda and tell her to go home.
C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat.
No, you wait! This is ridiculous!
Really?!
Do you want some pancakes?
God. I feel violated.
Yeah! Especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around...
Yeah! It's weird. But the thing is need to find a date.
Oh yeah.
So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up, so Ross selflessly, offered to take me.
Yeah, but he waited until the last minute! So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. I said, "No!" Which puts me right back in the driver seat.
Okay, uhh, I think I'm going to run to the ladies room.
Ross, it's too hard.
No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?
