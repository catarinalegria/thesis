Oh look, a low budget puppet show.
I don't know.
Sometimes, you should come over sometime! I'll play you one of my other...
No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel?
Carol?
No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie.
Ok. No, hey, whoa, whoa, I'll get your coat.
Oh! Yeah.
What? What? What?
Hi.
Monica and Chandler are living together!
You wanna watch Laverne y Shirley?
Yeah. I'm paying you to stop.
Pheebs, if you don't tell him, soon he's gonna be married, and then you're gonna hate yourself.
No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.
Ahhhh!!
'Cause I know what you're trying to pull here. Okay? It's not gonna work.
No!
You don't know?! Rach, you balded my girlfriend!
Yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. It's not just about the pictures.
She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.
Phoebe! You and I have never played chess!
When?
Can't do it, can you?
No! But we-we didn't have...sex-uh, did we? I mean, I don't remember much about last night, it was such a blur.
The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?
You like it?
What guys? Oh, yeah.
Oh, just planning my bachelor party with my best man.
It's all right! Everything's gonna be all right.
Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years.
Hey! What's up?
You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys?
Yeah, but not very well, unless 14-across, 'Gershwin musical' actually is bitemebitemebitemebiteme.
That's right.
No, it's really not that bad. I mean, I-I for one, feel perfectly safe.
How'd did it go?
I'm sorry your husband cheated on you.
No! I balanced my checkbook.
Oh my God! Those weren't albino kids, that was computer camp! Rach!
What-what-what the-how da-how did-what the-how did-what?!
Oh, Carol and I have a new system. If she punches in 911, it means she's having a baby, otherwise I just ignore it.
Marcel! What've you done to him?
You got me.
I don't know, aheh, your's was the first name that-that popped into my head, I'm I'm sorry. I-I didn't think it would matter.
Let me finish, okay? She started kissing me and-and I didn't stop it. I guess I-I just wasn't thinking...
Yeah, well...nah.
Hey! It's 42-21!
You're right!
Nonono, thatthat's not what I was saying...
Woah, woah, woah australopithicus isn't supposed to be in that display. No. No. No, n, homo-habilus was erect, australopithicus was never fully erect.
Hi!
Ah, we're out. I sold them all.
Alright, alright, here's the chance. Monica give him cash, Rachel give him your earrings. Something, now, anything.
Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too.
What?
Hello.
Good morning. Hey pal, look who I brought. It's your old friend Harry Elefante.
What is ah, Rach in her room?
Well, I don't know, it's-it's kinda in a place that's not... It's not visually accessible to me, and I was hoping maybe you guys could-could help me out.
Oh, I know. Y'know, just-just talking about it is getting me kinda...
Hi. I understand you had a little talk with Emily.
What?
What should I wear, now I'm all nervous.
Where's my ring? My dead grandmother's wedding ring? Where is it? Where is it?
Hey. How did, uh, how'd it go today?
No, its...Its not that. Umm, now what I'm going to say to you, I'm not saying as your friend. Okay? I'm-I'm saying as it as Monica's older brother.
Hey!
You comin'?
Hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about?
No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one.
Hey!
Fine by me; hope she wins.
Rach. OK, forget, forget the lobsters OK. We're, let's talk, what about us?
Yeah, we went shopping!
Look, you guys don't need me here taking up your space.
Oh, sure! I'm sure.
No, I, I only know Lipson.
What? I'm kidding. You know I'd never let him touch the Porsche.
'Pwease, Aunt Monica, pwease?' Oh, unclench. You're not even gonna be there.
Oh man, this is hilarious.
Wait! Wait! Wait! Y'know what? Just stay. Please? It uh... It would really mean a lot to me if you stayed.
Oh, actually I haven't even been home yet. Do you mind if I check my messages?
You know what, this is ridiculous, ok. This is your birthday, this is your party. I say we just put 'em all together and if they can't deal with it, who cares.
'Cause, I'm a stupid, stupid man.
I just wanna thank you for being there for me today. And I'm sorry I,I almost broke your hand.
Which one is Gina?
They put that in.
I'm tellin' you. You can't do this.
Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?
Oh really, really great! Yeah! A-actually she's right down the street, umm, do-do you know what? You should stop bye and say hi.
Why does anyone have to be naked?
Hey! I just got uh, my teacher evaluations! Check out what this one student wrote, "I loved Dr. Geller's class. Mind blowing lectures! Dr. Geller, you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department!"
What's her last name?
So how'd it go?
Ohh.
See ya!
Hey!
I mean you're not gonna give me a-a ticket for driving too slow are ya?
MY SANDWICH!!!!!!
I'd bet I'd still be doing my kara-tay. Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y'know, not doing anything else physical.
Take thee, Rachel... Emily. Emily.
We are never gonna find him! He's one guy in a huge city!
Huh? Oh-oh, it was fine. Uh, it was just a misunderstanding. She didn't want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that she's going to Florida for spring vacation.
I'm sorry.
Look, I'm sorry, I thought it looked pretty.
You know the song! Sing along!
Step back.
Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!
Get away!
Oh yeah! Wasn't she uh...
She does want to.
No!!
Well, there goes my whole belief system.
I will be! Listen, I don't want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?
Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know. So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so. . .
Yeah? How much?
All right. Feel good?
Yeah!
Ok, ok, you know what? I think you're very funny. Kudos on that hat joke. But, come on guy just, just give him back the hat.
All right here. Watch me execute the three 'P's of championship play. Power. Precision. and penache.
Before I forget, are we hitting faces?
Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night? Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!!
Hey!
I- I- I ca- I can't believe this. I mean, all I asked you to do was keep him in the apartment.
Rach! Rach!
Hi.
Wow! I could've died tonight.
And here's little Ben nodding off...
And thank you, for that.
Are you sure? Because I can stay out as late as you want. I told you how I'm on sabbatical from work, right?
I'm shipping out tomorrow.
Not at the concert.
Damn! I can't believe I took her off my list.
No!
What's going on?
Oh my God, what's goin' on?
No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!
I bet two dollars.
I don't know. What's in this pie?
Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts.
Oh really? What uh, what does he want with her?
Okay.
Yeah!
Yeah. He could row like a viking.
Why not?
Must pee.
OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah...
Okay. So well I'll umm, I'll have her home by midnight.
Wow! Thanks, you guys. That's uh-ohhh, I wanna, I wanna play you another piece! Umm! Uh-oh! I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. I'll be right back! Okay? This is so nice, I'm-I am so...
And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay? So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing. Now, I know what you're thinking, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you're right, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with...girls.
S-s-smell her hair? What if I did?
Take thee, Emily. Like there'd be anybody else.
Okay, that's, that's enough.
No. No. No, I'm-I'm glad you did. Look, if nothing else, it's-it's always great when someone tells you they love you.
Okay, okay! I'm going. I'm going.
Emily? Emily? I'm coming in.
Chandler!
So listen uh, I know you and I haven't really had a chance to talk since uh, Emily and I decided to get married, and uh, I was just wondering how you were.
Department of Sanitation?
I know, why not?
I will, I will find him.
Hmm.
No, Rach!
Toilet paper?
I don't know. A month?
Thank you!
I had just moved in. Thank you! Listen umm...
What kind of problem?
Am I?!
Yeah, sure.
DANGER!!!!
Yes, yes, that's right...
Joey, you are gonna love this guy. Gandolf is like the party wizard!
Y'know, it-it doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here. You're my friend, and you're here. Oh!
Okay. So we're, we're good?
Hey!
I can't belive you two had sex in her dream.
No, it's a concept!
Hi!
Home is Home Star stew.
Come on, you made coffee! You can do anything!
Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by "bye!"
I don't think charging new clothes too your dad qualifies as making it on your own.
Oh my God! Rach-Rach, are-are-are you sure?
...will be two months...
Heavy thing, not getting lighter!
Emily.
Because! Because, it-it-it's... It'd be like you having this guitar and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar wants to be played! And-and this bike wants to be ridden and-and if you don't ride it you-you're-you're killing its spirit! The bike is dying.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown didn't count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose breaking.
That's okay Rach, we're not liking Ross right now.
Hey, tell Dan, 'Thanks.'
Phoebe? Phoebe?
You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you.
Just a sandwich. Turkey, a little mustard...
All I have to do is close my eyes. See? Woo-hoo!!
Nevermind!
Everybody!
Okay, I didn't know you would say that.
Freakish.
