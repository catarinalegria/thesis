Yeah!
Ohhh.
Uh, hello!
Alright, alright, here's the chance. Monica give him cash, Rachel give him your earrings. Something, now, anything.
Yeah, yeah, she's here.
So don't, I don't see why we have to go to this thing anyway, it's your ex-fiancee's wedding.
Maybe not.
Hi.
Okay, let's go.
You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.
Ohh, you can see them, huh?
Ohh! Ohh! In college, Chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm!
Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid. I mean look at him, look at you,
Phoebe, why'd you do it?
Also an island.
Oh God. We didn't get into Scranton. That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don't know who this is harder on, me or him.
Oh-oh, absolutely!
I don't know, but-but look how shiny!
People can hear you.
At the vet.
Wow!
Emily that's ridiculous. Look, I'm-I'm moving for you, I'm cutting friends out of my life for you. Please, just get on the plane and come to New York. Okay, you'll see you're the only person I want to be with.
You can see where he'd have trouble.
Wow, hello! You look great!
And, and uh, you-you remember my friend Chandler.
Oh Donald that-that would be great. I am totally ready to come back to work. I-What? No! Wh... What are you doing?!! GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hey-yeah. Hey Gunther, can I have a scone please? Wanna hear some good news? Someone I know is getting married! Yeah! And weddings are happy occasions! Oh, by-the-by it's my ex-wife Emily!
She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.
No.
Come on, Rachel, come on! Talk to me! Please!!
No-no-no-no-no.
Right.
Yeah?
Yep.
Marcel! What've you done to him?
Listen to me! When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea.
You have 30 seconds. And the lightning round begins-stop it -now. What was Monica's nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
Just one uh, one additional relationship thought. Probably something your already familiar with, uh, women talk!
Y'know, I think they have those at that British pub near the trade center.
What am I going to do?
Yeah.
Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so.
No-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island.
I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!
Okay. Wow, it's-it's 5:30 in the morning. So, I'd better get cracking on this baby.
Mmm.
It's over.
Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head! Straight up over your head! You can do it! You can do it! Okay. You got it?
Well, why're you all dressed up?
Hey! What's she doing back here?
Yeah.
Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person.
Marcel! Where are you going with that disc?
Yeah?
Y'know, y'know I'm lookin' and I don't think anyone's home here. I say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and y'know explain later.
You're gonna be an aunt.
Why?! How?! How is he a genius?
No problem.
Well, uh, do you have a Santa-outfit left?
Really? I mean, I, I had a whole speach prepared.
Nothing, nothing. Everything's under control.
Not-not really. Th-th-there was just Carol.
Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.
What you don't think I'd go up to her?
That's a little clearer.
Probably around gonorrhea.
OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
You chipped in?!
What?
Umm, say you're gonna be starving after all this moving. What do you say I take you to dinner tonight?
Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the Paleontology section? See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.
Of course it is. Yeah, come on in. Ooh-ooh, go by the window you can pretend to be surfing.
And, uh, and then I kissed her.
Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica. Oh, I guess he doesn't feel like talking right now. He's smiling though! Okay, talk to you later.
Doorknob! Doorknob!
Who would you rather be Simon or Garfunkle?
One-Mississippi, two-Mississippi, switch! Switch! Switch!!
You think?
Hello. Oh hi, are you on your way ove-. Oh. No, no, I, I understand, I mean a monkey's gotta work. No it, it's no big deal, it' not like I uh, had anything special planned. Yeah OK, OK. OK, OK, bye.
Oh, who cares?
Yeah.
All right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again.
Kinda like a big face without skin.
I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...
Mike "Gandolf" Ganderson, only like the funest guy in the world.
The Geller Cup.
Fine. I just need to know that you're not gonna tell your sister.
No, sorry I don't. Tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life? What if it doesn't come out right Phoebe? Then it's like, I don't know, havin' a bad hair cut all the time. Why's everyone staring at me?
Eh, either way I'll pass. I still can't eat those. What's so funny?!
Hey man.
Way to go guys. Y'know, you-you were really good at the stuff too.
So we should probably get going soon.
Uh yeah! Let me, let me get that for you.
What do you like better flora or fauna?
Umm, did you notice anything wierd about Ben today?
Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child.
How sad are we?
Well, ya know, someone should have called me.
Who cares? I repel women.
Well, what about me?! I'm a medical marvel!!
No!
I'm sorry, my pie was, was in your hood. Now I just have to get the coffee out of that guy's pants and I'll be back in the hospital by 7.
Well she should, it was taken ten years ago!
If the place you are referring too is being in love, then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place!
Wh- are you welling up?
Dude, what are you doing?
It does. It really and truly does.
Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!
Thank you.
OK, fine, well I'm not gonna watch, alright.
Pheebs come on! I mean, consider the source! Of course her ex-husband's gonna say that stuff. Now, if you'll excuse me...
Yes, yes it is. In prison!
Oh hey, Gary, want me to grab the berry for ya?
Okay, I think I got it.
Rach, I got a message from you. Who's Michael?
OK, I'm gonna go say goodbye to the guys.
I couldn't possibly eat another bite.
Umm...
Oh my god.
Sure! Ooh-ooh, what about this?
Still I could tell. She was into me. Well, why don't you set us up?
Get away from me I said no!
Yeah?
Look I told you...
So um...Thanksgiving. The holiday season is upon us, hm?
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. Sorry. Sorry! Hey! Hey! I got my s's back! Which we can celebrate later. Celebrate.
What?
Sure! Oh, and Joey's got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.
Well, I asked him if he wanted to eat, he said, "No." I asked him if he wanted to sleep, he said, "No." I asked him what he wanted to do, he said, "No." So, he's sweeping.
Phoebe.
Ok. Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian.
I'd like that.
What? I'm kidding. You know I'd never let him touch the Porsche.
Ok. Here's his diaper bag, and his uh, Mr. Winky, and uh...oh, him. Hi!
It was a dry day.
A no sex pact huh? I actually have one of those going on with every woman in America.
Let me see, I gotta see, I gotta see. Oh, a head. Oh, it's, it's huge. Carol, how are you doing this?
Okay, I did not abandon Rachel! Okay? Emily showed up at the airport! I had to go after her! I mean, I-I did what I had to do! She's my wife! Rachel is my wife! Y'know-Emily! Emily, is my wife! Man, what is that?
Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!
Save it.
Oh, great. Great. There was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, why not?
What?
Okay. But not about this!
You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?
What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again?
Yeah. So...
Okay, each team will answer ten questions. The first team that answers the most questions wins. Okay, the categories are, Fears and Pet Peeves, Ancient History, Literature, and It's All Relative. Now, the coin toss to see who goes first. Okay, somebody call it this time.
What happened?
Pop it in.
No, I-I'm saying I liked her.
And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!
What-what are you doing?! Are you-Okay that's not funny! Just stop horsing around!
So, Dr. Green, how's the old boat.
Hi.
Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don't I have to wait a while?
Hi.
Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name?
All right, try pedaling.
Thank you, thanks. Yeah, I lost it. Y'know, I'm not gonna play anymore, would you, can you finish my set?
That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him.
Tell me about it. So what, what's your magic number?
Not broad backed!
I'm sorry, I've got plans with my sister.
Yeah, like I could lose it.
Okay, why are you here?
Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck?
Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust.
Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.
That's okay, I'll just pick 'em off.
Alright. The, uh, the neighbours must be vacuuming. Well, so long as we're here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um...
Hey Mon.
You sure?
No! No! No! No-no-no-no.
No, 19.
Oohh, 23. Which is what we play to at this casino! You win 10 dollars!
I was thinkin' about it.
Oh, no! No-no! No, I tired! But I couldn't. That's why I'm here. Maybe we could attack them together? That-that's a no.
No! The reason I'm asking is that... I sorta had one last night.
Marc- oh, this is ridiculous! We've been all over the neighbourhood. He's gone, he's-he's just gone.
Great to see you!
Yeah?
Well we did it, we're here. We are standing our ground. How long does a cup of coffee take?
Noo.
Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe goind into the robot, y'know?
There was no song. There was no song!
So we're a little late.
Awww, man! Really?
I picked up the divorce papers. Uh, I've already signed everything and I put little 'X's where you need to sign.
How come? Everybody else does.
I sort've already asked Chandler.
Wh-what did he say?!
Did homo-erectus hunt with wooden tools?
Oh, no! No!
With you?! Yeah right!
Well, it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woo-hoo. That means, that means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girl's bodies, waking up next to people you don't even know...
