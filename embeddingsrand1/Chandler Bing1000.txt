Let me see this guy. W-H-Wow! Don't show this to Monica! And don't tell her about the W-H-Wow!
Yeah, that's like the most ugliest dress I've ever seen. Wh-why do you to return it?
Uh why, do you have a lecture?
Eh, somebody's in a good mood!
Wow, you look...
But you found me!
Oh yeah, but don't worry. I don't think anybody's gonna focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress.
Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.
But those are the words! Those exact words!
That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her.
That's me! Come on!
Uh-oh.
She's not as pretty as she was when she was 29.
Oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom.
Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia.
Hey!!
It's a big company, I don't-if you-I...
No I didn't!
Oh no! No! No! No!
Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.
And I think Ross is generous too.
Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...
You're watching a football game at a funeral?
Math!! You're giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forget about it, you go for the girl, we'll see who gets her.
Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft.
Oh yeah, that sounds great. Oh, and listen, it's, it's gonna be....
Bye!
Hey, listen, I know I came in late last week, but I slept funny, and my hair was very very &ndash;
Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?
Okay Ross, why don't you come with me?
Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.
I bet he can.
So--You got in voluntarily?!
Hi. We're the guys who called about the baby. We left the baby on ths bus. Is he here? Is he here?
Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!
Well that's not fair, you've already had some!
Okay.
No, no he went for a walk.
Bye.
Well, I then guess I'm going to Yemen! I'm going to Yemen! When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?
Thanks.
Yeah, we got, um-hmm.
Oh my god!
I don't know. I just had this weird sense. You know, but that's me. I'm weird and sensitive. Tissue?
No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg.
At this?!
Why not?!
How can I answer that when I'm pretending I don't know you?
Who was it?
You got it. Good woman! Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
Because I'm in love with Monica!!
Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still feel bad?
Okay!
What?
Yeah, why not. So I told her.
Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in...vegetables, Joey?
That's it?
Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.
What's an identical hand twin?
Go on.
Hmmm, that's very cool.
No, that's okay. Monica I thought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever gonna had to do. But when I saw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprises that come our way it's okay, because I will always love you. You are the person I was meant to spend the rest of my life with. You wanna know if I'm sure?
Whoa-whoa-whoa!
No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?
You okay over there?
Well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families.
You know I think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh, you know, isn't capable of that emotion.
Please, don't take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!
What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!
Maybe, isn't she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?
Sure.
Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse.
You, you are gonna love this.
Joey, it's been three days, okay.. Your just a little homesick, Okay. Would you just try to relax. Just, just try to enjoy yourself.
I was being Shelly Winters from The Poseidon Adventure.
Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow.
Don't try to sway her. I'm your only chance to have a baby. Okay, let's go.
Whoa!
Get out. Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
Oh, ooh.
You okay there man?
Ok, while Ross is on the phone, everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday.
This is gonna be soo cool, dude, we never party anymore!
Aww.
What's wrong?
What?!
Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? : "When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy!"
Well, that's pretty much all I'm looking for from these people.
I love you. And I know about the baby.
Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we've got reservations at Ja George.
Ahh, I think it just moved. It's really poking me.
So ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?!
No. When it comes to sweets, he's surprisingly strict.
I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.
What?
Because, if Santa and the Holiday...Armadillo? ...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!
Well, it sounds kinda stupid... Who's she?
Hey.
No they didn't!
Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.
Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know..
Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay.
What are you, stop naming dwarves! Hello, Janice. Hi, I'm so glad that you called, I know I've been acting a really weird lately. And, it's just because I'm crazy about you, and I just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid a couple of more times. I'm sorry. Really?! Really?!
Does for me.
And I love the milk! But, I'm not gonna some British girl to move in with me! Joey, you say things now.
Is it--?
Okay.
Oh.
Well, somebody should.
Oh no-no-no, I'm, I'm paddling away!
That's great!
Oh-ho-ho-ho.
Uh, hey!
It's happened to you?
Really?
Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... ...now I wish I was dead.
Veronica. Look, it's got to be Veronica, the girl in the red skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.
I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?
Okay. Joey, trade lives with me!
Bye.
Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold separately.
Tuna or egg salad? Decide!
Yep! From now on its gonna be the four of you guys and me and the misses. The little woman. The wife. The old ball and chain.
I'm here to see Mary-Angela.
I'm free! I'm free!
H-He's in China!
Yes! Yes! I'm good! Are you good? Are you good? Is everything-are you-are you perrr-perfect?!
Oh that's great! Right there! Can we get some of that over here please? There we go.
Yeah umm, they're called wallets.
Hello Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day.
Hey!
She said yes!! She said yes!! Awful play, man. Whoah. Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way. Oh, listen, the usher gave me this to give to you.
They're still just friends, right?
It's the Miracle Wax.
No, really you're gonna freeze.
Well, I'm going to kill you.
Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number.
Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.
What's going on?
She's just doing her job!
Well yeah, in that it's not being used and I... have it to spare.
Oh, they said uh, "You don't have insurance here, so stop calling us."
Who?
Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park and hit rocks at...bigger rocks. Hey Rach, do you have a tennis racquet?
Oh yes!
You have no trouble telling time now right?
Ba dum bumb cheshhh!
We think he was trying to spell out 'MONKEY.'
Janice?!
That's easy, baggage claim.
You think?
If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel.
Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. Little tip: if youre ever in a similar situation, never ever leave your hand... ..on the desk.
I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?
Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didn't I?
Yeah, we really missed you guys.
Look Eddie, aren't you forgetting anything?
Listen, Phoebs, this is gonna be OK. Ross, Russ. Russ, Ross.
Okay, we owe you a present.
I think you should go back with Gary. I don't wanna be the guy that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy. Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know 'You're the reason, you are the reason why their not together.' and I hated that guy. And it didn't matter how nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad.
Well, what is it?
Well, You could, but... probably just the one time.
Yep, I'm in a tree.
Ah that's a cantelope.
Phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago.
Yes that would have made more sense.
Oh, this is soo bad.
No-no-no-no-no-no-no, you are not getting me this way.
...Poulet passes it up to Leetch!
Stay back, I've got kiwi. Run, Joey, Run!
Wow! That ripped! That ripped real nice!
That's a bad duck!!! How'd the thing go tonight, Ross?
Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!
Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and don't talk to anyone.
I think that's gum.
So, Joey on Law & Order, you must be very proud!
Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?
Really stupid.
I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...
Uh, could you leave me one?
And the Knicks rule all.
Depends on what you mean by we.
Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
So I really never get to win anymore?
No-no-no, y'know what? I really shouldn't have said that you were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn't cool. And if it makes you feel any better, I've had a really lousy day.
Well, close to...
Oh, well thank you in advance.
Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.
Okay, bye! Oh my God!!
Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players.
Why don't you use ours across the hall, 'cause she...has...problems.
Well, we're-we're hanging out in here!
That was so unlikely. Well, let's get married! I guess.
Okay. Okay. What are you gonna do to me if you get the part?
Excuse me, Doug? Hey there sports fan!!
I have the lung capacity of a two year old.
I can't believe I ruined this.
So what happened?
Hey.
Dude, don't do that too me!
Sorry, we're on a major flan high.
Well it's not flexed right now!
Yeah, right here in my pocket. Pheebs?
Oh great!
It's like this, me, no jokes.
You can say that because she's not your mom.
I'm an alien. I'm an alien.
Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had.
Robert's coming out.
Oh, that's fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts.
Well, I'm guessing he wants to do a little dance. . . ya know, make a little love. . . well pretty much get down tonight.
I thought it was $98.50.
I can't believe you came back.
Ohh yes.
Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me?
All right...
Oh well, not as lovely as you. I mean, I can't believe that you would have a thirty-year-old daughter! And you! I can't believe that you would have a tux that's thirty years old!
...The second guy.
Listen to me!!
Well you know, we got to talking and uh, he said he needed a place and I had a spare room.
No-no-no-no, this is bad! It's bad! This is bad!
Well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend and her brother, I can't do that we promised we'd make each other gifts this year.
You understood that?
Yes!
So you're really okay with this?
What?!
An old cookie?
Hi!
Hi.
Consider Casey.
Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the place where I-I made it and pick-pick it up.
Again I must go back to, how?
Oh, so you're going with the teacher, huh?
Okay.
It is the softest hair! Touch it!
Like, when you're cooking a steak.
Come on Chloe! Finish up with your customer first. Come on Chloe! Come on Chloe!!
What?
Yeah, what was wrong with your old...human teeth.
I think I do! Thank you, Monica.
Totally.
You mean this.
And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty seven dollars. No strings attached. Now, if you can't remember that, I think we should write it down-let's write it down!
What is with him?
So we both finished our vows.
Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.
So, you feel like a dad yet?
Hey.
Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you.
No way!
Hey! Well, I've been preparing for that my entire life! Or something about you that's mean!
Really?! You do that?
That's a mailman! That's our mailman! Hi. How are ya?
This isn't your first surprise party, is it sir?
Hi Monica.
Get in here! Hey, and you can not smoke in here! Merry Christmas.
Well, it's like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake.
Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.
Look forget it okay? I don't want to go. I don't want to see him. I don't wanna.
No, no, no.
Tell me it's "you and me" we.
Glass, sand, whatever.
Good luck.
Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll-Ups?
I did, but...
Joey, be a pal. Lift up my hand and smack her with it.
Her ankle is what you're watching?
Well, stuff like where'd we live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on it's collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
Thanks Joey, that's a good idea.
Sorry, I just don't like the idea of when I say, "I do," he's thinking, "Yeah, I'd do her too!"
I'm sorry. If you ask me, I'd move in with him.
What?
Sure, you guys don't have this problem, you're made of wood. Hey!
Yeah, but uh, it was 1982 and my flock of seagulls haircut was tickling her chin.
I'm never gonna find a roommate, ever.
How do you know so much about this?
Oh, don't say that! Don't say that. That's not true. Is it?
Yes!
Honey, it's gonna be okay.
We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.
Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a party.
No, no, you're right, it is a ridiculous name!
Hey!!
Drop off my dry cleaning. Pick up my vitamins. Teach me how to spell vitamins. Wear in my new jeans.
Uh, The Wheatsheaf.
Janice's birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me.
Oh hey, it's, it's terriffic. I mean it's a regular space... fest.
Yeah, well, I don't dance at weddings.
Thank you!
This isn't one of those uh, y'know "If she doesn't come, we-we don't, we don't come?" Right? Because I already bought my ticket...
Okay, I gotta go to work.
Huh.
Are you funny?
Oh okay, I'll-I'll try.
Hi! Nice to meet you!
Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!
Oh, the tears are real.
Okay.
Oh I see, I see, because of the third nipple thing. Ha ha ha ha. . .
No!
Okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. And second, that was not flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. That is all.
What are you doing here?
Oh no-no-no. This is amazing.
Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, "Quack, quack!" I'm happy all the time!
Uhh, no.
Because, I'm too afraid.
Now-now, why would you say that Joseph?
So, Spock actually hugs his father?
All right. I thought about it and maybe you're right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.
Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!
No, I got him.
Our minister...
'S'why I'm dancing...
We are bad people.
All right!
Like what?
Oh, it's okay. I don't...
Oh yes, somebody just said, "Can you hear anything?"
So when you said, "Get up early," did you mean 1986?
I'm out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?
Hey.
Right on! Oh! Uh, but, don't take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez.
Ooooh.
Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a copier. Look, if there was anything I could do, I would do it. Okay? But everybody's allowed one mistake, right?
Hey.
Stupid, useless Canadian money!
Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection.
Oh, hello Rachel.
OK.
Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now.
I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.
Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!
Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding...
I'll take one. Sometimes I like to hold stuff like this and pretend I'm a giant.
I KNEW IT!!!!
Okay!
Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.
Okay, well, it's definite, two more weeks of winter.
Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.
Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.
So, are you guys in the movie, or are you just really paranoid.
Ok so, can I have my hat back?
Hey. Well, you will all be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow night. This woman, Alison, from work. She's great. She's pretty, she's smart. And uh, I've been holding off on asking her out in the past, because she has an unusually large head. But, I'm not gonna let that stuff hang me up anymore. Look at me. I'm growing.
Oh, I'll go out and get you some.
Now, there's two reasons.
Well ah, ........y'know.
Just a little bit of sugar.
I don't think that's what they were talking about Joe!!
Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.
Alright, whoever this is, stop calling me! It's been six months! It's not funny!
See you later.
No I-I-I'm fine.
Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
I think it's winning.
Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice.
Oh I'm so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?
I don't know. But I-I-I know I love you!
Why?
Okay.
Well, I think it's very brave what you said.
That's correct.
For the last time no! Get out! Get out, Joey!
Yes!! I love you! I can't even remember what we were fighting about!
Okay!
Oh yeah! Yeah! Don't worry about me, I'll be fine!
Out of my league. I could get a Brian. If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. Hey, Brian.
Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!
Did they teach you that in your anger management class?
No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen for you.
Mma, Mma, Mmaah
Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.
I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.
So, are we going in there?
Would you put that back on?! Monica's gonna be here any minute!
Dangerous Liaisons.
Althea?! What are you doing?!
You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?
Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?
Yeah I even got a ring. Did you get a ring?
Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now.
That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienist's blouse.
OH...MY...GAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? You didn't tell her we were getting married, did you?
That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight. Maybe there's something in that area.
Oh thanks.
Wow! She looks great. Doesn't she?
I think it's necessary.
I do.
Really?!
Come on Monica, it's our Valentine's Day. Please? Please-please, please?
Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women.
I don't care, she slept with me.
No! No! No! I just kissed her.
Love her! That's right, I...LOVE...HER!!! I love her!! I love you, Monica.
So...
You're right, and I'm sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I won't say another word tonight.
Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?
Yes?
Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I'll stop seeing her?
We said seven!
Of!
Oh my God!!
Arghhhhhh!!
And! They like me more just because I was with ya! I think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey. And Doug wants us to play tennis with them. He's never even talked to me outside of work. Except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club. Strip church. Anyway, I'm gonna go try and find a racquet.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! And you are about to marry a wonderful man! Hey! I'm marrying a dead woman!
Oh, you get used to it.
Is anybody else scared?
Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is.
Ooh, I do! I do! I do!
Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street.
That thing, it's a uhh. . . yeah it's, it's a little flashy.
Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?! No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowers-Think of the money we'll save!! We're not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our wedding be bigger please?
Right here!
Is that your tiny little box, that's too small to put anything in?
Oh well, that's uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!
Well, y'know I'm 29. I mean who needs a savings account.
Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now.
....three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with the American Ballet Theater?!
What in God's name is that?!
Monica and I almost got married last night.
I know, I know, I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop out of her head.
I can't help it!
Fine!
What did you just do?
But we don't know the neighbors.
Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there?
We got some Vap-O-Rub in some places.
Hi, listen, I'm sorry about before. I don't need to have a game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldn't get girls, and now I can 'em-Now, I have you. Not-not that I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, I see women...
Yeah, all right.
And condoms are the way to do that?
Yeah?
Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people.
Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding.
I still can't believe they promoted her to lieutenant.
Shocking! Since you still have the keys.
OK, let's do it. What?
I'm still on London time, does that count?
Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.
Well, you're not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?
Okay, you guys uh, you guys pick first
How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?
Bye.
Y'know, it'll be okay. It'll be okay. Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then we'll tell 'em.
Yeah o-, OK, alright. Doesn't matter, time for Baywatch.
Come on, pick up, pick up! Hello? Transit Authority? Yes, hello. I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus. Yes I do realize that would be a very stupid charact er.
I thought your time ran out.
Hi! I'm Dorf! You're date for the evening. Oh come on! Dorf on dating, that's good stuff!!
All right, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna get shot down. Any advice?
Hey Ross.... bahhhh!
I figured I'd buy those. Pat, I'd like to buy a vow.
Oh. Y'know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn't because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me 'cause, you're really hot! Is that okay?
Well, it is overdue.
Bye! Thank God
Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?
I can do that, I've had 30 years of practice.
Hmm.
Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!
Because that's where Joey gave me some stuff to store that I've never seen before in my life! Okay, that did not just happen!
Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land.
What, no, "Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?"
Oh, okay!
There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!
I could die.
F-hah.... flennin....
What?
Look, when I've been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly, and I'm sorry.
Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?
Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask!
Are you actually saying these words?
Hi.
Why not?!
Congratulations!
He's at a dinner party.
Rach, Rach, we gotta settle.
Hey, look, you're in trouble either way! Okay? If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she's gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go.
Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbianI don't think we need a third...
Let's go quicker.
Joey, why is your cable out?
No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I can't get myself right out of them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and I'm cold, and
Okay, a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I can't get in!
And protected them from a tornado?
Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve.
Stretchy pants! Why, those are the greatest things in the world! If I were you I would wear them every day, every day!
When you're marrying us; that's what you should say.
You mean scared.
Yes. Yes!
You're definitely scaring here.
Count of three?
Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack!
Hey!
Uh-oh.
We heard you play all the way from your apartment!
Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?
Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.
You, move out. Take your fruit, your stupid small fruit and GET OUT!
What?
Oh yeah, I totally agree.
No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!
Is he the one with the beautiful wife?
What, you guys really think that I'm that shallow?
Uhhhaahh.
Says here that a muppet got whacked on Seasame Street last night. Where exactly were around ten-ish?
Gary, I'm here to report a crime.
Well there you have it!
Yes! See you and I have always been like-
Yeah, never cheat on Rachel.
What do you mean?
OK, so at this point, the dealer...
Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think you're chances are pretty good. All right.
Yeah okay, I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them I mean, is it okay if they come visit?
It's throwing and catching!
Okay, one question.
Hey!
Y'know, I can't believe Kathy did this too me. I really, thought that she was the one. I tell you what, from now on I'm never getting out of this chair, ever! Okay? From now on, this chair is the one! You wanna what else is the one? My sweat pants!
And no one touches the air around the TV!
Well this is great! I'll give you a call! We should do it again sometime!
Whoa, she's pretty.
Yeah, well I don't think you can make that statement, unless you've been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.
Bye.
You said...
Okay.
You're right, I'm sorry. "Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..."
That's totally understandable.
Well the duck can swim.
No thanks, Mom!
Hi.
Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.
So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.
You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.
I don't know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. She's saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to Dollywood.
Oh since forever! I used to go all over town listening to bands!
I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OH...MY...GOD.
Hey, that was really good!
Takin' that with you, huh?
Okay, it's not a guy, all right, I know her.
All right, we haven't had sex yet. Okay, what's the big deal? Y'know? This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to the next level.
Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.
Yes, this, this was pleasant.
Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."
Yeah! All right! You go first.
Oh-I don't know.
Fears and Pet Peeves.
Pheebs! We have to take you to the hospital now!
Could've been a peach.
...betrothed couple.
Could I be more sorry.
Really.
Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?
Oh my God!
Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie's made some new friends.
Oh, hey.
Monica's pregnant.
Okay! Okay! Okay! Oh God, I thought... Wait a minute, I-I can do this. I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. And if you'll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. Monica, will you marry me?
Richard! No one supposed to know about us! See I, did it again.
In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
Oh good, okay, I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore. So you win, okay? Here! Pheebs? Flying a jet? Better make it a spaceship so that you can get back to your home planet! And Ross, phone call for you today, Tom Jones, he wants his pants back! And Hornswoggle? What are you dating a character from Fraggile Rock?!
Yeahhh. I'm tellin' ya something, that ah, first smoke after nap time....
When did I try to give you money?
Oh-ho-ho-ho-no! No! No switching! No sharing, and don't come crying to me! Ha-ha-ha! I may just sit here and have my cake all day! Just sit here in the hallway and eat my...
To Monica!
Okay, but after that, we're shootin' some pool.
Sure.
Y'know what, pretty good.
Oh, that's cool. Then I'll just bring them both over.
Okay.
The reason we haven't told them we're together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! Yes, the groom-No! Not the groom!!
No?
Well see now that I can see crying over, but Bambi is a cartoon!
No. No! No! No!
Unfortunately that is correct.
All right.
Me? No. You?
In the game room!
Oh that's so sweet! I want to show you something too!
Well it you don't know that, then I don't want to do this with you.
Yeah... Bunny-rabbit.
Why would I be mad?
You know it?
Hello.
I happen to know a Fun Bob.
All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?
Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames.
Oh, y'know what, I'm gonna be okay, you don't have to throw a party for me.
Yeah?
I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now? Og-ee-op, I'm not asking for me, I'm... I mean... No, I'm-I'm not gay, I'm not asking you out. I'm not-I'm not-I'm not gay!
I had one.
All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?
He's taking off her coat!
Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?
Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him. Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on.
Done.
Okay.
You really like it?
All right, well I'm gonna put my sweats back on.
Can I sleep on your couch?
You wanna play?
Hey, come on, give me a break, I'm out on a limb here.
There just don't happen to be any women in our games.
Yeah all right. Okay, good night guys.
Y'know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs...
How do you not fall down more?
Sure. And listen, thanks for doing that for us, by the way.
All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?
Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap
Guys are signing over their 401-K's to me?
Uhh, that was Joey. He's running a little late, he says he's sorry.
Forget it! Okay, I'm not giving up my bachelor pad for some basketball seats!
Then it's okay!
Yeah, I'm not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.
Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting.
Alright I'll tell you what, I'll play you for it.
Alright, I'll tell you what, you call the couch and then, and then we'll call the couch, and we'll see who it comes to.
Oh, will you give me the thing.
Crazy bitch.
Okay! Okay! Everybody down! Everybody down!
Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.
Eh!
I know, I still am one of these.
Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY.
Oh, how well you know me...
Because I'm cooler.
Condoms, dude!
Okay, is this lamp in the same place?
Phoebe knows about us!
Help!
Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.
That's a good idea. I wonder where I could get a basket of porn...
That's true!
During this time...are you, are you still my best man?
Bye, Pheebs!
You see you can't tell which one is which either, dwha!!
Right.
Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother's not going to punch me. Are ya?
What happened?
Oh, come on, there's a rest stop right up there! Come on, I really have to goooooooooo.
Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
Okay. But it is officially nighttime.
I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting divorced. I'm such a grown up.
Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.
Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
Y'know, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know you're up there every night, you're naked, touching, kissing.
Hey.
I'm going to the bathroom now.
He took my joke, he took it.
Oh no-no-no-no!
It's like 'Night of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.'
Oop!
Ooh! Yes! Okay! Here's what we do, we-we forget it happened.
Me too.
Shut-out!!
Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.
Clunkers?! Oh my god!
There's no back to this couch!
Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
Not like that, I won't! Kip would have liked the birds!
The man's got a point.
Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it.
Okay.
You can tell us.
No reason.
Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how 'bout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours?
Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?
See? Now, that's why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.
Oh o-, OK man.
Hey.
It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him.
No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate, Momma's Little Bakery. I feel terrible, I'm a horrible, horrible, horrible person.
Hey.
Are you all right?!
So you uh, want to do something tonight?
I'm getting dressed.
You know, I mean, you can't tell your parents you were fired because they'd be disappointed.
I got it! Scotch... tape.
Score.
She answered.
I don't know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office.
Okay.
That's okay Pheebs, we're not having a party or anything, so you don't have to get us...
Aww, I love you so...
Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay, I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth.
Just coffee! Where are we gonna hang out now?
I'm not Jewish, so...
Phoebe Buffay In Buffay The Vampire Layer.
Hey!
No-no
Sorry.
Hey, Pheebs!
So you understand, I'd feel a lot more comfortable if you didn't tell people what happened. Y'know, I'm a little...I'm a little embarrassed about it.
Yeah, I heard you and Rachel talking.
C'mon, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy, Huh? Huh? Huh?
But you found the keys to his clothes?
No!
Wait a minute, wait. You're telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn't want you back?!
You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college, Ross used to wear leg warmers!
Wh-wh-why, wh-why, why, why was there kissing!? There should be no kissing!!
Wow! Listen, we had a good run. What was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then!
Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's lunch, who? Ross Geller's lunch, please don't take me. Okay?
Yes, please don't spoil all this fun.
What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio
Joey, Joey. Hey, some girl just walked up to me and said, 'I want you Dennis,' and stuck her tounge down my throat. I love this party.
Marcel?
You got your passport?
Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
Noo! Oh, it's okay, it's okay, baby, baby, baby.
Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!
How about those three pointers?
Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.
I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y'know? But I have to trick him into taking it so I won't hurt his pride.
No.
Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not.
No-no, I don't think you heard me. Are you ready to party?!
Really?! That's what you heard? You said that?
So I got ya something.
I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!
Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...
Okay.
Oh-ho, yeah!
And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard.
Well, actually it's a hockey team, so it's angry Canadians with no teeth.
Never!
Huh.
Na, forget it, it's probably stripped and sold for parts by now.
I was not flirting.
Hey.
Joe?
Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.
Hi. Okay, you're too late okay? Because she's already with our guy.
No, I am.
Really.
Okay...
Well, we're-we're hanging out in here!
Yeah you can do it.
Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?
Hey!
All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing's right. And that's what deathbeds are for.
That's not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.
Okay, well he totally screwed up the punch line. Y'know, it's supposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh.
Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!
No!
Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together.
I can't sleep now.
Umm, this is nice.
Hey!
I'm not gonna mess it up.
Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles.
For camp!
I am pretending.
Your just, your just clearly not familiar with our young persons vernacular. See, when we say dad, we mean buddy. We mean pal.
Sorry Phoebe.
Oh, I'm fine about my problem now, by the way.
Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor.
I'm tellin' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain.
You built a fort didn't ya?
And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something. Okay? Something huge!
...it was like the Algonquin kids table.
Hey guys, what are you doing?
What?
A woman's
What?!
Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole in that door.
We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone. We didn't think we could make it.
The sheep.
Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love.
You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!
We can't accept this.
Ok, ok, you can be shirts and I'll be skins. I'll be skins. Hey, how you holdin' up there, tiger? Oh, sorry, when my parents were getting divorced I got a lot of tigers. Got a lot of champs, chiefs, sports, I even got a governor.
Next time?
Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey.
No, we'd just like to close them.
Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.
Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.
Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get.
Hey, Rach, can I get...
Do I ever.
You're not a dad. You're not a dad.
What a sweet story.
I told you I should not wear this color.
You ready?
Yes, we don't get married unless there's a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight then there's a definite sign that we should get married.
The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell.
Hi.
That was so lame.
I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the "new thing you do that day!" And it starts right now!
You don't like that show?
Hi!
Well you know that thing you said before, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued.
I was shrieking... like a Marine.
I know, I know, but you're gonna have plenty of chances. There are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over.
Well what... Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go over there; I'm gonna kick his ass! Will you help me?!
Well, you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads.
Y'think?
If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?
Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.
All right! Let's do it!
Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?
Wait a minute, wait a minute, you don't like the guy Rachel's dating? Well, that's odd.
Ah sure. What's in 'em?
It's a great idea.
Yes, I realise that.
: What do you need, what do you need?
Well.... it is amouz-ing...
Oh, aaaah!
Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didn't get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
Rach...
And I don't wanna say this, I don't you guys to hate me, but uh, I don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go. Oh my god!!
Okay!
Whose is it?
Umm, yeah.
I so am.
Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
We have to leave for New York in an hour.
Oh, yeah, sure, it's not mine anyway. It can with the pants.
I think so. Yeah, get off me.
Ah, finally an explanation.
Ok, they're coming, shhh.
Oh yeah, there-there she is!
Yeah, alright.
Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot.
Oh, hey guys!
...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
I'm talking about you. You big, big freak.
Ohh, that's a good one.
Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.
Oh it's always nicer to here than, "Aw crap! You again!"
Why not?
Well it's just my entire family was run out of Scotland by...Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.
And he's not speaking metaphorically.
Ok, all right, look. Let's get logical about this, ok? We'll make a list. Rachel and Julie, pros and cons. Oh. We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and I can use different colors for each column.
All right, should we just, should we just get married? Y'know? I mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it.
I am now!
It's not charity, Joe...
Phil.
Okay, a little announcement, a little announcement. I've decided that my best man is, my best friend Gunther!
Sweet mother of all that is good and pure.
Okay.
If I broke up with you, I'd miss you.
Joey, no means no!
Hey! Hi! You uh, ready to exchange gifts?
...Quality, right, great.
Yeah, let's just forget it.
That would be impossible to resist if you weren't all drippy here.
See Joe, not that that's not grrreat! But, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! Y'know, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!
Hey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon.
Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
OK Phoebs, how many do you want?
Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
Is there any chance you didn't see that?
No thank you.
Kill me. Kill me now.
Yup, get ready for the gelatenous fun.
Y'know you, really didn't have to take me to the airport.
Could we be more white trash?
All right. Look, I'm gonna go in here, and you don't buy me anything ever.
Hey, all right!
Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.
Uh Joe, when it's one o'clock in the morning and you don't come by? That's okay!
And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?
I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . Hi!
So what are you going to do?
But we should take it.
Knock, knock.
Well that would be nice. I'll go get the lotion.
Um, we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for something...
Don't worry.
Look, Monica...
...He's in.
Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something.
Y'know, I knew something like this was going to happen.
Whoa, snowing out there?
Yeah, I'm not in that.
Huh.
I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesn't matter, I still wind up with this little cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. It's so annoying. Does it bug you?
Yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it.
How about Joey... Pepponi?
And I just want a million dollars!
No! You're the sweetest!
I-kea! This is comfortable.
Sorry, I just...can't sleep. Ooh! Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time I look at that cover I'm like...
Yeah, we were gonna give fifty, but if you guys gave more, we don't wanna look bad.
Okay, okay, here she comes! How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesn't want to get married?
Okay, bye!
So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class.
Yes, yes I am. Err, listen, the reason that I called you in here today was, err... please dont hate me.
Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesn't try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.
Well, we don't want that.
Joey!
What are you doing out there?
Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.
Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.
Look you have to help me out here. I thought we had a deal. I thought by the time...
No!
I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride.
Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.
Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but I'm...
Ross, it's just a sandwich!
Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.
Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how I could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth.
7:15. Watch doesn't work.
Ok, so let me just get this straight. So we're uh, strictly talking about the middle?
Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Oh. Oh, God!
Shhhhhhhhh!!! I'm sorry, I thought maybe I'd make some warm milk and it would help me sleep.
Hmm.
And then he did.
All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'
How much did I love The King and I?
Bad London!
Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
What's going on?
Joey, can I talk to you for a second?
Oh yeah? Joshua, give me a call sometime, guys like you never go out of style-what did you throw away?
Alright, what have we learned so far?
Like?
Actually, I don't like martinis.
Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants. If y'know what I mean.
See now it feels like Christmas!
Can you figure out what I'm doing?
Yeah.
Feelings, such strong feelings.
Oh.
Really?!
Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? All I said was that uh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, he should've pushed me off of the bridge.
Oh what is it honey, you need some tea? Some soup? Oh-ohhhh!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!
Ok, that's Eric.
Well the vet seems to think that's she's becoming a rooster. We're getting a second opinion.
Hey.
Well, ye, yes, actually, but, uh, they were my Aunt Edna's, and there were three of us in there.
What? What? Why?!
I don't want to say.
All right.
They have that on the napkins at the club.
Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.
Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.
Because I'm in love with Monica!!
I am only one man! Okay Ross, time is up!
What? That's terrible!
Joe...
And I'm cute too.
It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable.
We have to assign heads to something.
I'll catch you guys later.
C'mon, we're great together, why not?
Why? What happened to him?
Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream.
Yes! Yes! A thousand times, yes!
You-you do?
Well, you do want all that stuff, right?
All right, let's get some perspective here, ok? These things, they happen for a reason.
The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.
She has a real name.
Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!!
OH MY GOD!!!
Oh-ho, come here. Listen, you are one of my favourite people and the most beautiful woman I've ever known in real life.
Wow!
Yes. Okay, there's this one guy, Patrick, I think you're gonna like him, he's really nice, he's funny, he's a swimmer.
Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little Blackjack?
That's right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!
Okay.
Yeah, that's kinda a relief.
Cupping.
I'm sorry!
Alright, we're gettin' closer.
Y'know what, I can handle it, handle's my middle name. Actually it's the ah, middle part of my first name.
Well, actually just one birthday flan.
What?
Oh, that's OK, we'll figure something out.
No! No! No! No--one can beat me.
I'll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.
Hey!
It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very happy were gonna have all the sex.
Well, what if all my stuff was here?
It's kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing.
Hey! Do we have a baby name yet?
Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. Chan and Jan Forever.
Right.
Thanks.
Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks.
OK. Brake left, gas right?
Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?
Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!
No!
Y'know what would work?
Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?
That was amazing.
You did look like an idiot.
Ohh, she's-she's not really my type.
Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence...
No-no, he's not back yet, but he'll be here any minute. So uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?
Happy New Year!
Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!
We can't do that that's insane. I mean 'A' he could wake up and 'B' y'know, let's go for it.
Listen can you guys uh, speak up, it's harder for us to hear you when you lower your voice.
Because that's the only part of you he can see when he's on the table!
Me too!
Exactly.
