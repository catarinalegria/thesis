Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.
No! No! Not, Paris.
What are you doing?
Yes!!
We don't, really.
He's got nothing!
About what?
Why not?
Well, I just...
Yeah! No! No! No! Don't fall asleep! Okay, I am going to make you some coffee. And I probably won't spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor.
Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?
What we did last night was....
The abridgment.
I need to talk to you, it's urgent!
Okay.
You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!
Yeah, but I'm, I'm so much faster...
Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year.
More coffee over here, please!
Come in!
Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I just stopped talking!
What are we gonna do?
Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't serve donuts. Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? I think I can come up with something better than that.
It was working until you showed up, you big tree! I mean, this isn't fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other! And this is all just been one stupid mistake! I was gonna propose tonight.
Okay, well I won't uh, worry about this anymore then.
I hear ya. But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!
Oh, good job Joe.
Hello! Little ones.
Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!
I couldn't do it.
What?!
Fun's over!
You got it. Good woman! Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
NO! No, I'll take that for ya.
Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
Okay.
By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall.
Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she's-she's smart, and funny, and gets you.
Hey! I'm sorry! That- where are you going?
He's coming into the audience. He's coming into the audience.
Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats.
I can't believe she's married.
Eh!
Thank you Helen, that'll be all.
I am here, on my knees, holding up these couch cushions as a symbol of my sorrow and regret, much like they did in biblical times. Though you may haveth anger now. . .
Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.
Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game.
What?
I'm still on London time, does that count?
Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
Yup, get ready for the gelatenous fun.
Hey that's what I tell girls about me.
She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.
Hey, man. What's up?
I wanna quit the gym.
Noo!
Good night.
And I just want a million dollars!
I am pretending.
Uhh, Joey's grandmother is right there.
Uh, two larges, extra cheese on both. But listen, don't ring the buzzer for 19, ring 20, Geller-Green, they'll let you in, OK. If you buzz our door, there's no tip for you. OK, thanks. Pizza's on the way. I told you we wouldn't have to get up.
Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go.
Rent?
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... Did I say that out loud?
Before you say anything, have we got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner!
Who was it?
Yeah.
What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?
I know I am.
It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.
Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big
Alright, OK, alright. But if we put on spandex and my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm goin' home.
Well it's very unsettling.
Big bullies!!
Yes! Ross, you have to stay!
Here.
Well we could just stay in and cook for ourselves.
Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards.
Oh my God! You-almost-gave-me-a-heart-attack.
Okay.
Your liking it, huh?
Y'know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?
Huh.
Oh yeah, you got the big TV. We'll be over there all the time. . . except when we are here.
I'm hangin in. . . and a little out.
Joey, be a pal. Lift up my hand and smack her with it.
So, Spock actually hugs his father?
All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this.
And twenty-five it is.
'Cause it's gross.
What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.
Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street.
Ahhhh-I'm not going to call you.
Boy did we make friends with the wrong sister!
Who did you originally want to hook up with?
No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth. Eh-uh-are you okay?
I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic...
Okay.
Oh my God, how did you do that?
Why are you screaming and hugging?
Y'know what? It's gonna be okay. Y'know what? She's probably not gonna even want to come.
When'd you meet her?
Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
Would you put that back on?! Monica's gonna be here any minute!
Pierce Brosnan?
Who are those people?
Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.
Listen can you guys uh, speak up, it's harder for us to hear you when you lower your voice.
Hey, how 'bout it? You, me, Saturday night?
Chelsea.
Yeah.
So you might say, it's a magic ring.
Where is she, Where is she? Oh, hey, I have a question, where is she?
Op, op, I'm convinced!
'Cause it's-it's not his last name.
OK, I'm gonna get some more coffee before the pinching and eye-poking begins.
Nice!
Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?
Oh, yeah. Uh, no you can't have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If you thought that you were going to be cold, you should've brought your own jacket. But uh, other than that, are you okay? Are you okay?
The cushions are the essence of the chair!
Hey!
Well the package says you have to uh, constantly keep it moving. Stir and drink, stir and drink, never let it settle.
Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.
Hey.
An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didn't wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!
That's not really important right now. What is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just don't feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.
Do we have to?
A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
I did! But the store wouldn't take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?
A woman's
Okay! Listen, I'm gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent.
Sorry Phoebe.
Hey!
Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.
Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'
C'mon, we're roommates! My eyes!! My eyes!!
Yes, yes, we had the sex.
Hey.
All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?
In the game room!
Yes, back then I, uh, used humor as a defense mechanism. Thank God I don't do that anymore.
What?
Why not?
Hey!
Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn?
Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.
Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.
That.
Fine.
You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool! I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing. Anyway we're talking about your dream. I love you. Your dream?
So, what are you gonna do?
Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there's nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening.
Don't worry about it. I'm taking care of it tonight.
Would you come on! Come on! Thank you.
Nope, not under here!
Okay, fine, $300.
Okay.
Joey, a woman just stuck her tounge down my throat, I'm not even listening to you.
Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!
Yeah so, Tuesday?
So, rocks.
Hm-hmm.
Ahh, I believe my exact words were, 'Flaign,en - sten'. I mean I didn't know what to say, how do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator?
No-no, I mean what, what's this about your new place?
But the Kit-Kats are all right?!
Oh, is that against the rules?
I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick!
It's my joke.
Well, you owe me one, big guy.
Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love.
It's a nickname, I'll explain later.
Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.
No! No! No! No--one can beat me.
Hi, oh hi.
Did she freak out?
And then Joey remembered something.
Okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag.
Well you might if it were anything like 7!
No!
Yeah, I'll go get one.
And condoms are the way to do that?
You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting.
Oh, you're-you're going?
Yeah, it's beautiful.
Uh Kathy, with K or a C?
Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!!
What? What? What?
This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.
Okay umm, before I meant you I had really little life and I couldn't imagine growing old with...
Maybe, she doesn't hit him all the time.
Well, you're welcome. And tell them we're really glad they're coming.
Yeahhh. I'm tellin' ya something, that ah, first smoke after nap time....
Well, I am drinking lots of cups of coffee because I'm exhausted! Because Joey started snoring!
Monica, I think you've gone over to the bad place.
And I am not blah, I am a hoot!
I said art lover.
You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli.
Oh, it's okay. I don't...
Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.
Okay.
What's this?
I know.
Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum!
Okay, okay, a little announcement, I just want everyone to know that the position of my best man is still open! And uh, so is the position of the bride.
Yes, Bunny?
Ah! Ahh!! Ahh!!
....three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with the American Ballet Theater?!
So I got ya something.
I'm good.
Oh! That's great, they haven't seen the place since I moved in!
I'm still on London time, does that count?
What if I had had the guts to quit my job? I'd probably be writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny. But my job's fun too! I mean tomorrow, I-I don't have to wear a tie.
Okay. Bye.
Way to be cool, man.
Well, your kind of sitting in my seat.
Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! The Blowfish!
That, that's what's stupid.
Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?
Hey.
Alright I'll tell you what, I'll play you for it.
Hey!
Ross!
Well it's not flexed right now!
Monica.
Depends on what you mean by we.
Are you serious?
Seven times!
I know.
Two hours, that lasted!
Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didn't I wouldn't have a shot?
And this- is my reward!
I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride.
What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.
Ehh.
Don't go.
Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesn't mean anything.
Well, that's the best kiss I've had with anyone I've ever met in a men's room.
I'm sorry man, there's never a good time to stop catching on fire.
Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo.
I know, but just let me say it.
Yeah, just leave me alone for a while.
What?
No reason.
I have the lung capacity of a two year old.
No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.
There you go!!
I'm not getting into this again!
What's an identical hand twin?
Ring dammit, ring!
Nothing!
Hello. Hi, Janice! Can you hold on for a second? Okay. Okay, what do I do?
No!
Is this a service you're providing me?
What, what's what you mean?
Well, she looks the exact opposite of that.
See that'll stop when you pick up the phone.
Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?
Dog grooming huh? Okay, just don't make my tail too poofy.
No. How are ya Paul?
Okay, so when do you want to go?
Come on Chloe! Finish up with your customer first. Come on Chloe! Come on Chloe!!
Hey Mon, how's it going?
Uh-huh.
Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!
Hey!
Don't do it.
Nah, Phoebs, that's the guy that comes in the frame.
What?! I'm Chandler! Oh, that's Richard!
Yeah!
Ooooh.
Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone?
No, no, no, no, no!
Ho-oh, he's gonna get some! Of the glare from the streetlight out of his apartment. Y'know so umm, he's closed the drapes there so he can have a nice, pleasant conversation with your little sister. Well, I'm off to bed!
Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.
Wow umm, calm down.
...And what did you bring?
Hey, I didn't make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500. Don't get to excited because that's not gonna happen unless you get-No way!
Eh, somebody's in a good mood!
Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica that's as good as garbage?
Did she call?
Hello children!
Okay.
You're kidding.
Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!
I hope she throws up on you.
Ohh, yeah.
And uh, you don't have a mustache which is good. I'm Chandler; I make jokes when I'm uncomfortable.
What time is it now?
And monkeys can't write out prescriptions.
Well then maybe you shouldn't go.
I've found.
Well, I think you should seriously consider the marriage thing, give Rachel another chance to dress up like Princess Bubble Yum.
Oh, I'll go out and get you some.
Well?
See, I'm not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?
You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?
Nothing.
Ehh, you're just liquored up.
I don't know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.
Wow!
Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I don't do porn.
Pregnant Woman Slays Four?
Well, she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You can understand that, right? Guys? Guys?
Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper.
People do stupid things when they're upset.
Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn't come yet.
Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please?
Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.
Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?
You didn't think I used to wear glasses, right?
Hey, yo.
Oop!
Well, never say never but y'know probably uh yeah, never.
What?
Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?
Well, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still be living with him.
Well, I just thought it'd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.
Oh you got a wedding dress? That's great!
Hey, why don't you wear those earrings I gave you?
I'll take her back tomorrow.
Hey!
Okay.
Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkin' out the Chan-Chan man!
Well, that's what we said about Joey...
You gotta do it, man.
But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, y'know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, she'd be surprised!
No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!
Oh yeah, I should probably call them.
Well, I try to y'know, squeeze things. Are you okay?
More importantly, was I any good?
You look beautiful. Is this new?
Sure. And listen, thanks for doing that for us, by the way.
Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot more interesting.
Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our relationship.
What?
Oh no-no-no, that's not-No-no-no!
Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?
That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her.
That's laughter.
Well, I ended up telling her everything.
Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?
Out loud?
You are, you're gonna leave me like this?
Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.
Yes.
Hey!
Yes, Janice. Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?
I don't know. But I-I-I know I love you!
Hi! Bye!
...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?
Gotcha!
No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading.
So take care.
See, that's why I could never be an actor. Because I can't say gig.
Is he the one with the beautiful wife?
Actually, it's Miss Chinandolor Bong.
Ha-ha-ha--enh-enh. I'm so glad you guys are all here! My office finally got wrinkle free fax paper!
I'll take one. Sometimes I like to hold stuff like this and pretend I'm a giant.
Really? Wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.
That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.
Princess Leia in the gold bikini.
How can she be great if she's from Poughkeepsie? That joke would've killed in Albany.
Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.
OK, I don't, I don't mind the last pound. OK, in fact I kind of like the last pound. OK, so don't make me do anything that I'll regret.
Okay, it's not a check. They're saying your health insurance expired because, you didn't work enough last year.
Is this because of the burrito thing?
Hey!!!
Hi, Nina. Come on in.
American Express?
I'm not a dropper!
Your pants!
It's not gonna be exactly like last time.
I'm up! I'm up, I've gotten up now! Anybody ah, want anything?
Here in Chelsea.
Yeah, that'd be much worse than being 28, and still working here.
Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, it's the only chance to see New York.
You are aware that she's not a monkey, right?
Yep, pretty much.
That's true!
We heard you play all the way from your apartment!
You know, I think I might just.
Hey.
I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay.
Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex!
I can't believe she can out run you man!
Yes, we do. But, we have to change first.
Hey.
Hey, what did your agent say?
You have done enough!
Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one's free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one's free.
Where's Monica?
Multiple, so many paper cuts.
Sure!
Nooo!! She's really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!
Okay.
Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.
Hello? Hello?
Are you serious?
We're notwe're not saying anything.
Eh?
Smooth.
If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I'll be Crazy Man with a Snake, yknow. Crazy Snake Man. And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. "Run away from Crazy Snake Man," they'll shout!
Is that Joey?! Let me talk to him!
You made pottery?
Yeah, not bad right? You know what, Monica's gonna be working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know what else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who wouldn't wanna live with me?
I don't even know the man. Okay? We're not the close. I haven't seen him in years.
Oh that's all right fellas, I saw a kitchen this morning - on TV. Stop talking. OK.
Hey, does anybody need anything copied? I'm going down to the Xerox place.
Well, this is much better.
Okay, one...two...
Are you aware that you're still talking?
Ross is wearing leather pants! Does nobody else see that Ross is wearing leather pants? Someone comment on the pants!
Congratulations.
I know you probably don't want to go out with me, y'know because I make too many jokes and I've never been in a serious relationship and I guess I'm not technically a "doctor..."
Hey, how was your breakfast with Hillary?
It's not charity, Joe...
Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, they can meet Krog!
Uh, could you leave me one?
All right.
All right! Fine! I'm going. But when I get back it's chair sitting, and I'm the guy who's....sitting in a chair!
Okay. And it's not just chicks y'know? It's all kinds of other animals!
Man, this is...
No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...
Yeah, she's dying... Of a cough apparently.
Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really happened' thing?
Alright. "It was summer, and it was hot. Rachel was there. A lonely gray couch. 'Oh, look,' cried Ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. The end."
Art lover!
Okay!
What's it about?
Phoebe, it's me. You can tell me anything.
Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!
Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY.
Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?
Hey!
Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?
No I didn't!
I'm not gonna mess it up.
Oh my... God?
I think you smell great!
I saw you checking me out during the game last night.
Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.
Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It's the oldest game!
Yes, but I-I uh, don't have too.
Nothing, except tell you, uh, I think it's wonderful how much energy you have.
Wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns.
Ahhh.
Okay. I'm gonna get the ring! I'm gonna get the ring! I'm gonna go find her and I'm just going to propose!
No! No! I support you 100%! I just didn't, I didn't get it right away. Y'know now I'm caught up! Identical hand twins! It's a million-dollar idea!
How do you figure that?
Refill?
You're not even giving them a chance!
That's-that's my nubbin.
Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something.
Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac's sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe's friends with Rachel. And that's the trail, I did it!
Do you wanna?
Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding...
That's just a lot of big talk, y'know.
'Kay!
I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already?
That's a good idea. I wonder where I could get a basket of porn...
It was terrible. I fought with my colleagues y'know, the entire time. Are you kidding with this?
Hey!
What are you doing?
Oh sweet Moses.
Hello.
Isn't that what happened with you and the bride's maid?
Mrs. Braverman must be out.
See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the Law & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!
I'm sorry. If you ask me, I'd move in with him.
Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means we're unhappy forever. Sound good?
That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!
F-hah.... flennin....
All right listen, I have to go to the bathroom, but if the place with the big fish comes up again. I'd like know whether that's several big fish or just one big fish.
Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.
Well, the heart wants what it wants. I'll see you later.
No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who's going like this...
You don't turn and slide, you throw it out! I'm tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!
Bye.
It's a sock bunny.
No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they are.
So is he housetrained or is he gonna leave little bathroom tiles all over the place? Stay. Good, STAY! Good fake dog.
No! Her boyfriend Richard!
Well, it's not like I went to Spain. I went to the bathroom, you knew I was coming back.
Monica's pregnant.
Yeah, we really missed you guys.
Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush.
What've you been up to?
Why two?
Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?
Oh, it's a website, it's the, uh, the Guggenheim museum. See, she likes art, and I like funny words.
I don't sound like that.
Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?
Oh, hello Rachel.
No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!
Without me?!
Wish it! Hi. Hi, I-I was just sitting over there, and uhh, Chandler. My name is Chandler. Did I say that?
I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
Oooo-ooh!
Okay, so he's out of here.
It's Clint. It's Clint!
Wherever! I've got like 20!
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm trppd in an ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr.
Toootal chick-flick.
I'm sorry, who?
Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.
Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's lunch, who? Ross Geller's lunch, please don't take me. Okay?
Hey!
Okay, here you go. I have two queens, what do you have?
Oh, I see. I thought you just really, really liked your new couch.
Wellll?
So is your apron. You're wearing it like a cape.
Well, aren't we Mr. "The glass is half empty."
Heads it is.
This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.
Hmm, let's see if it comes up this time.
Yeah. We're doing the right thing, right?
Where?
Okay...
Alright you guys are off to party number one and you, you are off to party number two Alright fellas, let's keep it movin', let' keep it movin.
Hey! You okay?
Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you...
It is so good to see you!
Because that's where Joey gave me some stuff to store that I've never seen before in my life! Okay, that did not just happen!
No, it's not! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monica's face when I gave it to her, y'know? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye. Look, this is the most important thing I'm gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure it's perfect.
I do not hate Ross!
Not if I kiss you first.
So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.
Oh, I'm Ross. I'm Ross. I'm too good for the Hut; I'm too good for the Hut.
No, ten o'clock.
I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently. It's called being a good conversationalist. Watch. Say something.
Okay, so that's it, everybody knows! It's official, we're moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?
Oh, uh, he's not here right now, uh, I'm Chandler, can I take a message, or, or a fishtank?
What?!
Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so...
What does she do?
Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?
Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it.
No-no-no-no!
Yeeeeahhhh.
Oh yeah.
Well, it'll probably slow it down at first but, once I get used to the extra weight, I'll be back on track.
Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done.
Good! I haven't smoked yet today, I feel great, and-and-and confident, that is a stunning blouse.
Three!
Love her! That's right, I...LOVE...HER!!! I love her!! I love you, Monica.
99...100! Ready or not, here I come! All right, let's go over the concept one more time.
Oh my God! Who's gonna watch that?!
I like this girl, okay, I seriously like this girl, you now how sometimes I tend get a little defended and quipy...
Okay, but this is the last time. With a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there. Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick--chickeeeen.
So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
I think it's the dying cat parade.
What?
Ok.
Okay, so this time I won't quit!
Yeah, baby!
No, it's... fancier than a pimple. Look Ross, why don't you just go see a...
It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.
Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?
Okay, how many of that girl are you seeing?
Okay!
Weird world. Your kids?
Monica and I are engaged.
Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!
No! Ok, this is not good. You are a guy. Ok? This is a guys place. If you let this go, you're going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff.
What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
No. No. We're not gonna do that, y'know why? Because its not an even trade.
That's so funny, because I think I just did!
How?
Okay, okay, here she comes! How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesn't want to get married?
Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him! I wanna talk to him!
Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed.
Pheebs?
Okay!
Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursday's was just our thing man!
Yeah?
Y'know, you'd think I would've.
Me? No. You?
You bet I did, Ben, put it there! Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small! Ho, ho, ho!
Right here!
Well, I think it's very brave what you said.
Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here?
Oh my God, introduce us!
Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.
Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?
Okay.
Yes, he is!
And then Tineals.
Oh yeah, that looks good.
I love you!
That was you!
Thank you! All right, I gotta go unpack.
Hey, look, we're on that TV thing!
Yes that was a nice place!
Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we've got reservations at Ja George.
Oh, what's at 8:00?
This teramisu is, is excellent. Did you make it Mary-Angela?
I didn't nail the boxes to the floor.
Staying out of the way.
Uhh, you've had a lot of sex right?
That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie.
There I am!
Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this.
What?
Totally worth it!
Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.
Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.
Wow that's actually pretty cool.
Hey! Honey, can I ask you a question about the Valentine's Day gifts?
Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? I'm going to go over to Joey's.
Hey! Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!!
All right look. Penis schmenis. We're all people.
I was not flirting.
Oh well, not as lovely as you. I mean, I can't believe that you would have a thirty-year-old daughter! And you! I can't believe that you would have a tux that's thirty years old!
At a fake game!!
Well, I don't really know what that is, but let's!!
Oh yes!
No, it's not like, like Phil Spiderman. He's a spider, man. Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but there's no Gold Man.
Chandler.
Why is your family Ross?!
Why?
Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?
Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I'm saying?
Well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with, and the other one can't get mad.
So, you don't think I'm terminal?
There was no fish when she dropped it off.
Do you happen to know what I'm going to say?
Well, it still has to go, right?
OK, I'm officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me man. Joe? Well, I guess Joey went home. Oh and look, there's still one box that I have to unpack.
Joey kept screaming at me, "Do it now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!!" Sometimes late at night I can still here the screaming.
Thank you Rachel.
Yeah, Jell-o just like Mom used to make.
No way!
Ok, well, this was very special.
You're kidding right?
Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
Okay, I'm a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.
Oh yeah, me too, she's so cool and pretty.
Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice.
Uh, yeah, I just got my pick-up sticks back from the shop. Bring your nerves of steel.
Could there be more Kims?
Okay, ah umm, ah, a 8. Ah, a 6?
Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs.
Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.
Crazy bitch.
Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid's pretzel at them.
Do you know what just happened?
Yeah baby!
Hey.
Aww, thanks man.
Oh what is it honey, you need some tea? Some soup? Oh-ohhhh!
All right, hold on! If you win, we give up the birds.
So, basically just a Chinese guy.
Well that would help the pride thing.
Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves winking.
Oh, well, ah... maybe thats because theyre ah... jealous, of us.
Hey.
Y'know, whipped! Wah-pah!
Aw, don't do that
I don't know. It's a bracelet.
Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats.
Oh no-no-no. This is amazing.
Oh no, you see, actually it is.
All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?
Yeah, I'm not sure I can do that.
Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.
I do like that.
What? That's terrible!
Well, either that or uh...
What are you doing out there?
No. No, see when I first meet somebody it's uh it's mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating.
Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?
So-You got in voluntarily?!
So, this isn't over?
Thanks for picking out the earrings man.
You gotta let me slam the door!
I got something for her. It's a book!
Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could get arrested.
Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think you're chances are pretty good. All right.
All right. I thought about it and maybe you're right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.
We're flipping Monica's mattress.
It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out.
What is going on?
B-bye!
What is with him?
Oh, how well you know me...
In a bad way?
That's a low one!
Arghhhhhh!!
Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room.
He's Greek Orthodox.
I so am.
Dee, the sarcastic sister from Whats Happening.
Who are you going out with?
Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break.
Really, bitchin'!
Varrrrrroom! Hey! Watch it lady! Varrrrrrrrrrom! Hey-hey good lookin'! Varrrrrrrrroom. All right, I'll leave. My bed's so boring.
Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
We don't know Bob, ok? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy.
That's patio furniture!
Oh my good God.
Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I'll stop seeing her?
BEND OVER?!!!
Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!
So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?
Count of three?
Hey.
Daaahhhh!
Hi.
Oh, I'm taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer.
Hi, Just Janice.
What gay thing?
I hope you know what I'm giving up for ya, because she's not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean.
Y'know what? We're not sad, we're not sad, we're just not 21 anymore. Y'know? I'm 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!
Hi! I'm Dorf! You're date for the evening. Oh come on! Dorf on dating, that's good stuff!!
Hey, guys, it's after midnight, merry Christmas everyone.
Y'know what would work?
Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.
Umm, how's it going with you guys?
Yes, yes, but did you see who she was dating?
Oh, great. This is just...
Well I didn't think that was serious. Ya know I thought that was just a fight.
Ohh, so?
Joey!
No!
Joey? Got you a Joey Special, two pizzas! Joe? Hello? Damnit! Hello? No, Joey's not here right now, but I can take a message I think. He's still got a chance for the part?! Oh, that's great news! Well no obviously not for the actor who was mauled by his dog. Oh well, that's great. I will give Joey the message. Thank you! Yes! Okay, Mac audition at 2:00. Allergy actor attacked. By dog not flowers.
Well where did she go?
Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold separately.
So ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?!
Hey guys, what are you doing?
You know, you think I would.
Sure, you guys don't have this problem, you're made of wood. Hey!
Well, I-I still think you're very-very nice and very pretty...
Well, look it's been a really emotional time y'know, and you've had a lot to drink. And you've just got to let that go okay? I mean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight!
Uh, what was that?
All right, I took the quiz, and it turns out, I do put career before men. Get up.
'Kay!
So how's it going there in Financial Services?
Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's.
You hear that? We're the guys.
Okay, worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father.
And now you're giving me the message!
Hi! I'm back. Yeah, that sounds great. Okay. Well, we'll do it then. Okay, bye-bye.
Yeah.
Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here for you later. Hey, how about maroon?
Howdy.
Course there, they just call it food.
Eh. I thought that was an alp.
Now why would she say that's embarrassing?
Maybe we should give them some privacy.
Yes!! I love you! I can't even remember what we were fighting about!
Yeah.
Hey!
Who?
It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.
Hey.
Ah-ha, you're not the boss of me. Yeah, you are! Ooh, saucy.
Hey, how'd it go? How'd she like the gift?
Okay, I gotta go to work.
Ok, Phoebe.
Alrighty.
Bob here.
Or Casey.
Well you know, we got to talking and uh, he said he needed a place and I had a spare room.
Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds.
OK.
Y'know what? Forget it! We are just hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.
Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom.
Happy New Year!
Joey, I uh! I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.
Hey, there he is! There he is!
Yeah!
We already knew that!
To my best bud. Thanks best bud.
No!
Hello, Joanna......'s office.
So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.
No!! Okay!! What's with the third degree?! Why don't you just shine a light in my eyes?!
Y'know those big-big uh, road signs that say "Merge?"
Tell me what?
OK, stop.
Hey, do you want this done quick, or do you want this done right?
Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there?
I don't know, y'know. What, what, would you do?
Isn't she cute? No!
Well, it does not ring a bell with me...
It's happened to you?
You know, once youre inside, you dont have to knock any more.
Y'know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because, that's you and I together! Merge!
Thanks.
So are we...friends again?
What's wrong?
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You're not Elizabeth's dad?!
Uh-oh.
I'm gonna call and get off work tomorrow!
Oooh, I'm afraid that does not exist.
Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
Okay.
Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?
Morning, Ross.
That's not funny.
Uh, yeah.
Next time you snore, I'm rolling ya over!
I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.
So this is nice! I wish I didn't have to go, believe me! But unfortunately I have to. Oh uh, by the way, what's the name the girl you're dating?
Hey, I've been honing!
Why?
No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody.
What?
I messed up. Okay? I'm sorry, I really messed up.
Goodnight.
Nooo.
Hey, don't worry. I figure it'll be 2 hours to Phoebe's dad's house, they'll meet, they'll chat, they'll swap life stories, we'll still have plenty of time.
We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone. We didn't think we could make it.
You can be the best man when I get married.
Hi!
Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!
Oh it's always nicer to here than, "Aw crap! You again!"
Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?
Wow! Listen, we had a good run. What was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then!
Really?
See, I told you they don't swim.
Air hole! Air hole!!
Just coffee! Where are we gonna hang out now?
You know when guys hang out they don't just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?
Oh no-no-no!
We have free porn here!!!
Your little men are gonna get scored on more times than your sister.
You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!
Hey, I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and Emily, and I think that's, I think that's really cool.
Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and...
Well she's, she's the kinda girl-Joey was unconscious.
Oh that's not true.
Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.
Oh.
Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see her tonight. Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight.
Ground control to Major Tom! Commencing countdown...engines...on!
I'm doing this because I'm sorry?
Yes, Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please?
What did you guys just do?!
Yeah, me either.
When we were?
Hi!
What?
You hear that! That is her chose, mister I'll let you have her! I win! You suck! I rule all! A mini-wave in celebration of me!!
That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!
I majored in lightning rounds. All right, we're gonna destroy you.
Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really. Nothing.
I don't know, but don't worry, don't worry, because I know how to take a picture now. Okay, see? Look down , look down, look down...
And what does she have to think about? I love her!
Oh. Oh, God!
This isn't one of those uh, y'know "If she doesn't come, we-we don't, we don't come?" Right? Because I already bought my ticket...
No, I have a great idea for a present for her.
OK, what is it about me? Do I not look fun enough? Is there something. . . repellant. . . about me?
Okay! Okay! Okay!
Yes. Okay, there's this one guy, Patrick, I think you're gonna like him, he's really nice, he's funny, he's a swimmer.
Look, forget it. We tried, but Phase Three is a lost cause, Okay? Those strippers were insanely hot, and I couldn't picture myself with any of them.
Bedroom. Bathroom. Living room. This right here is the kitchen, and thanks for coming by, Bye-bye.
Oh totally! Pull my finger.
So I really never get to win anymore?
Okay.
Yeah. Thanks for making me do this.
Well, I don't have to break up with her this time. We're not involved! I'm going to do a pre-emptive strike! I'm going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen!
Before or after you were shot by your own troops?
Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor.
Yeah you can do it.
Ah, I fooled around with Joey's sister. Well, that's not the worst part.
And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place....
Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism.
That's still yours. Okay, now remember it's a surprise party. So, when you go in, act surprised.
Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here.
We got some Vap-O-Rub in some places.
Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, we'd really appreciate it.
So, uh... what do you think it is about me?
Well, you couldn't have looked everywhere or else you would've found her!
Well, you remember Cathy Bates in Misery?
Oh my God.
No!
Forget it! Okay, I'm not giving up the apartment.
To Put the Camera Away!!!
I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.
Well, what did the police say?
They do?
Well, I guess thats why they call it psychology, sir.
Totally.
Stripping!
Say again?
I see.
What are you doing here?
What, you guys really think that I'm that shallow?
You win.
I like her.
Our kids are gonna be fat aren't they.
Hey, listen, why don't we go change in my room?
I don't know, I'm very tired.
Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.
Because of the weekend, we had a fight.
She doesn't know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this morning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. And now I can't even return them, because she choked on the reciept!
OK, this one right here is from me.
Oh the phone! The phone's making sounds! Hello!
Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... ...now I wish I was dead.
Oh, well...
Uh, uh.
I got glasses!
There's a Phoebe on my sandwich!
Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?
What... did you get me there?
Just tryin' somethin' here, ya know.
Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?
Oh, she's sorry! I feel better!
Could you get us a couple of beers?
Oh, I couldn't be happier.
Oh, we could do this all day.
Could I play?
We can't accept this.
Oh no! No! No! No!
You see what I mean.
Condoms, dude!
You mean like for award shows?
Flashdance.
Easy tiger.
Hey, Lowell.
Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away.
Marcel?!
For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.
No one was around to hear that?
I'll go.
Really?!
How could it not matter?!
Okay, I don't think we can turn anymore!
She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?
I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream now, right?
Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?
Guys, guys, guess who I am?!
Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?
Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.
Okay, okay, I tell you what. You roll another hard eight; and we get married here tonight.
Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.
What?
Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...
You have to give 'em something, you know. Okay, now that was Gerston, Santos, and who's the guy with the moustache?
Hello, Chandler Bing.
A hundred and forty-five pounds.
In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.
Ohhhhh!
Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings! Don't cry outloud.
Oh, what the hell is that?
No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.
Me asking is kind of a sign.
Hey! How'd the audition go?
Well, why don't you tell her to stop being silly!
Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?
Hey, big guy, game time.
I don't know. Should we try it?
Yes?
Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.
Okay!
Yes, you got something from the Screen Actor's Guild.
What?
Really.
Well that would be nice. I'll go get the lotion.
Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car.
I can't believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!
Oh, ok, 'cause we never do that.
I don't want to look.
What is the matter with you?
Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!
What?!
Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
Hey, is Rachel here?
I love you. And I know about the baby.
That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?
Hey.
Well, my apartment isn't there anymore, because I drank it.
Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn.
Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.
Okay, there are no famous Joey's. Except for, huh, Joey Buttafucco.
Oh my God that's it, that's the ring! How much is it?
Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You can't offer anything to us!
But, I never left the room!
I don't believe it. The most romantic night of my life and I'm runner up.
So uh, what are you in for?
Y'know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs...
Yeah!
Okay, here is the thing. We have thrown a very formal surprise party for you in there! All of your friends are in there and your parents!
And now I've picked it up again.
... And where's this money coming from?
No, you're the best.
It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. So please wake up so we can do it right!
No, there were two.
Right on! Oh! Uh, but, don't take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez.
Here you go Joe, here's the freshly squeezed orange juice you asked for.
So they're going on dates? When?
And I'm blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it, "Oh Chandler, I just lost myself in the moment."
I'm not in a meeting. I'm right... Whoops.
Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection.
What, like a number?
Hey!
