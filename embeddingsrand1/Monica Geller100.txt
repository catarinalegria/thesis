Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long.
Okay.
Yeah, in-in-in the bathroom.
Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound.
The park huh? A public place.
I'm Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom?
Now?
Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever.
Oh that's great, why don't you tell mommy on me.
What?! You're going out with her again!
Why is it sick?
Anyway, we're really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon we'll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund. What?
Excuse me, where are you going?
Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats! But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend!
Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did.
Please, just a little bit off the back.
Y'know, I love doing crossword puzzles with you honey!
Oh, what about that guy over there? Remember? That is the guy you flirted with at the counter that time.
I know it is the best.
Hey, the man's dog just died.
In.
You didn't know that already?
'Kay, here you go.
No.
Okay, come on, do it one more time!
Would you stop?
Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends? Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?
Not now.
Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?
Hey Maureen! Gosh! Hey uh, Chandler? This is my cousin Maureen.
Y'know what, don't tell us. We'll just wait until Chandler gets home, because it'll be more fun that way.
Joey we know you steal our food.
We're good.
We're sorry honey.
Wow, this really sucks.
So how was Joan?
I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.
Are you sure you wanna do this?
What?!! Gross!!
Do you think he knew I was here?
Really?
Hey, you think, you can keep it another night?
No, if he doesn't like our cookies, too bad, I am not gonna be blackmailed. Look if worse comes to worse, it gets a little warm, we'll call it a theme party.
Yeah, well he's my brother! And plus he drives so slow he could never hurt it.
Y'know, I don't like to brag about it, but I give the best massages!
Oh my.
Well, umm, Walker was looking for this big bus load of kids.... All right, I get your point.
It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.
Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time. Maybe someday, there will be.
Changes?
What?!
Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, "Do you see a future?" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her? Oh my God! You did it already! You married her, didn't you?!
I'm not laughing.
No.
'Cause if you do that means you'd be cancelling it for me, and we're just friends.
You made it!
What?! I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that I can give my flower to someone like him!
You know what, I think it's cute, you trying to be more like Richard.
How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!
No, my eye doctor is Richard! I can't go to him when I don't have a boyfriend!
C'mon. Keeps his fingers to himself and he's always minty fresh.
Okay! Okay! Okay! We'll see you in about 3 to 4 hours.
No! No!
Yep! And lot's of it!
If you're not going then I don't want to go either.
Sweetie, with you it's gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, 'cause you-you guys are in love.
No! Rachel is meeting us here.
Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.
We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret.
Are you serious?
Great!! That's great!
Well, thanks anyway.
See yeah umm, you kinda stole my thunder!
Oh, please.
Because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. I just don't want anything to spoil that.
No, I'm wearing a wedding dress.
You have dinosaur checks?
Hi! If you're calling before Saturday, you've reached Monica and Chandler. But if you're calling after Saturday, you've reached Mr. and Mrs. Bing! Please leave a message for the Bings!
Have you even had a girl up here?
I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a real couple. We don't have to hide.
Oh please, you just want more blue pins.
Isn't that mine?
That was a half an hour?
Phoebe!
Okay, you can not tell Chandler. Okay? That I ran into Richard.
Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic , in Central Park!
It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, "Oh my eye! Oh god, my eye!" I mean, it is so annoying.
See? They're as different as night and... later that night.
Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun! Ohhh!
Oh! So you think I'm a failure!
I don't know how museums work in England but, here, you're not supposed to take stuff.
We had a characturist!
Hey, are you okay?
Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?
Relax. Y'know, she may not even know.
It's umm, it has something to do with transponding.
Why not?
Are you saying that you don't wanna get with this?
Why?
Y'know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I... We just have to get it over with! Y'know, the next time we see them we're just gonna tell them. Okay? That's it.
