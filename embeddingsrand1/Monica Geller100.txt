We're kidding!
Oh my.
Ross, she's 25 years old.
Oh, no no no no no.
This isn't easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If you were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times, I would really...
I don't believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?
That's stealing!
Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long.
Yes. I hated you. I mean I, I, loved you in a 'you're my brother so I have to' kind of way, but basically, yeah, I hated your guts.
Then get over yourself! Grow up!
Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine.
What are you trying on now?
What are you talking about? She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!
Wow. That is not a happy hi.
Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those "healthy, healthy, healthy guys"?
Well, what kind of food is he looking for?
What?!
And you?
Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.
You know what. Tomorrow I'm gonna do your clocks.
You're not on TV.
Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass.
Oh. Thank you. Ohhh, thank you very much. Oh, thank you for coming. Uh, just a second!
All right, umm, we're not gonna really keep it this way though.
Okay.
Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies!
She's my favorite character on DOOL.
Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?
All right, be my guest.
The big hat, the pearls, the little pick handbag.
Hey! Happy Anniversary!
I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it.
Yes you did! You did like a little hop.
Hello?
'Cause I ran into him at the bank, he is still soo cute.
Oh.
Honey, having a heart attack is nature's way of telling you to slow it down.
Thank God! I can't watch him anymore!
Oh my god.
Okay, stop it Phoebe, you're getting me all tingly.
Wait a minute, who told you? You are dead meat.
Awww. But still no.
Okay!
Maybe we should just tell your parents first.
Fine, go have sex.
I love you.
I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect.
No.
You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
What's wrong Phoebe?
I love this friend thing!
Look Julio, someone left their book here.
Oh!!
I know, what about Rachel? I mean how are we even gonna ask her?
I mean they're trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I've been waiting for my whole life.
Oh my!!
Okay, we've been out here for two hours and we haven't seen any stupid comets. Can we go now? I mean, Chandler's getting chilly.
Hey-hey, how goes the dancing? Gay yet?
No it's not! No! No! Now it's about you and Ross getting back together!
Okay! My turn! My turn!
That, you get? That, you get?
Hi Chandler.
Hi, um, I'm gonna need a new set of these forms .
Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I thought that I would give you just a little preview.
Oh, god help us.
Okay. Umm...
Well, what about his family?
Jacket now.
Old?
I wish all guys could be like him.
Okay! Ohhh no!
She's bluffing!
So what. So he drank a lot tonight.
Is your tongue swelling up?
Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier.
So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know they're going at it right on the bathroom floor.
Oh my God, Richard.
Can we just start throwing things in?
What? We took a walk, nothing happened. I can back with nothing all over me.
You really think this is okay?
All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.
I know! It's just that...ever since high school Rachel was the one person I told everything too. Y'know? I miss that so much now. She's my best friend.
Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-that's it, that's it, all right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They're not the right size, they're not Victorian, and they just don't go.
What?
Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother's? Wouldn't they have the recipe?
You sold me out.
I'm quitting!! Woo-hoo! I'm okay!! I'm all right!!
Oh yes! I have it right here, on ice!
Well it didn't!
Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?
Oh, and the newspaper delivery guy.
Stop sending food to our apartment.
No!
Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana.
Okay. Umm, y'know, I don't think, I don't think I told you this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship.
Only if you say his full name.
Well, we're still talking about it, aren't we?
Why don't you just be straight with her? Tell her the truth.
Go! Go! Go!
