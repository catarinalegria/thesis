Ooooh! Wow!! Oh, hi.
From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.
Noo.
Hi Ross!
All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!
So uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight?
Okay. Walked right into that one didn't he?
Hey! Hey, cute jacket!
Men just take out wind?
Jill?
Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me! I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless. You just saved me! You're my hero!
Ugh!
Oh, little 'X's! Great! That makes up for everything!
Okay!
Well, we're a little early, the lecture doesn't end for 15 minutes.
Yeah actually, I think we're gonna take off too. We rented a movie.
Ugh!
Get the hell out of there, y'know?
Oh, I mean she's gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and people will be whispering, "Oh that poor girl." Y'know? Then she'll have to come back here and live all alone.
What?!
