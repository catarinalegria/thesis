Well, do you want to hear what actually happened or Joey's lewd version?
Hi.
You can?
Oh.
What?
Okay!
She's totally right! When we were together, you got all freaked out about Mark and there was nothing going on.
What?
Because, I wanted to hurt you.
Well, I told him I would think about it, but I'm gonna tell him no.
Please, no, go, that'd be fine!
Okay.
Ahhh! Ooh, nice!
You mean, you mean 30 days?
So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
You ah, you didn't say 'Yes' to that did you?
I'll get her.
Oh really? Like what Monica?
Hey!
OK, OK, it's my turn.
