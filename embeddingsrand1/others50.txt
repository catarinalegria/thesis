Yeah, okay, bye.
I'll do it.
Yes! Although, I think we may be seeing a little too much of some people. Aren't you a little old to be wearing a dress like that?
What do you mean? Yesterday you said I was too pretty to pay for stuff!
We've lost visual contact with the suspect.
Awwww!!
Hey! Hi!
What?
Sweetheart, just gimme- gimme another chance, okay, we'll start all over again. We'll go back to Aruba.
Hi.
Please, can't you help me out?
Oh, we were so sorry to hear about your parents splitting up, dear.
Yeah!
No, no, no. What was that?
Oh, who's this little guy?!
Why don't you try to do-
Hi Kim.
What kinda noise?
Oh boy, I just love to sing!
Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.
I'm gettin' back together with my ex-girlfriend.
Yeah.
Hey.
Fine, whatever.
And then we've gotta get some sleep.
I can't believe you thought that you were going to video tape us having sex on the first date!
I know. You're the guy who wouldn't chip in for the handyman.
And Action!
What?
Hmm Phoebe, were you ever in a sorority?
Hang it up! Hang up the phone!!
In a minute. You-you checked today's Post?
I do. I do. I love it. In fact, I think I'm gonna wear it home.
Yeah. Ever since you flashed my badge at me, I kinda can't stop thinking about you. You're the prettiest, fake undercover whore I've ever seen.
I see the head.
Yeah. That didn't work out.
Hey. Listen, I want you to know how sorry I am...
What? So you never went out with an actress before?
Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.
The next tour of the wine cellar will plan in two in-in minutes...
Ohh, its been better. The Annual Net Usage Statistics are in.
Hey! Me too!
So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think?
I'm sorry I... It's just there's no real spark.
Hey, Chandler!
I'm Mrs. Dr. Barry Hunter hyphen Farber.
Listen, I-I-I don't come to this city much so I don't know if you're crazy or this is some kind of street theater, but could I have my keys.
Ross? Ross?
Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if you're given' 'em out.
Ah well, this is the living room.
