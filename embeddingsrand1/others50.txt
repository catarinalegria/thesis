It doesn't really seem like enough to be fate.
I, I don't know.
Aww, look who's being suddenly shy. You can't tell me you don't feel what I feel. Nobody can kiss that good and not mean it.
Well, I wouldn't call her a star, but she's really good. You should check out Inspecther Gadget.
Yeah, that would be great. So I guess umm, good night.
Well, somebody got some last night.
You're welcome.
Oh shut up more! Now, are you friends with Ralph?
You go get that animal outta here.
..a sound Mom and Dad never forget. For this after all, is the miracle of birth.
Which bedroom do ya want it in Miss Geller?
Oh John! Great!
I am so glad that you could come over tonight.
Yeah! C'mon!
You've got panties stuck to your leg.
Neither am I.
Rachel!
Hi.
Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away.
I'm kidding.
Suddenly, I very aware that I'm naked.
Perhaps, uh, the three of us, just could. . .
Also Monday.
More wine, dear?
Hey!
Normally, I would not do it.
Put your balloons down!
Well, you're just going to say no again but...gay porn.
Flexible hours.
No I didn't.
No. But, Monica and I were talking, and-and I was so upset about the hall being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit.
Why? Why?! What's wrong with me?!
Wow!
No that's La Guardia. This is Mexico.
No, no, that was my boss. I have to go.
Welcome to the building. I'm uh, Steve Sarah; I'm president of the tenants committee.
Oh you don't have to be sorry. I'm...I'm obviously kidding. I'm not in love with you. I'm not in love with her. I don't hear coconuts banging together. Yeah, I don't...picture your face when I make love to my boyfriend. Anyway, I gotta go. Eh...kiss good-bye? No? Okay.
No Cobb, as in cobb salad.
Drops!
Hi, Monica.
Rachel is my girlfriend.
If I had one wish, it would be to build a time machine, go back to when I was 7, when Jimmy Hauser had the chicken pox. I would grab that kid and rub him all over my face.
Ohhhhh!
Life partner.
Barley? What kind of party serves barley?
You too.
I think I accidentally used Monica's boxes to keep the water away from the Porsche.
Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you.
Anyway, I'm guessing you hired somebody.
No.
