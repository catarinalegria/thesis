Umm, is Tag here?
It's just hard when I know I have e-mail I can't get!
I want you right here, right now.
Yeah, uh, Joey said I could use your shower, since, uh, Chandler's in ours?
That might be fun.
Nope.
So you still think you, um... might want that fifth date?
It really was. There was this great little pastry shop right by my hotel. There you go, dear.
And for you sir?
Yeah! You're saying, you need to be with someone more mature. Maybe someone with, a license to practice medicine. Or a mustache.
...Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
Chicken or small?
No he, he moved out and I moved in.
Hey, you listen.
Yeah! That's right. Yeah-yeah! Yeah!
See ya Phoebe! Oh and hey, thanks for chipping in!
Hey! Oh, I was just about to leave. I-I-I-I didn't think you were coming.
Well, smack my ass and call me Judy! These are fantastic!
Yeah, I love you. Okay, bye! Hi!
Uh, I gotta apologize for Kara's coffee. Y'know, I feel sorry for it if it ever got in a fight, it's not strong enough to defend itself. Did you hear what I said Bing?
That's okay.
Hey, Phoebe.
Okay, okay, okay. Y'know what, this was just really expensive. And I'll take- this was a gift.
Scotch.
Oh! Oh! Oh! Thank you so much! You don't know what this means to us! Oh!
Uh-huh. Is it dirty?
Shut up! I did not sound like that at all!
You're gonna do what to my clocks.
Just ah...
Stop the bus! Wait! Wait! Wait!
Oh, that was the blind date that I told you about, she called and switched it to today.
Okay.
Cut! Wonderful!
Why the Post?
Give me the dice.
Now, which of you is the father?
Julia..
So, who's the mystery man?
What?
And then after decided to forgive you, seeing you at the airport catching our plane with her.
Uh, I-I-I was hoping to run into you here. I didn't know whether I should call or not, y'know I-I was only in town for a few days. And y'know, I didn't want to intrude on your life or-or anything like that, but I-I really wanted to see you and-but I didn't know if you wanted to see me.
No! That's bluffing. Lesson number one. Let me tell you something... everything you hear at a poker game is pure crap. : Nice earrings.
Cleveland.
....Mindy. Mindy, of course Mindy, it was always Mindy.
Let's get started. Five, six, a-five six seven eight...
Here let me...
I just came for the red-velvet pillow.
Oh no, no, right I shouldn't have said married. Uh, please don't go freaky on me. I didn't mean it. Well, I didn't say it; I take it back!
Is that supposed to be me?
Great!
Ew, this feels very weird.
It-it's really heavy.
Yeah, they wanna see you again tomorrow.
No, I wanna melt it.
Sweethart, but none of that matters if it's too soon for you. It's fine! We don't have to move in together. I just-I want you to be happy
Um-hmm.
That's just the way it is.
Oh, I never could do it.
Noth- I was- I was just saying to my-
I had a really nice time tonight.
Ohh. Ouch.
Alright.
Look I want you, now.
What is taking so long?! I mean whatever!
But they're not here yet!
Five dollars a box.
You're so bad!
Oh, yeah! Right!
Y'know, I don't think I want the lipstick that much. But umm... Oh, would you do me a favor? And umm, would you, would you give Lilly that, please?
All right, fine.
We love you. Buy.
No, I-I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted. I mean you had just moved in.
You're our third call tonight.
You're into hardcore S&M right?
Wow!
Look honey, people get fired left and right in this business. I already got you an audition for Another World.
Last night was wonderful. But I-I can't stay here just for you.
You haven't?
Okay that's fine, I'll walk away. And I'll never bother you again, but only if you tell me Chandler's willing to give you everything I am.
Oh, no!! No, no!
It's time for me to conquer the physical world.
Thanks Phoebe!
...Now what is this about you-you being arrested i-in London? What is that all about?
Yeah?
Okay.
You wouldn't return my calls, you sent back my letters....
What's up?
...and this guy...
Hard day huh? First the medical award, this.
Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar!
Kidney stones! Now, ordinarily Mr. Tribbiani, we try to break up the stones up with shock waves, but they're to close to the bladder now. Which means we can either wait for you to pass them or else go up the urethra...
No! No! I wanna see you take-off.
Well you can split it with another credit card.
Yeah, we have time off and a lot of people are going on trips...
All right. Here's your first baby.
It's like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How 'bout you?
Yep. Pretty much.
Happy?! Is that what I'm supposed to be Vic? Happy?
...No, we hate him.
Would you like my tin-foil hat?
Hi.
Ahhhh! I'm sorry!
Oh my God!
Which is bad, because?
Ohh. Like what?
Look, the only who stands to get hurt is me. And I'm okay with that.
We found your fire alarm in the trash chute.
Sorry.
Hi! Rachel Green's office.
He's the kind of guy you're friends with, y'know? But he's not the kind of guy you date. He's the kind of guy you'd date because you did. Me, not so much.
Sure.
Hi Rachel.
Hmm, Lipson knows huh? Ahh, hello Mr. Opossum, enigma of the trees, upside-down denizen of the night, taunting gravity with...
Keep in mind, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do. Go ahead. This works with any milk carton.
Ah well, it's nubbin. Nothing! Umm. Y'know what, I'll see you later. Okay.
She says it's to dry now and she wants to come back here and explain to you exactly how she wants it.
Alright, so now you're doing this whole book tour thing, how is that going?
Oh.... my.... God.
Gary.
Fellas, these guys were here first.
You do?! Wait, I like umm, the Beetles.
Okay. Will you marry me?
Okay. Okay. Would, would it help if I went over and apologized?
Okay...
Over here Jack. OK. I see, Rachel's coming up the path. Oh doesn't she look pretty. Jack, get this.
Well, relax. If it makes you feel better, I've attended some of the finest medical schools in Central America. Well then, let's take a look at this skin abnormality of yours. Come on, have a seat. Eeh, huh. As I suspected, it's a koondis!
Okay, then.
OH...MY...GAWD!!
Oh, my major was totally useless. I mean, how often do you look in the classifieds and see "Philosopher wanted"?
Oh, you're sweet and cute.
I'll take it all.
This does.
Where can I wash up?
Yes?
You're a grand ol' flag, you're a high-flying flag, and forever in peace may you wave....
Australia, I just moved here a couple of weeks ago.
Oh, somebody's been doing his buns of steel video.
That's Carol with your son!
When are you coming home?
Monica bang!
See, if anyone overheard that, I didn't come off well.
Hey, so what'd I miss, what'd I miss, c'mon?
Well, that was ah...
Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?
Uh-huh. G-good deal.
I'm a little embarrassed.
Yeah, well you'd be better if you just loosened your hips a little.
Put your balloons down!
What?! I can't believe you're trying to stifle me! When just 14 hours ago we figured out that that is exactly what my mother was trying to do to me!
But like how?
Ooh, steer clear of you.
Nobody. I was just practicing.
Yeah?
I've literally never been this happy.
So, all right.
What do you mean?
I'm sorry, I can't talk. I'm gonna go write in my journal.
Sorry, I don't know any Earl.
It's the key to my Porsche. Well, the key to your Porsche.
No.
I'm Ted, and I just moved here a month ago, and New York really scares me.
M!
What did he say?
Ohh, here comes my dad and stepmum. Mister and Misses Geller, this is Steven and Andrea Waltham.
Oh, the water was sooo great! We jumped off this pier and my suit came off.
Rach! Rach!
Adios.
Hmm.
Maybe.
It's okay, Rachel knows.
You know what's really good here, the lobster. What do you say shall I just order three.
Wow. He's strict.
Hey! Hey! Hey! This is 92.3, WXRK, K-Rock for our $1,000 daily challenge.
Thanks for not marrying Rachel.
Monica... Hey Mon, I have a question. Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the fattest man in the whole damn town?
No.
Hi!
That's kinda sad.
Hello, I am Guru Saj--Whoa!! That's supposed to be a duck right? 'Cause otherwise, this is waaay out of my league.
Twenty-four actually.
This should be fun.
Chandler's a girl!
That's about 60 cents.
...I may have only been in therapy for three weeks now dear but...
So, it's great to see ya.
Did you bring the toe?
We have great news!
Yeah, it was.
You gonna slice them up real nice?
I mean hey! I just met you, I don't know you from Adam. ...Only child, right? Parents divorced before you hit puberty.
No.
Yeah, but you can come and visit me. I bet that you could uh, own a few places down there.
Monica bang!
I'm so excited about having Monica come on board with us. Although I do feel bad about having fired chef Emillio, it's like losing a member of the family. Of course, that literally is the case for several of you. Tony, Carlos, Marie, please, tell your father how much we're gonna miss him. Now, I know that Monica has a lot of great ideas for this place, well, you all read the review. So without much further ado, I present to you our new head chef.
Hey pal, are you Joey Tribbiani?
Huh. That's nice.
Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life and I said yeah, I liked her in Splash, a lot, but not so much in- in Wall Street, I thought she had kind of a
Okay, she was here, but she left.
Okay!
Kidney stones!
Hi! My boss let me off early, so I took the train.
I dunno, uh... you just have a-a...
Oh, I totally agree.
Well I'm not gonna stop until I'm the Ultimate Fighting Champion.
Boy I would just uh, I would freak out.
Sure.
No I don't think so.
Joey!!!
All right, let's try one.
Ross play rugby? I don't think so.
I'm uh, considering leaving your father.
No thanks.
I wanted a big wheel. And instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken that you hop around on. It was embarrassing; kids made fun of me. That was a pretty tough year.
Rachel?
Okay, that's great, but can we make it smaller? Can we make it fit on the head of a pin? I love when we make things fit on the head of a pin.
Yeah, I'm movin' to a bigger place. You should definitely take this one.
Yeah, you can't eat that in my car.
Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it's just cruel.
He picked it out of the toy store himself, he loves it.
I've had a really good time tonight.
No, he already knows that he owns everything in the room! He's not finding it out for the first time! So, try it again.
Well I was thinking it would be um, kind of sexy if you wore mine tonight, at dinner.
That's because they are.
Of course, you did. Forgot something else too ya bastard! Well, what about you? You're not feeling left out or anything are ya?
Yeah, well, sorry, Joe. You said let's just be friends, so guess what?
Hi Kim.
Come on, you got the shopping bags and the Sack's catalog.
I know, but it's my job, sweethart!
You-you work at one of those massage parlors?
Okay, I bought a boat.
Hello everybody!
He's gonna go up to the counter with Citizen Kane, Vertigo, and Clockwork Orgy. This is nice.
Oh it's nothing, it just says that you can't sue the city if you scrap your knee or y'know, get your head blown off.
-hard quality. And uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional way, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. Then, uh, that-that-that's when you started yelling.
Dennis.
Don't you point your pants at me! We have no choice! Anywhere that's half-decent would've be booked months ago, Ross don't you understand? This is our wedding I'm talking about.
Here we go gentlemen, here we go! Are you ready? Are you ready? Let's get it on!!
Ditto.
No, it's a water balloon fight! We started it!
Oh no, it isn't! No! I think Barry is seeing someone in the city.
Fruitflies?
I'll be right back. Make yourself comfortable.
I've been thinking about getting rid of it. I was driving it the other day and saw my reflection in a store window. Your mother's right, I do look like an ass.
Joey!
What?
Oh my God!
Well, I just wanted to see where you lived. Now, give me the tour.
Well I just thought...
Here's the Shelly Siegal stuff from December.
Chandler?
So I got it in the junior miss department, big diff. Anyway check it out man, it's gonna make a hell of a conversation piece at out next cocktail party, huh pal?
I love that idea!
Yep.
Really Mr. Geller, you don't have to do this.
No-no I heard! I'm just sorry.
Nobody knows his name. Me and the girls just call him the Hombre man.
Ross, they are killing you out there!
So uh, you're not gonna be able to live here for a while, you ladies have a place to stay?
Well, you'll have to wait your turn.
I'll be back in ten minutes.
And finally, our biggest item of the night, the 22-foot gentleman's day sailer sailboat. The winning bid was a whooping $20,000!
Well, we were very young when we had her.
Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sister's beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way. Although, I should probably tell you, she's a porn star.
What? Oh!
No.
Horrible!
Yeah, we're gonna go.
I know! I-I'm a big fan of yours.
Hey!
Dysprosium.
Oh well thank you. Such a gentleman. Thank you. Ahh, it all looks so nice, so festive, all the balloons... The funniest thing happened to me on the way here. I was...
The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you would think this.
Okay, what was wrong with that call?
Oh, you didn't have to do this.
Ow!
Yeah, big fan.
I don't know anything about music, but I think you're really, really great.
Oh, I hate this but I-I-I have to go. I-I can't miss my flight.
Oh wow. I really wish you'd call me.
Show me in the table.
When's my daddy coming back?
Okay.
Hmm?
Hi! What are you doing here?
I don't have anything.
Clearly, I'm having sex with him?
Oh Drake.
But, you left the chair area.
Miss Waltham, is at the rehearsal dinner and it's not polite to make fun of people. Goodbye.
Are you being British?!
Are you sure?
Oh.
Ooh, Jack.... Sometimes I forget how powerful you can be.
Guess who?
I needed to buy a hammer the other night, and I'm out walkin' around the neighborhood but apparently there are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.
Hi!
Howard's the handy man!
Oh.
Well then here's the deal, you won't have to so long as never ever show your faces in this coffee house ever again.
Well, we've been flirting back and forth, but I was hoping that tonight it would turn into something a little more than that.
Not really.
You don't think I'm cute?
Mister Pretensous, you think there's no one finer, well but your poems are unpublished, and you work in a diner.
Well, that's not bad at all. I mean, you had me thinkin it was like a fleet.
Well, of course.
Whenever you're ready.
Can I help you?
Look, look at your man, Ewing. Nice shot. You know what, he couldn't hit water if he was standing on a boat.
Oh, shoot, we gotta go, got a reservation in 30 minutes.
Ross!
Rach, are you okay?
Oh my!
No no no.
Excuse me. Excuse me. Sweetheart! Come!
Wow!
Do you want to ride around town on my little pink bicycle?
Ahh, are you hadsome.
Well umm, maybe if it had more heat.
Come on in.
She's not much of a phone person.
Hi.
Okay.
Yeah, well, sure I touch them, but I spent years learning not to squish them. That's my hand.
Ah, that's okay, thanks.
All right, all right, there's a few too many people in this room, and there's about to be one more, so anybody who's not an ex-husband or a lesbian life partner, out you go!
I don't think so. Let's take it back to Richard's last line. Action!
Loosening the saddle on mother's horse was brilliant Fredrick. And the electric fence, inspired.
Hey! Take these cappuccinos to table 11 and that guy over there wants the biscotti.
Yes!
Wow!
The next tour of the wine cellar will plan in two in-in minutes...
Perhaps, uh, the three of us, just could. . .
No, your a masseuse, it's cool, I'm not a cop.
Hey, that kid looks familiar.
I knew it, wow!!
Alright people, now everyone grab a partner.
That's not my monkey. Just the dress is mine, you can send that back whenever.
Oh, you don't have to do that every time.
I want you Drake.
Yeah.
Stop it!
Ross of.....
COME ON!!!!
Isn't this great?!
This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.
Yeah.
Alright, let me just get my coat.
Hallelujah!
It's Eddie you freak, your roommate.
No! I mean you're a really nice guy and I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend, I'm just y'know, I just don't feel that way about you.
There's no way he smells, he's the only one around here with a shower in his dressing room.
All right.
I have a family, I'm gonna be here.
Oh well, I'm divorced.
Hey.
Umm, it costs $16,000 each time you do this. So, umm, we're kinda using all the money we have to do it just this one time.
Lovely to meet you.
Honey, relationships are hard. Like with your Mom and me. You know after we graduated college we broke up for a while. It seems her Father, your Grandfather, wanted her to travel around Europe, like he did. Of course, he got to do it on Uncle Sam's nickel, because he was also strafing German troop trains at the time. However,
Hey!
Back on in 30 seconds people!
I don't think you understand packing. Look, I just don't want to leave it to the last minute. Last time I left in such a rush, I left my knickers here.
The shipment never made it through Omaha?
Oh, hello Ross!
Call me.
Ross, whose glasses are those?
Hey there Ross!
Hi!
Uh-huh, yeah.
You know where I work!
Okay!
Yo, Chloe, do you have a quarter for the condom machine?
Oh damn, I hate that.
We know how expensive weddings can be, besides this may be the only wedding we get to throw .
I guess I'm saying, I'll try and quit. I kinda like that you worry about me.
He's kind of intense huh?
Maybe he's intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.
'Despair fills the mattress showroom. My kingdom is suddenly without a queen. I'm so depressed I'm going to slash... my prices!! Check it out! Four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set! I'm going medieval on prices!
Ross? Ross?
Morning!
Pete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, he's just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just...
Okay. You've got a small, minor infection in that left eye. I want you to take these drops three times a day and you'll be as good as new.
Oh, ow! Did Joey tell you to say that? You guys, are too much!
Oh, no thanks.
Well, I wouldn't call her a star, but she's really good. You should check out Inspecther Gadget.
Y'know uh, actually I-I-I should get going.
I could have birds.
Hey Joey! We're ready.
I don't want you taking that thing.
Monana was very brave.
No, that was clenching.
Yeah.
You really sure?
Sure.
Do you realise that we have not seen each other since the night of that U2 concert?
Oh. Whew!
Hey Chan, is that Joey guy gonna come by and pick up his moose hat or should I just toss it out?
8!:
OK, I'll just sit here and... uh... chat with your, uh.... friend-type....people.
Monica, why have you brought me here of all places?!
It's older than that. Ross was actually conceived right near this tuxedo.
Actually, he is getting closer on the talking thing. He can't quite say mama yet, but once he said yumen.
What?
That's a good one.
That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.
Oh, great! Me too.
Looks like it.
Last I heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate.
So, Monica, how's the ankle?
Hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before I take my bath.
Finally, I thought we'd never be alone. Can I just tell you something, I have not stopped thinking about you since the party.
And I'm his friend, Dr.Rosen.
Got it!
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Hey, we were sitting there.
Good one. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the training again, whenever.
I'm Megan Bailey.
Oh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.
Hello!
I'm sorry guys, closed set.
It's all right. It's all right. You don't have to explain. This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control.
You can't.
Aaahhhh. AAAAHHHHHH.
Yeah, they still wear underwear.
Welcome everybody, welcome to Amazing Discoveries!
Then, what's the problem?
Okay.
So are ready for the gym? They've got this new rock climbing wall, we can spot each other.
Alrighty. From the top.
Why? Are we done for the day?
Hey, be right there.
No. No, you're not a loser.
It's not here.
Thanks.
I'm sorry. Look, I know this can't bring him back but here, it's just a gesture.
Oh my God!!
They're gonna fire you! You can't date a student! It's against the rules.
Well that wasn't easy.
I'm 16.
Do you have a sec?
Night.
I just hope...
I say, punch him Joey.
It looks like one of her eyebrows fell down. Now unless someone convinces her to let me bleach it, Jean-Claude Van Damme is gonna be making out with Gabe Kaplan.
What?
It's kidney stones.
Y'know, I wore that cashmere sweater on a date last night.
We're still rolling!
Oh, thank you Chandler! I just bought it.
Please! I have people coming from out of town today! And, I told them all about your candy!
Hello, funny Valentine.
Hi, is uh Phoebe here?
Okay, you're at ten centimeters. Time to start having some babies. All right, I want only the father in here please.
She broke my arm.
Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, it's not your fault.
You're taking this all wrong. Because, if I didn't leave you that tip, you wouldn't of come down here, we wouldn't be having this argument, and there wouldn't be this ah, heat between us.
Oh, I still do. Next year, I hope to make varsity though.
Let it go, Ross.
I dropped a cup.
Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass.
You did!
I appreciate this soo much, I've been trying to go out with this guy for like a month.
Don't spoil it.
Okay, now I'm really late.
Okay, I-I get the picture. Uh, thanks, for your time.
Hi, can I help you?
So how are you? I've been meaning to ring you ever since I arrived but umm, well, I've been rather busy.
Yeah?
Hey! How's Ben?
Vic! Where have you been, baby?!
Oh that's great! You are the best!
Maybe I should go!
Stop!! Stop it! You must stop! You are bad actors! This is a terrible play! I'll see you in the morning.
Look, you don't want to fight me.
Well, the director thinks you're really right for the part and wants to meet you tomorrow.
Really? You'll do anything?
O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.
Are you kidding? My girlfriend doesn't know, I'm not gonna tell them!
Your son.
I'm going to look into your eyes now.
Yeah. How 'bout that.
Stay.
No! It's because that way the camera only sees her! Do you wanna try it?
Professor Geller?
Because I'm in love with you.
I-I gotta say, I-I-I-I'm not too sure I agree with that.
I have a wonderful idea. You should take Rachel to the prom.
Hey!
I'll go.
I swear, whatever I was doing, I was always thinking of you.
Look I just thought that...
You're kidding! Oh, I love him.
Oh, hi. It's Mark.
Can I please see your face?
Huh?
Hey Mon.
Oh! You know what I need?
There's nothing to wonder about, Monica. You're gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that's who you are.
Well, I don't care about the divorces either, but I wouldn't date him. It's just that he's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl.
Hey, honey! Okay, so did you find any apartments? Anything in Brooklyn Heights?
Well, I'd gotten Judy pregnant. I still don't know that happened.
