We're on in 3, 2,
It looks like one of her eyebrows fell down. Now unless someone convinces her to let me bleach it, Jean-Claude Van Damme is gonna be making out with Gabe Kaplan.
Welcome back to our fall telethon. Now if you've been enjoying the performance of Cirque Du Soleil, and you'd like to see more of the same kind of programming, it's very simple. All you have to do is call in your pledge and at that time tell the operator, one of our volunteers, what kind of programming you'd like to...
Oh, no!! No, no!
I'm probably gonna need those. Huh?
No.
Hey.
Uh-huh.
Hi, honey.
Hi, nice to meet you.
Oh I wish you're grandmother had lived to see this.
Thanks a lot.
Nope.
Not really.
I can write an epic poem about this lip.
You idiot, you stupid cowboy, you blinded me, I'm suing!
Night.
Okay uh, however...
Hey!
No!
I don't think I'd be comfortable with any of my old lovers there.
Yeah!
Ready?
No I'm not.
A moustache comb.
How you doin'?
I did.
No, I hate cats.
Macaroni and cheese! We gotta make this!
Then, what's the problem?
No, we are. I'm sad.
Drake, look out.
It's-it's-it's almost dead!
Aw come on Phoebe would you just think about it?
Bye dad.
Looks good. I'll take it.
All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I need Excuse me, could I have this?
I know, it's horrible isn't it?
Well, I don't think this, y'know.
Lebanon.
I'm not coming back.
Let me tell you a story. When I set out to create Moss 865, do you think it just happened overnight? No. There was Moss 1, that burnt down my Dad's garage, there was Moss 2 that would only schedule appointments in January, and 862 others that I learned from, just like I learned from this fight, never to let a guy stand on my neck.
Daddy!
Who?!
Oh, alright.
Of course.
Take thee Ross...
Umm...
That's not all.
I'll call the university and tell them about your relationship and have you fired.
I see him, you guys are just the worst hiders ever.
Hi!
I'm Irish.
We're outta here!
Oh, is there a problem?
Really? Then why are you like that?
Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you.
Nope! That never happened to me!
Oh, yeah. Wasn't that like a year ago?
Nooo!
Seeing some more of your super-cool slides.
Hello.
Diet Coke.
Oh, isn't a shame when one girl ruins it for the whole bunch?
I'll go in a second, I-I just wanted to tell you that there hasn't been a day where I didn't regret giving you up.
Dr. Farber, we've got a bit of an emergency here...Jason Costalano is choking on his retainer.
Let's go!!
I know this is crazy but am I too late?
Oh, because I was thinking, the semester's over; you're not my teacher anymore.
Hey!
Now Ross, repeat after me. I Ross...
Rachel is my girlfriend.
Well, it was great seeing you the other night.
It's kidney stones.
Joey!
You want me to cancel it?
Ice coffee? Tell me it's ice coffee!
That I was not expecting.
Yeah.
You may kiss the bride.
Oooh, c'mon, shut up, it's fun. Gimme a hug. Well, I think we're ready for some tequila.
Y'know, thanks for trying to cheer me up, but I'm not gonna date some random guy from your work.
Yes, it is. Carol! Hi!
Wow, that's great.
I can still see you!
It's my baby too.
Oh my God!
Well, up yours too!
The new girl's good.
Hey!
Oh! What about, what about the girls?
Umm, no, I don't think so.
The next tour of the wine cellar will plan in two in-in minutes...
Whoa.
Are you close with them?
Oh, OK. Oh, sorry.
Oh God!
Si.
OK. You better. Oh God, here we go. Hey wanna see 'em go nuts? Watch this. Who needs glasses?
Phoebe, listen...
You did a good thing today.
Next on the platforms are... ...you two! And... ...You two!
It was just so awkward and bumpy.
Come on, lady!
Well um, why don't you call me in 20 years and tell me if you're still upset about this.
Hang on.
Hi Rachel!
...I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken.
Hey by the way, I'm sure Sipowicz is gonna be all right. I heard that kid from Silver Spoons is really good. And where did you find my badge?
My uncle dragged us there. But, it actually it turned out to be really interesting.
Not Sean Penn. Alright, I, I've got a funny one, alright. My last girlfriend Tilly. Ok, we're eating breakfast, right, and I made all these pancakes, there was like 50 pancakes right. And all of the sudden she turns to me, alright, and she says, 'Eddie.' I say, 'yeah,' she says, 'Eddie, I don't want to see you anymore.' And it was literally like she had reached into my chest, ripped out my heart, and smeared it all over my life, ya know. And now there's like this incredible abyss, ya know, and I'm falling and I keep falling and I don't think I'm ever gonna stop. That uh, wasn't such a funny story, was it?
Yeah.
Taxi.
So you spied on me. I can't believe you don't trust me.
All right, who should we call first, your folks, or Deb and Rona?
But you should probably talk to my roommate, because I told him and he knows Phoebe too.
Ohh, well when you said all you were going to be doing between now and the time you leave is packing, you didn't really leave me much choice. Did you?
Hi Kim.
Yeah! Hey, do Monica and Rachel work there?
He's not a hero. ...You know who our hero is.
Yeah.
Oh, I wish. No, you know he was just trying Ross's Hug and Roll thing.
Cigarette's don't control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.
I told that guy who answered your phone.
What're you doing?
Beep!
Why would we be freaked?
C'mon hurry, hurry.
Look, I just wanted to have coffee with Rachel.
Two days before Christmas? Sorry, man.
Hey.
Don't, I like it dirty.
Girls, sit down.
I feel good! ...Who are you?
Yeah, I just gotta run to the bathroom.
Yeah, since the divorce, when anybody asks me how I am, it's always with a sympathetic head tilt. 'How ya doin'? You OK?'
But, you got up!
Yeah, so, please don't fire me for doing this.
Pizza delivery.
I can't believe there's somebody coming out of you right now. There's somebody coming out of you! Is it? Is it? It's my son.
Yeah, that would be fantastic! My-my nephew is crazy about the Knicks! This is fantastic, thank you so much Rachel.
Thanks a million.
Nice hat.
Monica!
And the spitting?
Yeah, I'm looking for Phoebe, does she still live here?
Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!
Oh my God, Rachel!
Hi!
Yeah. All right.
No-no-no, no. I'm going to talk. I believe that the sun has set on our day in the sun.
She's your partner.
It's really nice to see you again.
Animal Control.
Dr. Geller, Kurt Rathman, I'm a professor in the paleontology department here.
You're not gonna speed anymore right?
Can I do it to you?
What kind of surgery?!
That you and daddy were not on a break.
Kristen.
Just walking past the kitchen I saw 10 violations! I'm shutting this place down!
Well it's wonderful to have you up and about, again, dear.
Are you kidding? My girlfriend doesn't know, I'm not gonna tell them!
No more pranks.
Think I better go before mommy starts weeping.
That's fine. Well, your other dad and I are gonna go have a romantic evening and I guess I'll just see you kids around.
No.
Don't do this to me, again. You'd know I'd stay here in a minute, but I'd really miss so much work, they'll fire me.
What?!
Hey!
There are a couple of forms to fill out.
Ok.
Ross.
Message erased. To record a message begin speaking at the tone.
Hey!
Joey Tribbiani! I'm surprised your big head could fit through our small halls! I gotta go Joey.
We were playing rugby.
Yes! Phoebe.
You bet. Maybe some other time?
So...
Right, okay, the one that lives in Montuak, umm-hmm.
What?
What-what's going on?!
...Yes?
Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it's just cruel.
Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much. Oh, and in case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster.
Listen, I-I-I don't come to this city much so I don't know if you're crazy or this is some kind of street theater, but could I have my keys.
You know, my brother and his boyfriend have been trying to adopt for three years. What agency did you two go through?
Isn't this great?!
Totally, I love them! And, maybe you could finish telling me about all the different kinds of sand.
Ah, cool! Taco shells! You know, these are... they're like a little corn envelope.
Your name, please?
Phoebe...
I'm not sure I know what you're getting at.
I'm supposed to meet and hug a fan whose dying, but that's not supposed to be until later!
Uh, uh, uh, I am here.
What? Oh!
You are!
More of Grandma's teramisu.
Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, it's not your fault.
You're right. We'll go with the burgundy.
If I had one wish, it would be to build a time machine, go back to when I was 7, when Jimmy Hauser had the chicken pox. I would grab that kid and rub him all over my face.
Wait. You're right. I know you're right. And, thanks for being so nice. Here
Hear that? She likes me best, and apparently there've been a lot.
Joey, I'm gonna tell you the same thing I told Al Minser and his pyramid of dogs. Take any job you can get and don't make on the floor.
Hey! Sugar-O's!
Here's my binoculars.
Maybe he's intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.
Alrighty. From the top.
No. No, haven't seen a monkey. Do you know anything about fixing radiators?
Okay, Ms. Lambert handles all our closures. Would you come over here please?
Yay!
Can I help you?
Hello
I know! I know! And then you lose your apartment! And then you lose your job! And then your ex-wife gets married so fast! And now the coffee-ahh!! Ross, we need to talk.
...in love with you.
Suddenly, I very aware that I'm naked.
What?
The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didn't tell him not to call me, did you?
Oh no! Oh no!
No way!
Are you sure, I can crush a walnut with my butt.
Bye.
Oh! You're right. Oh God. But, before I can say 'good-bye', there's something I really need you to know, Chandler. The way I feel about you, it's like, I finally understand what Lionel Richie's been singing about. Y'know, I mean what we have, it's like movie love, you're my soulmate, and I can't believe we're not going to be spending the rest of our lives together.
OK, I'll just sit here and... uh... chat with your, uh.... friend-type....people.
Why?
What are these, stitches?
So, what are you guys in the market for? We've got uh, scarves, tulip post cards...
So, what time is Monica supposed to get here?
You could kick anyone's ass you want too.
I'll take a look at him.
Well, not unless it's got something to do with dehydrating my man because right now I'm a dehydrating maniac!
It's okay...
Her name's Debra.
No, no, no. We were there last night. She kept... ..bringing swordfish. are you gonna go to the, um?
Whoa! Hey-hey! What's going on here? Who is this guy?
Jingle bells, jingle bells...
Hey Phoebe.
No. You?
You know, we're all wondering who this Rachel is. Can you point her out to me?
You wanna return this couch? It's cut in half!
Ohhhhh!
Okay. And don't worry, I'm not just gonna take you out for donuts.
Scene 5, take 1.
I thought he was with you.
So it's just your mother then.
Well, I think uhh, someone out there may have been bad mouthing you all over town.
Hey!
Well, I'm sorry. I just thought I'd try to make the place a little nicer.
Hard quality.
No, she touched mine first!
Just do it.
I want you to met some friends of mine. This guy is my hero, he comes in with some stuff he wants it blown up 400%, we said we don't do that, and he says you gotta. And y'know what, we did it. And now anytime anybody wants 400, we just say 'let's Ross it!'
Tell her, David. 'I don't wanna go to Minsk and work with Lifson and Yamaguchi and Flench, on nonononononono. I wanna stay here and make out with my girlfriend!!'
You slept with another woman?
Pete?!
That's just the way it is.
Hey, what kind of puppy do you think I should get?
What?
Yeah.
Way to go son! I knew you'd find him!
What, look back?
Noth- I was- I was just saying to my-
I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later.
Is that an expensive blouse?
What'd I get?
Uhh, I can't.
Thing?
No no, it, it's fine, believe me. I do it too. I always answer with the 'I'm OK' head bob. 'I'm OK.' 'You sure?' 'Yeah, I'm fine.' Hey listen, I've got to set up the music. I got a new CD changer, of course the divorce only left me with 4 CD's to change.
Oh, sorry!
Oh that explains all the women's underwear.
Amy!
All right.
Hey!
The thing is, I think some of the parents, they were kinda hopin' that you'd play more songs about like, barnyard animals.
Five more seconds.
Hello?
Ugh. Ross!
Where have you been?
I'm afraid so.
No! That's bluffing. Lesson number one. Let me tell you something... everything you hear at a poker game is pure crap. : Nice earrings.
All right, I need a clamp, sterile towel, and channel 31.
You! Chuckles! What's your name?
You think you could make a mess and the big man in coveralls will come in here and clean it up, huh? Well, why don't think of someone else for a change?
Ohh, y'know, Susan's gonna be shooting a commercial in London next week.
Well, you've got a little scratch on your cornea, your gonna have to wear a patch for a couple of days.
Well, my nose got lonely.
Alright. What's the message?
Huh?
He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet!
Have fun.
What is in the cup?!
What are you guys doing?!
You look strong, why don't I take that and you grab one of the boxes.
All right. Here's your first baby.
I told you, we're adding new operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training?
What about Julie?
Hello.
I can't help you Joey.
And for you?
Now-now calm down. Come look in my office, some of it my still be in the trash.
Danny! Hurry up! The bath is getting cold!
I knew it, wow!!
Except stilts.
Julia..
Okay, which one of you guys is Gunther Central-Perk? Hey, Joey?
I um, was sorta thinking about maybe...
What?!
No.
Hey, sorry I'm late. But my, uh, grandfather, he- died about two hours ago. But I-I-I couldn't get a flight out 'til tomorrow, so here I am!
Well, I have to tell you, I was quite impressed with your paper on Pre-Cretaceous fossils. Yeah, it confirmed everything that I have written.
She's there?!
Would you like some more coffee, baby-doll?
Oh, I'm gonna kick Chip's ass.
Yes.
Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! You have got yourself a book.
Oh, no, no, it's about you.
So umm, I'll see you tomorrow, huh?
I won't! Until I have my next cigarette.
Son of a bitch!
Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!
Well he left four years ago so we're expecting him back any minute now.
Rachel stop!
This is impossible. Its just impossible.
Yay!!
I just came up to say, "Hi!" Hi! And you, sweetie, I'll see you tonight.
I know! I-I'm a big fan of yours.
Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
Oh!!
That might be fun.
Oh, thank god, it's not Mitzi. It's just a rat.
Uhh, you said there was a party.
What can I say? She nailed it.
You picked a great couch.
What?
I know, really well. In fact, I'm gonna ask Phoebe to move in with me.
Yeah!
Hey baby, I'm back...
Well, uh, sometimes I think about selling my practice, we could move to France, make French toast.
I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy.
Oh!... Right!
Oh, Ross? Ross! You can't put up flyers in here.
Oh-ho, yeah. Yeah, the hand guy.
Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it.
1...2...3!
So is Joey around?
You guys tell them you were married?
Lemonade? You ok man?
Okay, then.
Coffee.
No Santa? Was I bad?
Is that supportive?
Bite me, blondie!
Morning. Good morning.
You too.
I thought you wanted to adopt your cat.
How does it happen?
You're so sweet! And I'm so surprised!
I think you'll like it, it has two out of the three tenors.
So, you wanna get a hamburger or something?
No, it's you!
Hey, hey, hey there aren't any clothes in it.
No, I ahh, had another idea.
So when people complement me on my cooking should I, what do I say?
Ohh!
Weird Girl, what are you doing?
Excuse me, you think I'm cheap?
Well, if you don't, I will.
I wanted to say how much I enjoyed your class.
They-they-they can smell fear.
Ahh, I'm afraid I have some bad news. Marcel has passed on.
Do you have any tissues?
It's a bathing suit?
Oh, yeah you loved that glove! You took it every place you went. You never went any place without that glove.
I had a really nice time tonight.
Sophie, get in here!
Whats she doing here?
It's like I'm lookin' in a mirror. Anyway, they're called "fishtachios". They taste exactly like pistachios, but they're made primarily of reconstituted fish bits. Here, try one. You're not allergic to anything, are you?
All right!!
Hey!
I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented that beach house together.
Bona sera.
I just got a call to be a dancer on a television special for New Year's Eve. It's called some sort of Dick'n Rock'n Dickie Eve.
Can I get you something from the bar?
So long, Vic!
Ohh, I love Chinese! How did you know I love Chinese?!
And then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest, and, and his stomach!
Okay, my trainer, Ho Chi, is teaching me a combination of Gee Koon Doe and Brazilian street fighting, I've even had my own octagon training ring designed.
That's it? That's the giant number you were afraid to tell me?
Wait a minute, hold it. Johnson! Will you come in here a moment?
Hey, y'know I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there?
Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league.
Two pounds of Moca Java please.
Oh, I got it.
Wine?
But we broke up.
No.
Cut.
Folks, has this ever happened to you. You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk, and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.
I'll be back in ten minutes.
Ohh, so cute.
Well he got sick, and then he got sicker, and then he got a little better but then he died.
Well, if you want, you can work here.
Who is this?
Okay.
No, he already knows that he owns everything in the room! He's not finding it out for the first time! So, try it again.
What?! They wanted a scary story!
Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy.
"Monica, it's Richard. Call me."
And my second grade teacher was Ms. Thomas, and my first grade teacher was Mrs. Cobb.
Yeah?
I'm looking for Phoebe Buffay!
Ohh! Yes of course, thank you, thank you, thank you so very much.
So what are you saying? It's now or never?
Well I was thinking it would be um, kind of sexy if you wore mine tonight, at dinner.
Well, I'm from California.
That's not so good.
How's my Bing-a-ling?
Who told you that?
Hi! Rachel Green's office.
This does.
Oh, just years of experience.
Oh, isn't Lori a doll?
Hey, honey! Okay, so did you find any apartments? Anything in Brooklyn Heights?
Hi.
All right, man!!
Kate?
He carries it everywhere, it's like a security blanket, but with ski boots and a kicky beret.
Ok, this could go on for a while.
Sorry.
Changing one hundred! Good luck sir.
Tag Jones.
Hey Joey, we're ready for ya! Joey, this is Alex he's going to be playing your son.
Like a hound?
Hey, dinosaur guy, look at you, so sad. Come dance.
Don't, I like it dirty.
Oh, thanks for the tip.
Me too.
I just hope...
Whattaya say we make these, uh, coffees Irish?
No, it's hard enough to get women to go out with me.
I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person that she is.
No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Kathy.
Oh, sorry, I didn't realize.
Nope.
Oh, sorry about that stuff hanging in there. It's just my thongs are too delicate for the dryer.
...what the hell does she want with half a boat...
We're at my stop. But would you like to have coffee?
That's good man, when everybody knows that the uh, the capital of Cambodia is uh...
Okay. Have you started having contractions?

Oh shout, that would have been fun.
Okay, I should, I should probably be getting back to my thing now. See ya.
Oh! God! Wow!
Yeah.
I'm pressing, a policeman is on his way.
Hey Rachel!
Are you okay? What's wrong?
Stop saying you're not talented, you're very talented. It's just with the bird dead and all, there's very little act left. Oh, honey, give me a break, will ya? Oooh, ooh, I'll talk to you later.
Thanks.
No, no, really. I suppose it's because I spend so much time, you know, where I do.
Well what is it? Come on sweetie, your like, freaking me out here.
Uh, actually I find Marion's views far to progressionist.
Yeah. So, do you want to give a check? Or...
Oh, that's attractive.
Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late now
They all had a thing for him.
Do I know you?
Okay! We're about an hour away from getting the scene lit. So uh, if you guys don't mind, can we run it a couple of times?
Well I just thought...
She took all my stuff.
...All of a sudden we realised we were in Yammon.
Flexible hours.
What're you talkin' about, I was killin' 'em.
No, you were right, you were right. I mean, I-I-I've got to give my marriage another chance.
We're getting married!
Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'.
Oh.... my.... God.
Okay, I love you. Is that so bad?
I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. Once again, rolling... water working... and action....and cut. What was that?
You are now.
You gotta take the canoe!
You're no Brown Bird, I can see you through my peephole.
Hi.
Earl Grey?
You told on us?
Shh! No! Joe Hill!
Really?
What?
And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.
No suds, no save. Ok?
Oh, just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues. Y'know, that you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance.
Let it go, Ross.
Surprise!!!
