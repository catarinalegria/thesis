What?!
So how was Joan?
No, umm, he met some girl at the coffee house.
'Scuse me?
Well, you're not gonna get going are you?
And the fact that they're both monkeys.
There it is. Joey, what are you doing?
Oh my god.
Making holiday candy for the neighbors.
No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!
It's Chandler! Are you OK?
Wow!
Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller.
Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?
Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?
Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this.
Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?!
I'm sorry, okay? It just-tonight was supposed to be y'know, it was supposed to be a big deal.
What's hard to believe?
Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.
When?
Whose little ball of paper is this?!
Chandler?
Fine,
No honey. You have to sleep on this side of the bed because I have to sleep on this side of the bed.
Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day?
I-I'm not gonna be able to make it into work today, I don't feel very good. Yes!! Wow! Uh, for a second there I thought I was really better, but I'm not.
And some of us really have to pee.
Okay!
Forget it.
No.
I do.
So, what are you saying now?
So what, he's a little older, big deal, I mean he's important to me. Ya know if you ask him, he might take you on his Jag.
Can you just hold on for one minute?
I gave you a key for emergencies!
Wait a minute, I can get ice at the restaurant...
Including me?
I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you made me.
So Chandler, I guess I'll see you at dinner.
You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!
Between you and...
Alright, here you go, sweetie.
Great! It's so amazing! I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I was so nervous, but then after being with you I'm all like, "Can the doctor see me now?"
OK, um. Goodbye.
Hey! Happy Anniversary!
Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you're moving out?
No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.
Oh man! I did it again!
No-no-no, that's a video-phone. But hey guys you're not supposed to be here, so please, do not touch anything.
Yeah.
Why, do you write him a lot?
Wow, all you need now is The Killing Fields and some guacamole and you've got yourself a part-ay.
No. You don't have any of these cute little obsessive things.
What's 'pleh'?
How do you feel?
Oh, hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?
What?!
He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!
That's insurance fraud.
Gotta keep squishing.
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.
Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-that's it, that's it, all right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They're not the right size, they're not Victorian, and they just don't go.
They can't all be bad. Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is.
And it's a magnet!
No way!
You didn't.
Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Maybe I can try at intermission? Phoebe, come on... you know what? Let's just go!
Well, I just caught the live show.
Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?
Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne.
Alright.
Keep talking.
Chandler could you at least send some women to my party? Alright that's Ross.
Wait a minute, why don't you just call Mark. I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, you've got to make stuff happen.
Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been?
Yes!
So you watched the movies huh?
Where's that?
Deep Impact was the one with Robert Duval, Armageddon is what's going to happen to you if you wake me up.
I love you.
They're green?
Sweetie, I think the glasses look great. They make you look really sexy.
Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.
No, I'll do it. You just stick to your job.
Hey, what's that?
Well, I think I shouldn't look directly at them.
Well, it just seems that...
You what?
No. Not after what happened with Steve.
Why would they think they're invited?
Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel, but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.
A salad? Really I, I could do something a little more complicated if you like.
No sweetie, you've got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! You've got to kiss some serious robot ass!
What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund don't you?
Hey.
Chandler stole a twenty from my purse!
Well, he told me he was going out with the guys, I just didn't know that you were the guys.
You did not go!
What?
Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone that you love them and not have them say it back?
Hello Dan! I'm really looking forward to Saturday night! Really, really!
I thought you were going out with Elizabeth.
Ohhh, nice.
Well if-if that's what it is, then it's-it's crazy.
Hey guys!
Sure, what? Ok, ok. Music?
Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you! Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!
And they weren't looking at you before?!
You know the words! You are so into this!
Pete's breaking up with me.
Well... That's not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.
Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in fact, I'm the one that's making him wait!
Yeah, what is it?
Passport, check! Camera, check! Traveller's cheques, check!
Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up?
I can not see him? I mean, you can't tell me what to do!
It's a globe and, a pencil sharpener.
Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back?
What makes you think that I might not be okay?
Yeah, but at least I'm doing it!
And so, we're hiding in the bathroom.
I just can't stand you being here all the time.
Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!
Well, he's my parents' best friend, he has to be there.
What is it?
Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
It's almost our anniversary!
I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe...
I know! Now look, there's only one problem though. There's only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey's.
Oh, So you can move them!
All right then, when I'm done with this place, it's gonna be ten times better than that place!
Okay, come on, do it one more time!
Okay, we'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second floor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth.
Hi.
Did you like it?
No you don't.
Well, an-anyway, I just-that night meant a lot to me, I guess I'm just trying to say thanks.
Thank you Joey, thank you so much!
So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.
Bye-bye.
Hi Phoebe.
Yes!
Hi!
Hi, how are you doing Kelly?
Awww, look at Aunt Monica's little boy!
I know the code to his answering machine.
Ow!!
Two.
If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.
Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica! Oooh, I can't leave her!
Phoebe.
You stole them from me!
Well, no. But...
Hey!
One hour? You are such a leaf blower.
Do you have a plan?
Chandler, you're not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe it's time that you let that stuff go. If your father's not at your wedding...you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life.
Y'know what, let's do the catering business.
Okay.
How ya feelin'?
Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?
Okay, this is the den. All right, check this out. Lights! Whoa! All right. Less lights! Bad lights! Lights go away! Oh, see you just need to find the right command.
That's right.
Hey Chandler, wanna do it with me?
What about your breath?!
That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?
Joey?! Oh my God, Rachel!
Hey Ross, maybe if your skin was lighter. Your teeth wouldn't look so bright.
What are you doing?!
No! Wait! I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie! I do stuff like this at work all the time.
Hi.
Where's Benny? There he is! Where's Benny, there he is.
Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember!
Well I didn't want everyone to think I was stupid.
And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? And the chairs can face this way , and... You go.
Are we still on that?
So, wait, you really did like my cookies?
Y'know what, I like Kathy.
Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch!
Oh no it's not, no it's not. It's a first date. I'm sure that nothing is gonna...
Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las Vegas he'll know that you're sorry.
Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?
But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.
Hey.
Oh my God! It's like one mind.
Okay everybody, let's go! Let's go!
Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!
Alright, great. Thanks a lot. I'm going to tap class.
We'll just...we'll just let her stay.
It is not over! You're over!
No, to get a table! Places like are always shakin' you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.
No, we don't.
Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late.
Ohh! Did you do what I said? Did-did-did you tell her?
He's not boring! He's just-he's just low key.
Well, tonight was-was going to be my first time.
You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes...
Because! She's my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! We're family y'know? Well that's important to me.
Phoebe, they didn't make you pay for those knives, did they?
I'm afraid so.
A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.
Kinda like your Barca lounger.
So, where do you want to go?
No. I hate this part.
Why not?
Of course!
Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can't eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.
Ok, here, watch this.
Oh, I can't pass for 22?
Yeah. I bet you can't guess what color my tonsils are? I'll bet the apartment!
You're so pathetic! Why can't you just accept it, we're winning because I'm better than you.
Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.
Hi!
Why?!
The park huh? A public place.
Umm, I'd love too! Ooh, I love macaroni and cheese. I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek.
Strip Happy Days Game?
Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!
Oh my God yes! Who is she?
There you go, enjoy your coffee.
Just some stuff for the party.
Oh, here's a great one.
Is that some kind of boat talk?
Hi!
Oh! Did anybody see that-that documentary on the Korean War?
But, I put some honey in it.
Okay.
I gotta go water Pete's plants. Y'know what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants.
Okay! Okay, let's race! First one there wins! Ha-ha!
Let me try.
Oh-my-god Rachel! Rachel!
Yeah, ah, but Pheebs don't you think he's a little young to get married?
I made them!
YES!!!!!!!!
Okay. Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
And ice!
I swear you said you had the keys.
I have no moves. Okay, whatcha doin' there?! Oh y'know what? I'm sorry, this is just too weird.
Joey, you're this guy's teacher. I mean how could you do this?
You did a minute ago!
What the hell is this?
Really?! You promise?
What kind of changes?
No you're not.
You'd better run!
Oh, I'll have an espresso. Oh acutally, I'll get it. If I ask you to, you'll probably end up drinking it yourself.
Dad!
I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.
Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. ... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.
He is the man in the black dress.
Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just......throw your purses at it.
Hey.
Why don't you just call her?
Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?
Y'know...go! Go! Right there!
No he's not!
Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them.
Hi!
Please! I am not as bad as Ross.
All right.
Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion.
OK, wait, wait, wait, wait. You know what? Ross, let's - let's switch places. You get in the middle. No un-, ya know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something up.
Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife.
Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.
Have you found your dress yet?
Wasn't there a little song?
You were the next caller five hours ago. You must be going crazy.
So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.
You know what, I think it's cute, you trying to be more like Richard.
What uh-What did you-What?!
You say 'Thank you very much,' and then you buy me something pretty. Come on, we're gonna put are hands in this bowl, and we're gonna start squishing the tomatoes.
Danny? You know Rachel? She's nice. She's not bad to look at, right?
Ross!!
I hadn't! Photo 152 was a prototype.
Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? Come on, one of us had to mention him.
I think you're done.
Ross hasn't worked at the museum for a year!
Hey guys! Do you wanna look at the song list for the wedding? Guys?
I know what you need, you need a bodyguard. Hey Ross, what is Ben doing after preschool?
No, a guy would be saying, "I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else." Oh my God! I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else! I've been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that I'd be giving up! I mean, I...I'm never gonna have a first kiss again.
Thank you.
No-wait-no-no!!!!!!!
Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?
Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.
Rach! It's me! Pick up!
Chandler? Do you promise to be good?
Chandler?
Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time.
Oh no, she's out having drinks with Carl.
OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since she was five. You gotta listen to every word she says. Hi!
That could be a four or a five. It's your call.
Can you blame him?
What?
Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce.
Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to.
'Cause I was going by it the other day and I saw that there was a stock with my initials, MEG, on it and, well, sometimes I have to watch for two or three hours before it comes up again but when it does, it's pretty exciting.
For this weekend! Oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see Joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane. We can call it out plane-aversary.
Really?
I had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!
I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything.
Yeah hey, a weird thing happened today whey I was at brunch. This woman overheard that I was marrying you and-and then she...she wished me good luck.
Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So...
It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.
I think she's here.
Two!
What?
You guys, I am not that bad!
So what'd he say?
Ross, that is gorgeous!
That is so unfair!
Oh my God! Fog him! Fog him!
Hey!
Phoebe that's crazy!
Yeah, I think that fifth shower actually got the interview off me.
Aunt Syl, stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna. Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape.
Ross this is the only thing left that has a shot at working.
Yeah, come on, we can be guys!
Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?
You can, I know you can!
Just uh, do the right thing.
Paris?
Hi, Ben. Hi. I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes I am. I'm your Aunt Monica. I...I will always have gum.
Hey!
Oh my God! He's gonna rat me out!
Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy.
Hey, we would still be living here if hadn't gotten the question wrong!
What do you mean?
Yeah... ..see, I was supposed to get married, but, um, I left the guy at the altar.
Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke.
Chandler, wh-why don't we sit down?
Then what is it?
I'm so happy for you!
Ohh, I'm such an idiot. I can't believe I actually thought she could change.
Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'I'm secretly married to a goat?'
Nighty-nite.
All right relax Mr. I've Had Sex Four Times!
That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I feel the same way.
Umm, do you have any uhh, moves?
Thank you. They're yours.
Chandler, relax it's not a contest. Certainly not a close one.
When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out.
Uh-huh, what exactly did you ask her?
Dammit, dammit, dammit!
Have I read it? No, are you enjoying it?
Alright.
They've arrested Monica.
That's sounds great, but how are you going to afford it?
Okay, those people just left, come on! Quick! Give him the money and get their table!
I promise you, he would definitely want you back.
Not a basset, a bassinet.
Hey! How's it goin'?
I know.
Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!
Yeah, like you're gonna be pregnant. I mean pregnant.
Toe the line. Thread the needle. Think outside the box!
The woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when you were 13?
Just, I love you so much. Just...It's just sometimes it bothers me that I'm never gonna have that feeling. Y'know when you meet someone for the first time and it's new and exciting? Y'know that rush?
Okay, I've broken them down into categories. Okay, we have uh, we got holidays, birthdays, candids, y'know... And then what I've done is I've cross-referenced them by subject. Right? So if you're looking up, oh let's say birthdays and dogs, you get Photo 152. See?
Oh.
Art it is.
Yeah, Ginger something.
You're on the phone!
Hang on a second I just got in.
Very good.
Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!
Sure.
And what if I was still fat? Well, you wouldn't be dating me, that's for sure.
Why would you do that?
You don't have to stick up for her. She can't here you.
Hah!
Mail call, Rachel Green, bunk seven.
Oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do?
What?
Hey, are we still on for tonight?
Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room.
Ross, your little creatures got the remote again.
Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can't get out of!
Oh, this is so hard.
Well, who's voice was that?
I have not been sick in over three years!
You keep saying that.
Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you!
Oh, great!
How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example.
It's 9:30 in the morning!
Hi.
No drops!
Couldn't you just stay like this forever? Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?
He just told me at the counter. He made me promise not to tell, but I couldn't hold it in any longer!
Oh yeah, well there's the possibility that I won't make rent.
Uh-oh, what's the matter?
What's the part?
Oh, you two must have been so cute running around on a barge.
You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what I mean. You know what I mean?
Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!
Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.
What?
Oh, really?!
Hey.
Well, maybe you're right-She made fun of my phone pen!
It was.
I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.
Gee, I don't know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!
Oh my God! Well push it in! Push it in!
What are we gonna do?
Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it.
Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?
I won't give you anything, but you'll owe me 2.95.
Hey, guys.
He cannot play at our wedding! I mean everyone will leave! I mean come on, that is just noise! It's not even a song!
Well, I just think the baby would keep falling off the dog. Do you, uh, do you , do you not see kids in our future.
Isn't it.
What?!
Look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, I don't know... but, uh, I'm kind of worried about you.
Gunther, can I get a coffee to go?
This bottle opener.
Did you like her? And I'm just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this.
Michelle! Of course, it was Michelle! Did it sound like Michelle?
All right baby, come on! Yes! Yes! I am on fire!
Yeah well, I ran into Richard.
Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me. li-listen, Dad, I can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um... there's something that I've been meaning to tell you...
No.
Well, you know.
Joey, you had the night!
Hi guys!
Dr. Burke? I don't think so. I mean, like, he's a grown up.
Think about it.
Bye!
Poor thing!
Barry who you almost...?
Oh, god... She's told you that already, didn't she?!
Hi! Hey, Pete you're back! Hey, check this out.
Hey, have you seen Rachel?
So look umm, while we're st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right?
I'll call you back.
I mean they're trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I've been waiting for my whole life.
Good. What made you change your mind?
You know, a party, or--
Well, it was the first time. Y'know, there's not always a lot of agreement the first time.
I've been great, just great. How have you been?
So, Mr. Rastatter, what exactly does this job entail? The ad wasn't too clear.
Wait! Oh my God! I can't get out!
I don't know.
All right, you ready?
Shut up!! It just got interesting!
What?
Pheebes, you know what I'm thinking?
What?! I didn't take care of everything, there's-there's plenty of things for you to do!
Yeah, I think you should keep looking!
Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand don't you?
You didn't even take off your pants.
Hey. Where is he, where's Richard? Did you ditch him?
I thought she just had one.
Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!
Ow!
Ok, let me go check. Your mom want's to say goodbye.
Okay, let's start with the free messages outside the UN.
We're supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes.
Let go! I'm a tiny little woman!!
That is true.
Thanks again.
So, what's this.
Do you not see it?
Yeah, but y'know we could sneak in and watch.
Then, I'd steer clear of Phoebe.
Monica.
I'm really not deciding!
Alright.
I can't believe you're dressing up for him. I mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again.
Have you ever taken out the trash?
Now?
Hi, again.
I get the dollhouse!
They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.
Wait. Rachel, no, he's married. Married! If you don't realize that, I can't help you.
Alright, but I'm very excited about this OK, so you gotta promise you won't get all big-brothery and judgmental.
Y'know what? I am really tired of your bellyaching! Okay, I-I worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live!
Shut up, I'm happy.
You made it!
See if he has ice.
"See you around?"
He hates to lose.
Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?
Mrs. Bing? Here, these are my parents umm, Judy and Jack Geller.
Okay, well, why don't we all meet upstairs in an hour?
Where were you? We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?
Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night. It was right here, where is it?
It's almost 8 o'clock, it's almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he?
No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about.
You used to have carpet.
No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!
And?
Soon! I-I just couldn't before. You saw how upset Joey got! I couldn't do that to her, she's my best friend!
Ooh, nice.
Feeling a little better sweetie?
Oh.
Oh God.
This is Rachel.
I can't believe he did this.
Right.
Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person. You're all going to hell.
Here, let me make the milk, I'm up anyway.
Oh. Well then way to go you big movie star!
Hey, Rache. You know what we haven't played in a while?
Okay. So what do you.... you think she's faking?
Bye!
I have some pretty exciting news!
Are you sure you're okay?
Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.
Nothin', nothin', hey you're a cheapasaurus. I'm kidding, I'm kidding, thank you, I'm very greatful.
What's a 'niffle'?
What?!
Hi. Uh, you... you don't know me, I'm Monica Geller... Ross's sister.
Did he just say 'Monica bang'?
They were lovers.
I understand.
Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail.
Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really. Yeah, Ross is great. He's uh, he's in a whole other place. No, he's gone. No no, you don't have to fly back, really. What do you mean this might be your only chance? Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet.
Yeah, and y'know, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great! , I was thinking we would eat around four.
Oh, my mother's right. I'm never going to get married.
Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight's specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag-Why is nobody writing these down?
What is it hon?
That's right. My Mom doesn't have any faith in me! Oh, that's hilarious! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
Good night!
Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!
Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, they're still extinct.'
Ya know, my party is fun. I mean, maybe it's a little quieter, less obvious sorta fun but, you know, if people would just give it a chance...
Oh please, he didn't hear it! He didn't hear it!!
Okay, here's your milk. What do you want to talk about?
Hi. Do you know what time it is?
Oh, yes, umm, I'm here to pick up a dress that you have on hold.
Oh yeah? When?
No it's not! You want it, you're gonna have to win it!
Chandler! He's your father; he should be at the wedding.
No! Listen, I'm not gonna go through this with you again, okay. Just once I wanna beat when you can't blame it on the broken nose, the buzzer, or the fact that you thought you were getting mono. Let's just call this, tie score and it's halftime.
The woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation and that we could move up our wedding and Chandler heard! I know! How bad is this?!
Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine.
Oh, good luck.
You know, it still smells like monkey in there.
You're gonna do some feet flirtin'!
Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? Yes, hold on. Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account.
Wait! Joey! Joey! Are you okay?!
Please!
Haven't you and I covered that topic?
Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, I'm engaged.
What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbi, big deal. You used to dress up like a woman.
All right, y'know what? We really are late! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!!
I think you're better than you think you are.
So wait, Ross's stuff is fine, but I have no memories because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!!
I need more swordfish. Can you get me some more swordfish?
Yeah, it's good.
No, no, I don't.
Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.
Come on! Chandler!
Are you serious?
Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win.
Rachel you have to read this book. It's called Be Your Own Windkeeper. It's about how women need to become more empowered.
Well, do you think he was waiting 'til after you left, so he could cry?
What's that supposed to mean?
Oh, I think so.
Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.
Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.
I'm also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.
Oh, from who?
No.
Rach! We weren't gonna miss our friends getting married!
Well, it's getting late.
Okay great!
That's a good call. Right.
No, no, wait. His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes.
Oh no, she's still at work, but she told me to tell you to call her.
What?
What's the charity?
No! To take more pictures of all of us together. I mean I really think it's the best resolution because everyone will enjoy the pictures.
Well, with all these doctors and nurses, I'm gonna say, midget rodeo.
Because then I don't have to!
Wow, you seem to be doing so much better. That's great. So how-how are things going?
Sure.
Put all my money in me.
Well, actually, I'm already seeing someone.
Not one that can pee on the roof.
Oh, it was awful. I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food.
OK.
Did not.
Oh, no thanks.
Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding.
Oh God!
Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.
I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.
Naked?
Okay.
Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?
Where do you want to start?
Yeah.
Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?
Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains. Okay, so um, I bunnied first so that means I get to pick first. Joey.
Oh my God! Oh my God! You have to go!
What for?
Hey, we could have used that kind of thinkin' earlier.
Oh gosh.
I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it.
Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.
No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theater!
Go on, teach me something about men and women.
Look, Phoebe!
Okay well I think...that's your answer.
Oh. Thank you. Ohhh, thank you very much. Oh, thank you for coming. Uh, just a second!
Are you kidding me?! Is this; is this turning you on?
Um-hmm.
I know!!
Mira, Ross, Marcel se llevo el control remoto.
Uhh, y'know actually I was gonna do some laundry.
See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you?
Why is this car in my bedroom?
Wouldn't you love to do it just once?!
All right, what's goin' on?
Only here.
So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.
Really?
All right. Honey, that's-that's a sleeve. Okay?
Calling Dr. Big, Dr. Big to the bed.
Well, spring vacation is doing nice things with your grandparents. Spring break you're doing frat guys.
Maybe.
No time for that!
All right, look, I hate this as much as you, but if it makes you feel better, it's all your fault.
Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football game called the 'Geller Bowl.'
By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.
Wow, for a guy who's recently lost his job, you're in an awfully good mood.
Well, what kind of food is he looking for?
Joey, what are you doing?
This isn't even my dress.
Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Why? It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?
Really?
I'm quitting!! Woo-hoo! I'm okay!! I'm all right!!
How did you get in here?
You know what. Tomorrow I'm gonna do your clocks.
I think I need a drink.
That's great.
They wouldn't have put it there if it didn't do something! How can you not care?
That'll teach you to lick my muffin.
Oh yeah right!
Um, okay, here it goes. I'm not 22. I'm, I'm 25... and thirteen months.
Do you want some shortbread? Eh that's Scottish like you are.
That noise you just made?
How can you tell? You can only see the back of his head!
Tell him.
All right, you!
Damn! It's empty!
If you want.
There's an ad for a naked chef?
It's an expression.
Well, why don't we just bunny up.
Look at these authentic fake medals. I tell ya, mom's gonna be voted best dressed at the make-believe military academy.
Okay, here comes another camera.
All right, what about the third guy?
Oh, you can have an accent and I can't?! Top 'O the morning to ya laddies!
Mm-hmm.
Chandler there's nothing wrong with crying! I mean you don't have to be so macho all the time.
Ugh, y'know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.
Yes! You are so smart! I love you.
Do you really see this as a long-term thing?
What are you crazy?!
Behind my brother's back? ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.
Okay, fine.
Just come.
We have a ladle.
Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked.
So you can't lose, it's there in the title. Wonderfullness is baked right in.
Yeah, right.
Hi, honey.
A monkey. Have you seen a monkey?
Hey! Where 'ya headin' in those pants? 1982?
Mr. Bigot. He tells the most racist jokes.
No.
Awwwww...
Okay! All right! Let's do it!
What's the big deal?
Phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia.
Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Pheebs, you've been up for 24 hours! Go to sleep, honey. Th-this isn't healthy.
This isn't mine. Hey, this isn't, this isn't my stuff! Ugh, Ross! These are your boxes! Where are my boxes?
Yes?
Okay, great! Bye. So guess who's coming to Thanksgiving dinner?
Chip, is Chip Matthews.
Oh well, it's not so bad.
Then all your stuff would be here.
Oh, wait, and I got a beeper!
Sure, I love this part!
Why?
Okay! Oh my God, thank you!!
Promise me you'll be careful.
We're kidding!
All right, so what do you say?
Is there? Is there someone else?
Well, you're making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.
I'm fine-d. I'm fine-d! Y'know, it's a really hard word to say.
Oh my God! It's true!! Oh my God you are so amazing! Oh my God, can I just ask you to do me oh, just one favor?
Joey!
Please!
Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?
Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know...
No, I want everything you just said. I want a marriage.
So I did tell you. Okay, y'know, that really isn't the thing. Umm, the thing is that, right now I'm just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me. Y'know what I mean?
That's your call.
All right then, your bra would still be big.
Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn't even asked?!
Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?
Ohhhh!! Gross!!
I love you. Hey listen umm, when, when you were talkin' about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right.
Hey!
Y'know when I said to you earlier that I was at work umm, I'm at my new work.
An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasn't significant to you!
Ohh! Ohhhh! Were you sleeping sweetie? I'm sorry. Here.
All right Rachel, you sweep behind, I'll pitch it to you, you throw it down field to Phoebe. All right. Break.
You'll see.
Did you break up with her?
Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day.
That other play?
Why, exactly?
Wow, this is so weird. I just realized this might be the last time we'll all be hanging out together.
Okay well that's good to know.
Oh, I-I don't know.
I think he's shy.
I got it!!
Let's just do it right now. Okay? It won't be hard. Just say what's in your heart.
This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, y'know she had such a terrible childhood.
What? We took a walk, nothing happened. I can back with nothing all over me.
Same category?
Wow! You might just get the first Nobel prize in rubbing. So what country is this guy from?
Well it wasn't that many guys. I mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are, it's a very small percentage.
Thank you.
Yeah I can! And don't think I don't, because I do! I mean all the time, you betcha!
Rach? Can I talk to for just a minute? I-I dropped some socks.
I got it!
Okay. We have got to beat them! {Here we go yet again.}
Oh May 15th.
We'd love too.
And I have costumes.
Aww, honey I'm sorry.
Well, uh, I ate some.
I know.. it's gonna be really hard.
I know I do.
Hey, Joey's ass! What are you doing?
Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!
We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?
Hi.
Will you stop!
It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money!
Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch! And I'm sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?
Alright, for the bizillionth time, yes I see other women in shower at the gym, and no I don't look.
Oh.... my... God.
Please, I'm not going for anything.
Just...please tell him.
See, now this is why I keep notepads everywhere.
Yeah. I'm okay. I'm actually-I'm a little cold, can I have your jacket?
Here's your key
Nah, he doesn't do anything for me.
Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don't worry about it!
Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time to get a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to London, there could be a line at customs! Come on!!
Ohh, fun!
It's so good, isn't it?
Because Phoebe and Gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!
What?!
So, are you ready to go?
Boy, you are really not a morning person.
Does anybody want these?
You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.
I'm fine.
What? I'm just said.
You look fabulous honey, you really do.
That really means a lot. Oh, and Mom, don't bite your nails.
I was frustrated with you!
Why? Because of the government.
Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I don't like my new eye doctor.
I am so jealous.
My boyfriend really does have good taste!
Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.
Do you really want to pull at that thread?
I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.
Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos.
Isn't that great?
What are you doing?
Because he'll know what to do? Oh my God, you're a genius!
Yeah.
Yo- hooo!
Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean, you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you.
Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time.
You obviously haven't screwed over a lot of your friends. Which we all appreciate.
What, what are you doing? You can't go out there.
Okay, I think I get how to do this.
I don't know, clean places?
Oh, sweetie. Oh, look at you. You're shivering.
Phoebe, you do seem a little tense. Here, let me help you.
Hey!
Yeah!
Oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!
That's right. That's right. And that is why you can't stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn't come to the wedding.
Yes.
Oh-oh, no no don't worry, I'm gonna wash it.
Burning's good.
Chandler.
Oh umm, that's because I just wanted to y'know walk in on me and Chandler while we were, y'know, doing it all night. Will you excuse me for just a second?
Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?
First of all um, I love you both so much and you're both so important to me...
Would you ever be a surrogate for anyone?
Twelve dollars an hour.
It's okay, 'cause y'know what? You don't really need me for the business.
Phoebe, do you think that your favorite animal says much about you?
You're meeting Richard?
Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.
Hi, Geoffrey.
I'm not sick!! I don't get sick! Getting sick is for weaklings and for pansies!
All right, umm, we're not gonna really keep it this way though.
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...
Tomorrow night.
..well, why don't you tell them? After all it, is your ankle.
Fun? Fun, you think this is fun?
Well, no. You're Chandler. Y'know, Chandler!
Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's.
Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is.
Oh my God! What happened?
Oh my God. Richard? Hi!
For the sixteenth time, no... I do not think you're obsessive.
Phoebe, y'know why don't we just go upstairs and have some birthday cake?
Hey! Didn't you have that outfit on last night?
And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And you're writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, "I will always be with you," and you still can't shed one tiny tear, I know you'll be crying a river inside.
Okay, I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted to do?
Did you like learn about her family?
There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!
He is so amazing.
Ow!
Hey!
Because you're on my team! And my team always wins!
'Cause I don't want to encourage this kind of behaviour.
And I'm a wuss. And we should be partners.
Five more and I'll flash you.
Hi, come on in.
I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe and she's the only one left!
Okay? Over here we have pink suede, which is nice. But umm, if it gets wet then you know it's gonna shrink.
Chandler? Can you give me a hand?
Dad! There's Ross , why don't you go talk to him?
What are you doing?
Okay, we've been out here for two hours and we haven't seen any stupid comets. Can we go now? I mean, Chandler's getting chilly.
No, you are not. We tell you stuff.
You sold me out.
Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...
Yes you are! That's the only way to explain all this stuff!
It wasn't funny at all! Why would you do that? Why didn't you pick me?
Rach, are you really gonna let him do this?
So, I'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth, and since it's Rachel's birthday, I mean, we want it to be special, I thought I'd poach a salmon.
I feel terrible, I really do.
All right.
It's not like, I haven't any opportunities. I mean, y'know, I'm just waiting for the perfect guy. I'm seeing this guy Roger, all right? He's not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with. Y'know, give him my flower.
Oh, then go Vassar.
Call them mom and dad you loser!
What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!
No, you messed it up. You're stupid.
Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing.
Everybody knows!
Yeah.
G'bye, Nana.
The oven is on.
Yeah, well you call her and tell her that y'know when we were kids her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadn't have stopped her, there probably wouldn't even be a wedding to go too.
Okay.
Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff.
Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!
Very!
So, did you do it?
What?! I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that I can give my flower to someone like him!
Would it really have been that easy?
Oh, that's okay, I can't wait to see everything again! All of the memories...
Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!
Of course.
Here's your key. All right, you have to christen it! Now, go out and come back in!
All right, Phoebe get open. Rachel, go long.
No! Chandler and I are moving in together!
It's some of Richard's hair! What do I do with this?
Are you mocking me?
Aren't you gonna...
Are you still awake?
Honey, I'm sorry.
I'm-I'm Monica.
Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?
She's leaving for three months.
Yeah! She's right in there!
No, it's not bad. It's not bad at all. It's-it's really nice.
Hey umm, what's this?
All right, well why don't I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favor?!
You really think this is okay?
I don't know! Why don't you just explain? What do they want? Find out what they want!
Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date.
Yeah, well he's my brother! And plus he drives so slow he could never hurt it.
Say it.
Hold it! Are you talking about Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve?
Yeah, well they suck too.
How who wears it?
As a joke, this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000 tip. His number is on the check, he just did so I'd call him.
'Cause you invited your assistant.
Are you scared?
Hello, people who do not live here.
I don't know why I'm here.
Chandler, what were you thinking?
Y'know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex.
We haven't eaten yet!
Then why did you move?!
Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?
Whoa! Whoa!! Tackled by a girl! Bet ya don't see that everyday, do ya?
You touch people's eyeballs every day and this feels weird.
Hey, I made $17 before breakfast, what have you done?
But I need it. Otherwords I'm gonna have to take that horrible diner job. You know, with the dancing and the costumes. I don't wanna have to wear flame retardant boobs.
Look, you and I went to different high schools...
I just-I can't believe that you think that you and Chandler know me and Rachel better than we know you.
What? I don't see anything.
Oh, what'd ya bring me?! Awww, hotel toiletries from Japan. Oh, these are gonna go in my permanent collection. You want some coffee?
How did work go?
Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?
Yeah.
That sounds like Nana.
All right.
-leg?
Third door on the left.
I'm a good person. And I'm a good chef, and I don't deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! Y'know what, if you want me to quit this bad, then all you have to do is...
What?
Yeah.
And Rachel. And that's Chandler.
Yeah.
Hi. Uh, we'll be right there, we're just trying to decide something.
Hey! My first review is out!
Yeah, we really do!
Dad, Chandler was just laughing at your joke.
Y'know I used to go out with this guy that was a really light sleeper, and whenever I started to snore, he would just roll me over...
Wow! You're a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece of paper. So how was you're trip?
There was nudity!
Oh my god.
I'm not talking to her!
Really?
Ross's apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more often?
I don't know! I don't-maybe you're feeling a little resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought you'd get married first! Maybe you can't stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!
Hello.
Hey!
The Way You Look Tonight is on here! Dance with me?
You wanna what?!
I could do that.
She's just upset because she, uh, she buttered a spider into her toast this morning.
It's not mayonnaise!!
So what happened?
What?
Chandler!
It's that terrible?
Oh I can't. Dr. Roger is coming over again.
Oh, dad, turn it off.
You're plans were with us.
Myself. Y'know for remembering to pack a thing. Yeah, you do a good thing, you get a check! My mom does it, I never realised it was weird.
Stop it Chandler. I'm sorry too.
I'm not laughing.
Oh, um, around 8:02. We ah, talked for a little while, and then um, we went out for an innocent burger.
Rachel!
Why would we do that?
Oh, you got the whole night, huh?
Oh my Gosh!
Well y'know Joey, you're a pretty charming guy.
Why not?!
I'm getting married next!!
Are you a virgin?
Yeah, I've just been fiddling around in here making delicious treats for everyone.
We do not have one of those signs.
Aw, I'm sorry sweetie that she doesn't feel the same way.
Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!
Frannie was the one who found your Playboys and showed them to mom.
I can't believe mom and dad are selling the house!
You gave my father a lap dance!
Y'know what, I'm gonna hold her head.
Okay. Sorry.
I'll do it!
Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.
Honey, I just don't think that you understood the joke.
These aren't for you! Are you upset?
Really?
Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else. And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my People magazine comes on Saturday, and the new Hold Everything catalog. Y'know but that does not mean that I'm empty, I care about things. I care about my friends and family. You have no right to make that kind of judgment about me.
The Bible?!
I knew you were likely to take a wife!
Me too.
Rachel, the cute doctors are here.
Hey.
So, you think you'll do it on his couch?
Hey, I went up.
Oh, good.
Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass.
Cause I already invited her.
Shrill?! The wedding is back on!
Hey!
Hey guys check it out! My mom sent me the paper!
Hey!
We said six!
Thanks.
Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you're really sarcastic, or that, y'know, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.
That guy stood on your neck until you passed out!
Or if you want to kiss him, umm, you could use mistletoe.
What baby?
Oop, your cake is ready!
It might be kinda cool.
Oh, none for me. Thanks.
Kinda. Oh my God!
This totally makes sense!
So, how about you huh? How do you know the happy couple?
Don't you have to pee?
All right, I'll try not to.
That counts!
All right, I'll see you guys later.
Yeah. I hope she can kick his ass.
It's Monica, open up!
Bite me.
Yeah, but that's pigs not people!
Okay, you ready to open yours?
Thanks. I think you got it!
Really?
You thought about that?
Mmmm! It's good!
Okay.
Okay, guys, listen, don't forget that tomorrow is the day that Emily gets married again, so whatever we do, just try to really keep Ross's mind off of it.
Really?
I'm sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross.
What?
Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big...
You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts, and then to top it off, I lost one of my fake boobs, in a grill fire.
It's nice.
I can't believe he has a new roommate. Who is this guy?
Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out!
Yeah you're right, we can't-we shouldn't watch this.
Is it okay for me to come in now?
Hey.
My mother's driving me crazy, but Ross is getting married. I'm happy. I'm not going to let anything spoil that.
What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?
Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant. And then you realised if you bitched about it, then you would stop cooking, and you would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.
No, that is what the game is.
Really? I'm perfectly comfortable. Hey, hey, hey, get in line buddy, I was next.
Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does.
Oh, why does this bother me so much? I mean I don't wanna be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them.
No, she's out shopping.
Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.
Hey Rach, aren't these candlesticks mine?
They're nice guys.
Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life. The whole, 'hat' thing.
Now there you go! I wouldn't want my best guest to strain her eyes!
Over here dad.
You're right. I mean I'm sorry. Yeah, I shouldn't be laughing. I should be laying down papers for you!
David who?
I lost our mattresses.
I don't know sweetie.
I don't think so.
What?!
Why not?
Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
Yeah? What does she think of your little science project?
She's bluffing!
Happy birthday dad.
Phoebe!
What kinda stuff?
You do know that was me who just said that right? Hey. As long as we're both up...
Fine!
Y'know what? You are right?!
You had sex in his chair?!... I said that a little too loudly, didn't I?
Okay, fine I admit it! I feel terrible! Would you please rub this on my chest?
What?! You're going out with her again!
you don't have insurance?
My brother, Ross.
What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial.
I know. How could we have let this happen?
Hey! How'd your date go with Jake?
I don't know.
I so wanna be attracted to you.
You are so cute.
We are talking about Rachel here. You and Rachel.
Haven't we made this decision?
So! So we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong!
Actually, I did!
Okay, I freaked out a little.
Do you wanna live outside?! Because it's gettin' cold! She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she'll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I'd like.
Oh my God!
Oh, sorry.
Never call me from that phone.
Yeah! And the winner gets a hundred bucks.
Really?!
Chandler, do you think we talk about our relationship enough?
Look!
Ohh... Oh, that's okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef. Like I have nothing better to do! So what's up?
I can't believe we've never done this before! It's sooo good! So good for Monica!
Oh he's nice. He's nice! Y'know, you always stick up for the people we fog!
That was a half an hour?
Keep going.
I'll meet somone else. There'll be other Alans.
No.
Okay, I'm not getting this!
Can I ask you just a little question, huh? Why tonight?
I'm getting married today!!! I think I just cracked a rib. But I don't care because today's my wedding day! My day is finally here!!
No. You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out.
Thanks.
Oh, Rachel, sweetie, look, here's a really cute picture of Joey and you at the reception.
He asked you out?!
Happy New Year.
What?!
No, I can't afford this either. No. I-I-I'm, I'm just to figure out which one I want then I'm gonna get it at Kleinman's, this discount place in Brooklyn, day after tomorrow they are having a huge sale.
Oh, why? Why? What happened?
You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it's offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldn't be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! Now let it go! The joke sucks!
That's stealing!
Why would I have the keys?
...horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.
Okay, just get a lot better. Fast.
Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh?
Hold on a second, just put a little club soda on it and it should umm, be.....
Again. Y'know what? I think we all did.
Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things.
You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!
I just told my Mom I'd cater a party for her.
Because the winner gets this!
We are the hottest! Huh? No one is hotter than we are! You're the best.
What's the matter?
Give me that!
Ohh, I'm so glad. Thank you so much for staying so calm during this. I mean it's really, it's made me stay calm. I coulda been worse!
Whaaat!
Yeah.
How-how are you, Mom?
I love you too Chandler.
I'll pick it up for you!
It's on us, all right, so don't worry. It's our treat.
I did.
Rachel, there's nothing in it.
Well, at least you scared someone.
Ah, yeah!
Nooo! Okay. Whoa! Okay. See I was, I was a little nervous about turning thirty. So the bus boys took me out for some drinks. I wanna puke on you later!
Oh, I love it! Thank you so much!
That'll work!
Well, thanks, we like him.
In...in two weeks.
Does he not make enough money?
You're not dressed yet?! We're supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes!
You're gonna find a place. But even if - God forbid - you didn't.. So you postpone the wedding. Is that really so bad? I mean, think about it. You could take all the time you needed to get everything that you want. You could have tulips, you could have salmon.... Mmmmm... Salmon!!
Hello? Oh yes, one minute please. It's for you. It's the fire inspector.
Hi, um, I'm gonna need a new set of these forms .
My turn? What-what are you talking about?
I gotta go to work. Has anybody seen my left boob?
Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook.
Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. It's My Giant!
Are you kidding?! I get a Porsche and the barca lounger's gone?! This is the best day ever!
Okay! Wait-wait-wait! Shhh! Okay, umm, I just wanna say that...I love you guys so-so much and-and thank you for being here on my special night. Our special night. I mean it just wouldn't be my-our-our night, if you all weren't here to celebrate with me-us-Damnit!
Oh that's an eye removal machine.
Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!
No you didn't.
Are you okay, sweetie?
Okay.
My Sweet Sixteen! Remember, you went to third base with my cousin Charlie.
I can do it, okay? Come on, let's go.
Who's Denise?
Hey!
You'll do what?
I loved them!
Oh, this terrible! Everything is destroyed! Look at this. It obviously meant enough for me to save it, and I don't even know what it is! Ohh, it's still soft. What do you think this is?
Wait, you can't have the baby here! I mean I haven't sterilised it since the guys moved out!
What are you doing with the lamp?
God, you are so strong.
Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap. Umm, this one is made of bologna.
I was in too much pain.
No, you?
Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana.
Oh look, the pool table's free. Rack 'em up. I'll be back in just a minute. Get ready for me to whip your butt.
All you had to do was buy the card!
Come on Chandler, come on! It'll give us great practice for when--people with babies come to visit.
You've been lying to me? I can't believe you'd do that.
Go!!
That's fine.
Well you did a little bit.
He's so cute.
Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.
I wa-
Hey, you guys.
Yes it's true.
No.
I'll get it! Happy Thanksgiving!
Where's your bed?
Oh, oh, okay umm, so I'll see you soon.
I'm sorry, I can't help you. See? Rules are rules.
And then we're gonna have a little Middle Eastern cous-cous. Something we can eat, with our hands.
Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I thought that I would give you just a little preview.
Oh good, another dinosaur story. When are those gonna become extinct?
I know it is the best.
No-no, I-I just, I liked them so much that I went out and bought some for myself.
...I think he deserves a Nobel Prize.
I am. I'm that stupid.
Why can't you use the phone in here?
Would you just open it?
Every year.
Men are such idiots.
I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn't that give me the right to control him-help him?
What's to know? Buy sell, high low, bears bulls... Yes Manhattan...yeah telephone number of the stock...selling store.
Hey!
Heads up Ross! Score! You suck!
Mine? Right here?
I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.
Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
Not that, this, US. Oh my God, Ross, you-re, you're, it's jus-, you-, ever sin- you been here.
This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mits to their hands.
Why? Do you think he's still mad at us?
What about the second minister we meet with? I kinda liked him.
How are you?
Hey, check me out, I'm a slut!
You want some help with that?
So, did you play in college? sweatshirt he's wearing.)
Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with Rachel we thought we'd go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving in with Phoebe.
Very good, so good.
Yeah!
Hi.
Hello? Hold on please. Joey, it's your mom.
Do you know what's a bad idea?
Yes, I want to change. And why-why don't you go down and get us a table?
Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay?
Not even close.
Oh that's my doodle of a ladybug, with a top hat. She's fancy.
You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.
You and me both.
Uh, good.
And for our two-week anniversary, he's gonna take me to his cousin's cabin for the weekend.
Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle?
Hey.
Oh my God Chandler! I can't believe it!
How about a Youhoo with a funny straw?
Easy Rach, we'll find it. Won't we!
Emily's straight.
Joey, we have something to tell you.
How do you know exactly what she's going through?
What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!
I didn't change!
You sat back and let him have her, you didn't fight at all. Am I right? Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily?
Hi.
How about Mockolate mousse?
Well, what's the job?
She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.
What did you just say?
I'm fine, just a little tired, I'm okay. How's Richard doing?
Tonight?
Alright, alright, alright...
Oh God!
'Dear Dr. Remore, know that I love you and would do anything to have you.' Gosh. 'Your not-so-secretive admirer, Erica Ford.' Ooh wait, 'PS enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.'
Yeah.
Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be so terrible? Even if we were friends who lived together. Or, maybe someday friends who stood up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever.
There's still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet?
Really? I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. You're gonna have to figure this one for yourself. All right? Y'know what? If you're too afraid to be in a real relationship, then don't be in one.
Oh...
Hello, Chandler.
Oh my God.
When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?
Yeah you will! And, are you kiddin' me?!
Oh good, Lenny and Squigy are here.
All right, it'll be great! You just make her think you wanna have sex with her! It'll totally freak her out!
Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a whole new one because uh, you see, I-I, I put the wrong name again. 'cause um...
No, I'm wearing a wedding dress.
'Scuse us
Quick, Phoebe, tell us before he can swallow.
Chandler, please, come on. Look at him.
Well no wait a minute that's not true! No, what did, that was really sweet. And it kinda works out for the best.
Last night.
Yeah, sweetie.
I got you a present!
Come on, no peeking!
No it's not, it's second.
What if I have babies, okay? I mean I'm gonna look different. I'm okay with that, but I'm not sure that you are!
A quin pidio el pollo General Tso?
"Hi, it's Monica. I'm just checking in 'cause I got this message from you and I didn't know if it was old or new or what. So, I'm just checkin'. So let me know, or don't, whatever. I'm breezy."
Okay. I gotta call Michelle. I gotta see if that was her voice or not. I'm sorry, I just have to.
Hey!
Nothing.
Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Eric Estrada. And ZXY becuase I think it sounds zexy.
Ow!!!!!!! Ow-ow-ow-ow!
Uh, Michelle. Yeah, that was me, I-I dialed your number by mistake. Oh, you're so sweet. Yeah, we were a great couple. I know I really miss him. Well, you know how it is, it's that....
Why not?
You realize what you are don't you?
Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!
Morning.
No, Chandler's still in Phase One, and Joey's that thing you smell.
Is this the one that I threw out last year?
That was you?
That can't be your father.
Well?
Probably the only time I'll ever say this, but did you see the ass on her?
Yeah!
I know, I've been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don't you think?
That is sooo not true!
No, but she likes me. You abandoned her on a plane to Greece.
See? They're as different as night and... later that night.
She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
You bet your ass, I'm gonna fire you! Thank you.
Oh, would you let it go already?! You're fine!
Hey!
Oh, my mom called, they're gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper, so we're looking for a good picture of us.
Rachel!! Come on! Let me in!
One two three.
I can't believe it! What is it? Is it the rubbing or the smell?
Wow! It's really red! You should go see my eye doctor.
Still, I was quick as a cat.
Ross? Let's go.
You wanna be in charge of the food committee?
Well, you tell a lot of jokes!
Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?
I make the decisions, and I say no.
Phoebe, tell her!
Ross, I can't believe you'd do that!
Who has her own little desk when Roland's not there.
Okay, just wait, please. I promise we'll come up with something. Just give us a little more time.
So, are you sorry that I told them?
Well, maybe you don't need them.
Joey, take your time with that. That's my last batch.
Yes that would be lovely.
And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!
You know what? You're right.
No! No-no they're not. They're still very angry! But y'know Chandler is also half-Swedish. You know what the Swedish people are famous for? Sitting down and being quiet.
Okay.
Oh my God.
Rach, he's a friend of ours.
I love you, Pete!!!
Yeah, yeah, and you were going him y'know, your flower.
I'll get it. Hello. Hi Emily! Yeah, uh you-you tracked him down. Hold on one second.
I can't believe you did that.
You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.
Well, what happened?
C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life.
Really.
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't do this.
The Richard.
You don't? Well, that's the difference between a professional and a layman.
Ross, are you okay?
Would you look at them?
Yeah, good for you. Y'know you're tough, you lived on the streets.
Wait, Joey! Joey! That doesn't mean that-that you're in love with me!
Chandler!
Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!
Wow.
Hey!
Uh-oh! Uh-oh!
Hey!
Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.
Wow! Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away!
Yes, you're having a boy!
You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and move on! It's nothing to freak out about.
Ohh, Please?! I'm a single mom, with a thirty year old son!!
I don't remember. Do you wanna take a walk?
In the beginning where y'know it's all sex and talking and sex and talking and...
Wait. Rachel, no, he's married. Married! If you don't realise that, I can't help you.
I don't know. Rachel I'm-I'm sorry that I hurt your ankles.
Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?
Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point.
I'm so happy for me.
So, I went down to the post office, and it turns out it was those videos that I ordered for Richard about the Civil War. He loved the Civil War.
Wow!
That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!
Where you can make out with your assistant.
Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.
Um-hmm.
I thought that was a good thing.
Yeah! Roses or Lilies?
What did you do to his sweater vests?
Yeah, I do know.
Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.
We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got cookie dough, we got Twister...
Yeah. Anyway, he told me about your apartment. And, um, I couldn't sleep, thinking about it. So, uh, would it be okay if I cleaned it?
Baddest. Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown.
Hey, you know I got a question for ya. Just a little thing, no pressure.
Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!
Rach?
Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.
Not necessarily...
Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic , in Central Park!
Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker another try. Shall we, ladies?
What?
We have one.
The fake kind!
Break!
Let me get you some coffee.
Oh hi! Hi! Y'know, we were just talking about bacon.
I swear I've seen birds do this on Wild Kingdom.
Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. Haven't you?
I'll take it down to 95% but that's the best I can do.
This woman's living my life.
She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.
Yes.
I'm in the shower!
Joey!
Score!! 7 to nothing!
The Luisa from home room!
Fine! Judge all you want to but, married a lesbian, left a man at the altar, fell in love with a gay ice dancer, threw a girl's wooden leg in a fire, livin' in a box!!
Okay, I got it. Phoebe? All right, you pull. I'm gonna spread the legs as wide as I can. Joey? Now is not the time!
Hoyt?
Keep talking.
Hey!
Honey! Dinner's ready!
Joey!!
You can't say that!! You-you don't know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn't...bend that way. So...
Isn't this great?
Paul!
Please. Half the guys out there have makeup on.
No! We're gonna have fun. We can make fudge!
What?!
Chandler, please don't think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel...
Yeah, I knew.
Hey.
One-Mississippi. Two-Mississippi. Three-Mississippi.
The green dress? Really?
Okay..
Did he give you that whole "You're-not-up-to-this" thing again?
Okay. Don't you want a cookie?
Phoebe, do you want to go see a movie after dinner tonight?
He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.
No! Rachel is meeting us here.
Hexadrin.
Phoebe, stop writing about us!
Ha-ha!
It's enough for wedding scenario eight.
Hi.
Oh my God, sit down! Sit down! How long as it been since we've seen each other?
Did you just smell my hair?
Guys, you got your hair cut.
Ross!
I don't know, I lost it all ok. I lost it.
You were invited?!
What?! What is it?
Friday's perfect...She can't wait.
Wow! It's like Rachel in High School.
Okay, Joey's gonna catch it, and you and I are gonna block.
Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
You got it.
I don't know exactly. It's-it's sorta like wrestling.
If Phoebe were my maid of honor...
Uh-huh.
Um, I'm not actually Amish.
Absolutely.
Ok.
Whoa whoa whoa! Where're you goin'?
Hey Pheebs, how's it going?
Oh, I don't know. Maybe, um, "That was nice?" Admit something to me? "I'll call you?"
I know! I'll tell you something, we are gonna do that again!
Y'know, maybe it's best that we never got to do it again.
Shut up, and put my table back.
Y'know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I... We just have to get it over with! Y'know, the next time we see them we're just gonna tell them. Okay? That's it.
Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I'm the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed.
Okay, if you really wanna have sex...
You become friends after?
It will not be fine. We'll get in trouble.
Well, we're trying to find someone to perform our wedding and they're all either boring or annoying or y'know, can't stop staring at the ladies.
You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you.
Oh, is everything in the car?
No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean the chance to star in a movie? Come on!
We got out pictures back from London. Here's all of us at the Tower of London.
How about, you're moving!!
Ohh!
Rachel! Rachel! You haven't touched Eldad's hair!
Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones. I just did it so my Mom wouldn't give me grief about me biting them.
Honey, having a heart attack is nature's way of telling you to slow it down.
Hey!
We'll discuss it, in the morning!
The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!
Really?
All right, biggest suite in the place. Come on!
We're really sorry, but um, she did ask us first.
You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!
You wanted it to be a surprise.
Please, when he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and I saw you eat a cheeseburger.
Come on.
I know, how can you not be accross the hall anymore.
Well, it just seems like a really small number.
Yeah. Where were you?
I'm checking out the restaurant with Pete.
No it is not!
It's good to see you
I miss Rachel. No, my parents.
Oh, let's not tell this story.
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna miss you!
I don't know! Time to kiss a guy maybe?! What are you laughing at Pampers?
What, forget it!
Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?
You're an opthamologist.
No.
Alright, I'll tell you what. I'll come get you in 5 minutes with some sort of um, kabob emergency.
Ok...ay.
Hey, umm, so listen umm, my friends were telling me a little about this ah, ultimate fighting thing and it, well it sounds really dangerous. I-I don't want you to get hurt, 'cause I kinda like you.
All right ah, Ross, this is the extent of my knowledge on the subject. Call Rachel.
I'm really getting tired of sneaking around.
Are you all right?
Okay!
Did you ever, uh, like, think about the future?
That's right baby! Okay, what do I want now?
For what?
No! I'm not okay!
Fifteen minutes.
Y'know, there's a Starbucks about three blocks down.
Hey, did you pick a roommate?
Oh, wait a minute honey.
You, and you, you're supposed to be at my party. And Gunther! What are you doing here?
Let me ask you a question.
What? Wait! Why? Chandler! Chandler! Wait! I'm sorry, I was just playing for one second! I was trying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see Richard again, I won't! He means nothing to me!
Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.
Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love! I mean, I get all those presents without having to talk to people I don't even like!
Well, um, look I-I don't want this to come our wrong, but ah, you seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasn't attracted too.
Phoebe, I thought you said you know what you're doing?
Hey.
OK, I'll see you later babe.
I mean think about all the money that you're gonna make!
Uh-huh.
You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I can't believe I lost 2 minutes.
Soakin' up all the culture.
Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned.
Ross, thats my jacket.
Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?
Come on, we can't let them win!
A-ha!!!
Okay.
Yeah right.
Hello? It's Joey. I'm so glad you called! Chandler told me what happened. Y'know he's really upset about it.
Phoebe, it's been two days.
You owe me 20 bucks.
Chandler! Chandler! I just figured out who you are!
All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7, ...7.....7...7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7...!
Don't worry about it.
No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff!
Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew. What? To me that's nice.
I can't believe this!
All right, all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some rearranging. But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar!
No, here's your mail.
How hammered are you? Huh? These, these are Joey's sisters.
Well that's pathetic!
We all chipped in.
Ross, I hated you when we were kids.
I don't want a beer.
He's with Emily at a Bed and Breakfast in Vermont!
I'm, I'm really sorry.
Does it involve travel?
Ennnh.
Joey, what are you doing? You promised Phoebe you wouldn't eat meat until she has the babies!
I've gotta get back in the game.
Hi sweetie, look before I forget, did I leave my diaphram at your place? Hi mom.
Why don't you just go out with her!
Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit. Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!
Mmmm, no.
Yeah. In fact, I like her so much you tell her I want my cookies early this year! Y'know, a box of Thin Mints and some Tag-a-Longs.
Got the keys? or Got the keys!
Oh my God, she's not gonna like the chicken that night either is she?!
Shut up.
Happy birthday!!!
Uh-huh.
Wow. That is not a happy hi.
Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn't cry. She wasn't angry or sad.
That's very funny!
Chandler is such an idiot!
Which?
Well, high school was not my favourite time.
What?!!
Heyyy!! You got the door open!!
Where ya going?
What are you talking about?
Okay fine! Fine! Then you know what, I'll just write about Phyllis! Hmm!
Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...
Are you through with that?
Oops.
How does that laugh not give you a headache?
Okay, this one I like!
I was kidding.
Ohh, of course we are! We left it up to fate. If we were supposed to get married there would be a clear-cut sign.
You're not a senior?
I'm sorry that I borrowed your gloves
Yeah, I saw him waiting for an elevator.
Oh, it is sooo perfect. Thank you so much.
People! People say it! Come here!
I knew you were not okay with that.
Yes? ..yes, she is.
Larry?
Good! Now, take those salads to table 4, And you! Get the swordfish! And you! Get a haircut!
'A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green'.
Ahh! Aren't you dressed yet?
Oh, Chantal!
Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this, so that you can bunny bump against my back.
Sixty guests.
Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.
...I can imagine.
A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here. From now on, it is gonna be my way, or the highway! All right? Does anybody have a problem with that?!! Hey new guy! I said, does anybody have a problem with that?!
Isn't that mine?
Yeah, but I don't think we have time.
What?! Oh.
Hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! Okay? That's a, that's a pretty great dad.
Rachel, it's a world where Joey is a neuro-surgeon.
What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!
I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.
I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but it's true, I love him too.
I would love too, but I can't! I mean I just can't, you know that I'm not good at confrontation.
Of course we will, come on we gotta make dinner.
I love you.
Maybe I do! I'm pretty feisty!
Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies!
Okay, while we're waiting for these pills to kick in, I'm gonna sit you down on the couch. Come on. Get some nice soft pillows under your head, I'm gonna turn the TV on and you can watch whatever you want. And I'm-Sit down--gonna make you some tea. And then, I'm gonna rub your feet.
Do you?
Huh?
No-no, I-I really don't want to talk about it! I don't! Especially with you.
What was her name?
Okay, you're fine.
Continue.
Sure.
Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out.
Oh.
You know what, everything's gonna be okay.
Dad, dad this is a good thing for me. Ya know, and you even said yourself, you've never seen Richard happier.
Ross, I thought you were over this.
Okay.
Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! My vision's been compromised!! Oh God! Okay. Okay. It's okay. Man, that was close.
Frozen lasagnas?
So I'm not supposed to share my doubts and fears with the guy I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with?
Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpaper's a little faded, that's okay. Carpet's a little loose. Hardwood floors!!
Yeah, she's here. Hold on a second.
Oh. Well, I didn't realize that you needed it back right away. I mean, you told me to go and be a caterer. So I went. I beed. I mean, I... I used it to buy all this stuff. But look-I've got another job tomorrow, so I'll pay you back with the money I make from that.
You're gonna what?
Well forget it! It doesn't hurt that baaad!!!!
How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and I'll make you a nice martini.
What was it for?
The muscles from Brussels, wham bam Van Damme, did you see Time Cop?
You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.
You're supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I mean, what's-what's the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?
I know, but look at me all tan.
Hey baby.
What?
Oh, we're not doing that. Okay...
What?
Hello? Oh, hi Wendy! Yeah, eight o'clock. What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... OK, great. All right, I'll see you then. Bye.
Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.
Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?
What did you say?
I like that. What?
Oh, thank you.
That, you get? That, you get?
Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him?
Honey. Uh, not to sound too Florence Henderson but, dinner's on the table.
Oh, absolutely. Yeah, you know I'm not even thinking about that thing that we're not supposed to think about.
This would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but I wouldn't put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there! I mean you'd have the ceremony under this big beautiful arch.
Oh my God. He threw up?
Well...I'd better get going.
Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.
I do?
Oh, well... um, that's all there are of these. But in about eight and a half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets.
Well, you could actually go to the gym.
Great!
Ethan?
Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast.
Oh, we have some...
See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now that's something.
What?
Nooo!
Ross, we can handle this.
Am not!
Really?
No Joey, I think he's just watchin' TV.
Ah no, you see, someone was supposed to take them down around New Years... but obviously someone forgot.
Phoebe, you are a bad ass!
This baby has got everything. Take y'know, locations for instance. First, organized alphabetically, then geographically, then by square footage.
I mean I-I don't I think I have enough quarters.
Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.
It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the shin.
Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.
Oh, here.
Oh my God! You still have the Chipper!
I hate this game!
I won't care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here.
Look Rach, we have to move. I mean if they had lost, we would've made them get rid of the birds. Right?
Ok, everybody, there's food and drinks on the table. Go across the hall.
Rach? What are you doing?
What happened to Janine?
I wanted it so bad! Wanna go pack?
What?!
Do you not remember the puppet guy?
Cassie needs to stay at your place.
Uh, so anyway, we thought one of you could read something during the ceremony.
Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun! Ohhh!
Do you want to go out on a date with her?
Oh yeah, she didn't hire me out of pity, it wasn't so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks I'm good.
I was frustrated.
Wow Joey, this is, uhh...
Oh!
You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... twenty dollars an hour.
Y'know what? It really creeps me out choosing other people's sex clothes.
So you can like, bite, and pull people's hair and stuff?
Hey!
Really? Okay, so why don't you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland?
Really! All right? Let's forget about this going home stuff and celebrate our anniversary. Okay, this is empty.
No, you cannot.
Umm, Chandler, if you want I can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner.
This is all of your things.
So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.
The players.
You know, I knew a girl in high school who did that. She was very popular.
What about these? These look the same?
Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding.
How-how did that happen?
Hey! I didn't know either.
OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.
What's up?
That's okay, this is more important than fruit on my ceiling! You broke up?!
I know you do. Me too. So what now?
Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you.
Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?
What are you talking about?
Guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it!
Whoa! Are you okay?
Hey!
Maybe.
Yeah. It's my dad's birthday, I decided to give him a stroke.
And people will think you own a Porsche because you're wearing the clothes?
Really?!
Oh good, I think so too. Pheebs?
Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over.
Have you seen Chandler?
Joey, she was listing the countries she's done it in.
Hi!
Okay.
What are you doing?
I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. You know, I say we blow off the dates.
Oh yeah, picked a guy, 37135.
I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. And now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets.
Say it louder, I don't think the guy all the way in the back heard you!
Oh.
You don't have any stuff.
Maybe Joey doesn't have to give you the money, TV stars have assistants right?
Bye!
No.
I can't believe it! That there is no money for my wedding?!
Well, it's like that. With feelings.
Ohh! Umm, Phoebe, I kinda need to talk to you about that. Umm, well I-I-I think it might be time for me to take a step back from catering.
I'm just saying, if we put just a little bit of makeup on you.
Thanks.
Look at you, you won't even look at him.
Well, I guess now we can't go.
You are insane! You-you gotta give this up!
I'm just having one of those days where you realize you're in a dead-end relationship!
Y'know those are a delicacy in India.
What?!
In case it happens.
Sperm.
What?!
Hey, cheer up! You're gonna see her again, right?
Wow!
We'll be right there! Can't you just say it starts later?
Okay, but there is a wire back there! I mean that switch is connected to something!
007 gets all the ladies.
Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a penny. Let's stock up.
Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement!
And you're cute too.
Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7 ...7.....7...7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7...!
No! No!
Why do I have to decide?
Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too. So even if you're horrible, how would I know?
Hard 8?! We should call it easy 8!
Unless...
Okay, good! Okay, what do I want now?
She has to know that your not ready.
Yes you did! You did like a little hop.
Chandler! You don't have to ask for my permission. You can go.
How are you still single?!
I can't wait to be with you! I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
Here!
Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?
Bobby and I are going away for the weekend, remember?
I know.
No, I just I think that it's too soon.
No. See you don't understand.
Oh, I'm sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.
We are! Help us!
Come on Ben.
He's retiling my floor.
What do you mean?
I said we are not going to do it, okay? Sometimes you can be such a, a big baby.
Wait a minute. I thought last night was great.
All right, I've got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but umm, I'm getting the feeling that you don't want to deliver.
Yeah, well, I'm using noise. Okay. All right! So, is everybody ready? Here we go. I hear something! I hear something! Where is it?
You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
Alright that's great, then just go. Go Knicks.
See yeah umm, you kinda stole my thunder!
But getting over was the hardest thing that I've ever had to do. And I never let myself think about you.
Well, we certainly are alone.
She is unbelievable, our mother is...
Okay, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I-I-I was um, I was taking a nap.
Were not doing anything. Were just sitting around talking, quietly.
So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?
Now, are you glad we didn't start with the bikini strips?
No! Y'know, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land, fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together.
What-what are you doing?
Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park.
What the hell happened?!
The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!
Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.
What?
Okay. I can do that.
Good for you, Joey.
I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!
Please! I made this game what it is.
Yeah!
Yeah, it did.
Well actually, Ross doesn't.
Well umm, we were just talking about the y'know, the Swing Kings and just wondering whether y'know, they were the right way to go.
Ah!
Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!
Ross they're really, really, really white.
What are you doing?!
Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...
Are you sure he didn't break it because it really hurts.
Why did you hire me?
I know!!
Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work?
There's my little boy.
That counts!
Did you also have his album, It's Not Easy Being Green?
If the school finds out you're fired.
I'm outa here.
Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.
Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!
Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?
What are you guys gonna do?
Are you okay?
Joey! He's working! You would look good in that.
No! Oyster?
What does she mean by 'involved'?
I mean, was it Gina?
Thank you.
So do you think that these pictures-Are, are they trying to tell a story?
Wow! And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up.
What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else?
Maybe we should just tell your parents first.
Well no, but um.
Was it really that good?
Oh.
Hand me those tomatoes, I'm gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.
Oh. Big family dinner tonight?
Hi. Richard just told me he loves me.
Oh, I'm so glad you guys like it. Yay! All right I gotta go to work.
You know, the guys are probably having a great time.
Didn't your dad used to call you Pumpkin?
Hey guys!
I give good massages! I used to give them to Rachel all the time before she got allergic! And-and-and Chandler loves them! Watch!
Matt Guire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wire...
Wait Chandler, what are you doing?!
Phoebe?
Let's do it!
Why?!
Okay, ready?
Hi!
It's not a date, okay. I'm just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.
No, I don't even know how serious he is about me. Until I do, I'm not telling them anything.
I just wanted to see how it's going.
Hi, Josh.
I think it's romantic.
Have you seen Chandler?!
I can cook and you can take care of the money.
Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. I've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate.
Phoebe.
I hear ya. Excuse me for just a second!
Clogs.
Really?
I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.
So what! As long as he's not wearing a white dress and a veil I don't care.
Hey, the man's dog just died.
Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school with, 'cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else? Like you, I don't even know where you work?
Of course there's another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you have to prove your love!
Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on down! Okay, he's 6'2", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis.
They're still in my coat.
Oh, y'know what, I can't, it really kills.
Well yeah.
You're welcome.
Weird, weird.
That doesn't seem fair.
What are you doing with those?!
No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four!
So then, are you going to dump Jason?
Aww, sweetie, but it's not like you're not gonna have anything. You're gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways that's even better.
Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?
Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?
Besides, it takes the focus off the hat.
Are you sure?
Excuse me, where are you going?
You know, that guy she met at the coffeehouse.
All right, we'll call you when we get back.
You made a joke right? So I laughed.
Dr. Burke, it, it's me.
Curry.
Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are yours.
Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man?
What is it?!
You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card.
If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call.
Hold on.
Really?
All right, listen up. There is usually only one dress in each size so when they open those doors, fan out. Now, this is what you're looking for! Memorize it! When you locate the dress, blow on these. All right? Three short blasts, when you hear it. Come running.
Ooh, this always happens.
Plus, everyone's gonna see your thing.
Yeah, you should.
I got you the foot massager.
Bye.
Noo!! It's driving me crazy. I mean every other way he's like the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything.
Who? Two divorces and Joey?!
I think so. Se, he-he's not inviting you to his party because he likes you.
Well I'm Monica Geller, ball like a baby.
Hey, did you guys know, that your oven doesn't work?
That's not true, there are great pictures of us!
Yeah.
Oh that's great!
Did they just kill off Joey?
Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan.
I think somebody needs another lap dance.
Come on, get into bed! I want to prove to you that I'm not sick! I wanna make you feel, as good as I feel.
Sorry we're late.
Oh, my pleasure.
Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.
I knew it!! Y'know, you're not so quiet yourself, missy!
Oh, he's sober alright. Just turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason.
That's it big girl! Come on!
Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?
What?!?!
Like?
Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance!
You have to go to London!
All right umm, a string quartet for the procession.
"Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know." Nooo!!
Wait a minute, Phoebe! We should be partners. We should be catering partners. I mean, think about it! You're not working right now, and we have such a great time together!
Yeah!
I love you.
No that is not what happened with us. Well, I was umm, I was really sad that night because this guy that I was Ross's mom.
Relieved?
Hi Pheebs, what's up?
What?! You can't-what did you tell her?
All right.
Shhh!
No.
Oh my god.
You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?
A kiss? What are you talking about?
Fair? Please don't even talk to me about fair! Fair would've been you wanting to marry me back then! Or fair would've been Chandler wanting to marry me now! Believe me, nothing about this is fair! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!
Chandler, this actually bothers you?
He's seeing someone. I can't believe he's seeing someone.
And who pays for that?
Yeah, he's gonna work on that.
Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!
That's because I-I was just grabbing some things out of the dryer, and it's static cling. Or maybe it's just that God knew I'd be running into you and saw an opportunity.
What the hell is that dog doing here?!
Wait, no-no-no, I can go really fast! Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche!
I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night!
We'll be waiting for you...
Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!
No you robot!!
Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So...
Okay, look, this could be a really long game.
You look cute in bubbles.
Because they don't know we're dating. Do you think we should eat in the kitchen?
I think so too.
No.
No, don't say it! Don't even think it!
Wow, those pills really worked, huh?
That is wild.
Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir? Why? What did I say?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I-I should probably leave you girls alone.
Joey!
Hi.
Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can.
Richard!
Umm, well, he's...
Are you sure?
I think it's a great idea. Yeah, we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends.
Toe the line. Thread the needle. Think outside the box!
Wow! Look At This! I Can'T Believe I Even Fit Into This Shirt! Oh, this is yours.
'Cause I ran into him at the bank, he is still soo cute.
Yeah, sure.
Sush!! I cannot believe she is still up there.
Oh God, maybe he won't see us. Richard!
No-no-no that was good, it was, that was uh, that was a goood kiss...
We'd be eating our soup right now.
Would you stop? We've only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don't even know if he's gonna propose.
It's my New Year's resolution!
Uh-huh.
Hey.
There was just one woman, wasn't there?
Then all your stuff would be here.
It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.
Wow, come in, have a seat. You must be exhausted coming all the way from...Texas.
Okay! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, we're gonna start with...
Come on, she'll be here any minute.
Why do you need it?
Oh-ho, look what I got Julio.
No-no-no! We need something old!
I'm sorry..
My God! Is this a gym card?
Alright. Just keep him away from me.
Oh crap!
Oh, God forbid.
Hi guys.
Hi, who's this? Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. Joanne, it's not as simple as all that, ok? No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve.
