We have one.
You bought a boat?
Okay.
No, we don't.
All right then, your bra would still be big.
What happened to your teeth.
NOW!!!!!!!!
All right, all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some rearranging. But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar!
Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just didn't give him enough.
All right, you!
Deal!
Hon, you gotta talk to Joey.
How about a Youhoo with a funny straw?
Wow, Monica! What an amazing opportunity to influence... dozens of people.
The best man? Wow!
Huh, wanna bet?
OK, wait, wait, wait, wait. You know what? Ross, let's - let's switch places. You get in the middle. No un-, ya know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something up.
Ooh, and I can do this.
Because you're on my team! And my team always wins!
Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So...
Okay, but there is a wire back there! I mean that switch is connected to something!
I know.
Nothing, I just heard something nice about you.
You too.
Come on! It wasn't that bad!
You're right, you're right I shouldn't freak out. 'Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!
Oh! You're awake!
What does she mean by 'involved'?
Okay, this one I like!
Hey, check me out, I'm a slut!
Yeah, once again, I am sorry. Thank you. Bye. I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different.
Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over.
Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?
Don't say it.
Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3, macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs.
What am I gonna do?! That is the dress! That is the dress! Wh...Chandler wants the band. What do I do?
It's not like I want to get married tomorrow! It's just that I-I'd like to believe that I'm in a relationship that's actually going somewhere, that I'm not just wasting my time!
You realize what you are don't you?
Yes you did. Absolutely.
Wait, what about the time I hit you in the face with the Silvian's pumpkin?
No! No!
I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.
Is that all?
Give it to me.
Hi.
Hey Pheebs, how's it going?
You're not gonna be phased out!
Are you okay?
Ross's apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more often?
Joey, you had the night!
No.
Well, um, look I-I don't want this to come our wrong, but ah, you seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasn't attracted too.
He's seeing someone. I can't believe he's seeing someone.
Fine! Judge all you want to but, married a lesbian, left a man at the altar, fell in love with a gay ice dancer, threw a girl's wooden leg in a fire, livin' in a box!!
Brrrrrrr!
Wait! Wait! This isn't take-out!
I can't believe you married Duncan. I mean how could you not tell me? We lived together, we told each other everything.
We both do that!
Fine!
Huh. So you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad massage, well who would get that?
Isn't this great?
How have you been?
What-what are you doing? Is this supposed to be funny?
So how does it look?
Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., "I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren." was what? A wrong number?
Chandler what do you say?
Rose Marie really belongs on a smaller screen, doesn't she?
Oh, it is sooo perfect. Thank you so much.
Oh look, the pool table's free. Rack 'em up. I'll be back in just a minute. Get ready for me to whip your butt.
Yeah, it did.
Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!
Phoebe why don't you just call her? You obviously want to.
See? It's no big deal.
What is that?
Have you found your dress yet?
I am good. I finished my book.
Hey, you got me, put it in.
No!
This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.
Hey, how long are you in the city?
What?! I just touched him and he went over.
Would you stop? We've only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don't even know if he's gonna propose.
It's beautiful! It's like the first bathroom floor there ever was. Whoa! Are you going in there for?
Oh, it was great! The widow wouldn't pay, so Phoebe yelled at her 'til she did.
No, although now that's what I'm thinking.
Uh, would you stop it with that already?!
I'm gonna miss you!
I know!!
Yeah, okay, give that a try!
Alright. Phoebe?
Yes! Why, did you-you forget to make yours?
Oh, c'mon in.
Yeah, I saw him waiting for an elevator.
And so, we're hiding in the bathroom.
Don't come in here!
Absolutely! Now get out of here you!! Okay, I'm running out of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there's no future? Either they're too old, or they're too young, and then there's Pete who's-who's crazy about me, and who's absolutely perfect for me, and there's like zip going on! I mean, seriously, does it sound like something's wrong with me?!
What are you doing here? I thought you had to do inventory all day.
All right look, if I take Chandler out of the running will you be able to focus?
Are you kidding me?! Is this; is this turning you on?
I know.. it's gonna be really hard.
Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we.
Rach, did you check the machine?
Oh.
Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?
All right.
Is-is-is there a-a Mrs. Stevens?
Did you go home and change?
Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about. It's about being with the people that you love.
Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan.
I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!
Yeah, it's just something I picked up.
Joey! He's working! You would look good in that.
I know!
What took you so long?
Yes! We found you a really cute and funny guy from Chandler's work!
Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!
Yeah baby!
Wow. Joey, how do you do it?
Boy, you are really not a morning person.
Really?
Oh yeah? When?
You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?! Why?! What-Why wouldn't you want me at your wedding? What could I have possibly done?! Stuart!
Okay!
Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!
OK. Just for a little while.
OK, here you go. Good luck.
Well umm, we were just talking about the y'know, the Swing Kings and just wondering whether y'know, they were the right way to go.
Oh... shoot.
When girls hang out, we don't have pillow fights in our underwear. I'm sorry. We do. We do. I don't know why I said that.
I'm sorry.
Strip Happy Days Game?
He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!
You guys are dead, I am so good at lighting rounds.
Alright, check.
Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card people.
Probably some y'know, European good-bye thing he picked up in London.
Did you like learn about her family?
Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in fact, I'm the one that's making him wait!
All right, y'know what? We really are late! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!!
I can't believe this!
That was me and Ross.
Oh my God! Well push it in! Push it in!
Cassie needs to stay at your place.
Count in our heads as-as good Madlibs.
Okay, if you need the vacuum, it's in my closet on the left-hand side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator...
Okay. Oh but Joey, come over later because I'm going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter.
Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?
But I thought you wanted to live by yourself.
Well, what's the job?
We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.
No! No-no they're not. They're still very angry! But y'know Chandler is also half-Swedish. You know what the Swedish people are famous for? Sitting down and being quiet.
Are you serious? Oh my God.
Hey, I made $17 before breakfast, what have you done?
He could hear me.
Joey!
You don't have to stick up for her. She can't here you.
Then what's the problem?
Y'know, I don't have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical. Are you sure you're okay?
Ohh! Did you do what I said? Did-did-did you tell her?
I didn't even tell him to say that. . All right you're off my list.
I'm sick of the signs! It's too fast, I'm happy the way things are!
Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping.
Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned.
What?!
She's my favorite character on DOOL.
Only here.
Yeah. Anyway, he told me about your apartment. And, um, I couldn't sleep, thinking about it. So, uh, would it be okay if I cleaned it?
You're not on TV.
And six others.
No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
Oh, absolutely. Yeah, you know I'm not even thinking about that thing that we're not supposed to think about.
Yes!
Yeah sure, nature called, she wanted to see who else did.
That's right. That's right. And that is why you can't stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn't come to the wedding.
Okay, I freaked out a little.
Um, I'm not actually Amish.
You bet.
Phoebe, it's okay that you don't want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.
I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys.
Oh, well don't take it to the same place you took the stereo, 'cause they've had that thing for over a week.
Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kind've competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Ross's nose.
Oh because it doesn't...really fit. Oh by the way, I-I booked the Swing Kings.
Oh that's great!
Oh, don't you guys look cute. You guys make such a cute couple.
What?! Why? Why is this crazy? So this isn't the ideal way to something....
Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
How desperate am I?
Hey, what's that?
Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for you yet.
What did you say?
Oh my God!
All right, all right, at least I'm prepared.
Hi.
But it didn't. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.
Sweetie, I think the glasses look great. They make you look really sexy.
That's right.
What?
I think his begging days are over now that he's going out with Nancy Branson.
Sixty guests.
OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.
Bye sweetie, I love you.
They were lovers.
Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!
Y'know, no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore.
Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class.
This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then- we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and "See you around!" Let's go, Phoebe.
No she hasn't.
They tore it down a few days early.
Oh, um, that was my bathing suit from high school. I was uh, a little bigger then.
You've got to be smooth about it.
Okay? Over here we have pink suede, which is nice. But umm, if it gets wet then you know it's gonna shrink.
Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it. You see Kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was weak physically. You get it now honey?
Are you crazy?!
Okay, I've got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?
Oh no, she's out having drinks with Carl.
Well, why would she lie to you?
Yeah, let-let-let's pretend that's not true.
Noo!! The point is that is was you that was there that night! It is you that I am marrying! It is you that I feel in love with!
What?!
Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner.
Hey Rach, come on! We're gonna be late for the eye doctor appointment!
Well, my financially challenged friends, I split my money and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY.
Wait, wait, wait!
You are not a freak. You're a guy.
Hey!
Wait a minute, who told you? You are dead meat.
You broke a little girl's leg?!!
Rachel, what are you doing? Its freezing out here. Would you come back inside?
Hey.
Did you just smell my hair?
He's retiling my floor.
Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?
So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.
They won't take you to the vet.
I like 'em.
Noooo! I'm lying. I am so drunk.
What?
It's wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.
Look, you and I went to different high schools...
Ohh.
What's this?
You got it.
Why is it sick?
So big deal, so Joey's had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn't mean he's great in bed.
Rach, does this have nonfat milk?
I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus?
Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Yeah you will! The right guy is just around the corner! Okay, are we done with that?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now.
You really think this is okay?
All right, you ready?
Well, you used to dress up in Mom's clothes all the time.
Did I squeeze it too hard?
I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe and she's the only one left!
Okay! Very funny! Somebody let me out please?! Come on, I'm cold! And covered in marinara sauce! Come on! Let me out!
From here to the airport?
I can't live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?
That's a good call. Right.
I thought you were going out with Elizabeth.
Really?
I'm sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross.
Are you sure you wanna do this?
It's okay, it's okay.
Did that!
Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?
Oh my God.
Did you just flick me?
So what's Phoebe like?
I'm sorry that I borrowed your gloves
That's right.
Wait Chandler, what are you doing?!
How'd it go?
Ohh!
It's not like, I haven't any opportunities. I mean, y'know, I'm just waiting for the perfect guy. I'm seeing this guy Roger, all right? He's not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with. Y'know, give him my flower.
You did not go!
Phoebe, he's a friend of my parents. He's like 20 years older than me.
Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion.
Oh no, it is okay, I mean as long as you know that Chandler and I are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! I mean our flame, whew, is on fire!
Hey!
Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you.
Really! All right? Let's forget about this going home stuff and celebrate our anniversary. Okay, this is empty.
Hello? Oh yes, one minute please. It's for you. It's the fire inspector.
Joey, you're this guy's teacher. I mean how could you do this?
I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it.
Wow! You made a profit!
Yes, but you are dead inside.
Really? Why?
Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon.
So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica?
No! Phoebe!
Yeah, I think that fifth shower actually got the interview off me.
Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on down! Okay, he's 6'2", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis.
All I say is, she better get the job.
Ross.
Good. What made you change your mind?
Okay, now we just need something borrowed!
Fine, I'll rub it on myself.
Pretty much.
Y'know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I... We just have to get it over with! Y'know, the next time we see them we're just gonna tell them. Okay? That's it.
What? We could do it!
Okay. Let's bring it in.
Thank you.
Well maybe we can make a, a, a 'B' out of one of those roses.
Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?
He said he's really gonna miss you guys.
Hey!
Put your head back.
I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. You know, I say we blow off the dates.
Hey sweetie.
I loved them!
Okay, good! Okay, what do I want now?
We're good.
Joey, this is you!
Gimme them!
All right, I'll try not to.
Oh my God it's old!
Oh, Rachel, sweetie, look, here's a really cute picture of Joey and you at the reception.
No-no, wait! Just let me finish, okay? This isn't something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. And it is going to happen.
Look at you! Come here! Feel better?
He's a dropper!
Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!
It's not a date, okay. I'm just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.
Well, the giraffe's okay. And so is the pirate.
Sorry, Rach.
You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you.
Ohh that's sweet!
Oh, you came to tell him you love him! I knew it! I was right! I'm right, right?
I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night!
Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means something!
I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up there to yell and then I end up apologizing to him.
All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts.
Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years.
Hey. It's him. Who is it?
Yes there is! He's black and white and shaggy and he's sitting next to Rachel and licking Rachel's hand.
Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.
Y'know, I-I... I have to figure...some st-Y'know, some stuff before I can...
You didn't.
Yes!!
Stupid.
You really think this is okay?
Yeah, apparently they're turning it into some kinda coffee place.
Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.
No.
Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe's old massage place is getting fired.
We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got cookie dough, we got Twister...
Oh! And don't let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.
She's bluffing!
GET OUT YOU DUFUS!!
Do you know anything about women?
Alright.
300 dollars?!
We have a ladle.
Oh stop it. Joey already told me.
We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man!
Rachel! That was a library card!
Why?!
What're you gonna do?
That's right Patrick, bye-bye!
Honey, what's the matter?
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't do this.
No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean the chance to star in a movie? Come on!
How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?
If someone wants to give us a present, we don't want to deprive them of that joy.
Hi.
So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don't really believe that do you?
No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about.
Phoebe, don't worry about it. I'm sure she wants to live with you.
Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time to get a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to London, there could be a line at customs! Come on!!
Oh, not at all. I have no morals and I need the cash.
Ross, don't start.
Oh-ho! But not in here! Can't eat 'em in bed, remember? No crumbies!
I know, it is isn't it?
All right. We're gonna go. It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.
Do you wanna live outside?! Because it's gettin' cold! She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she'll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I'd like.
Oh.
Whoa! Whoa!! Tackled by a girl! Bet ya don't see that everyday, do ya?
What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you want to fall into the trap?!
The green dress? Really?
Oh, I haven't had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler. Wow, I'm never gonna have that feeling again am I?
Third door on the left.
Hey guys! You found the presents? Chandler, you let them find the presents? Great! Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?
You can, I know you can!
You can spill. In the sink.
Oh my God! Oh my God!
That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.
Wow! A lipper from Chipper.
I read to you.
Oh he's nice. He's nice! Y'know, you always stick up for the people we fog!
Dad, I'm the twinkie.
You know, I knew a girl in high school who did that. She was very popular.
Don't do what?
I love you too Chandler.
Okay.
This is the most special day of our lives.
What?!
You're wrong! The centerpieces are fine! Do you ever get scared at all?
Ohhhh!
Hi!
Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too. So even if you're horrible, how would I know?
Come on, okay, come on this is for all womankind. Let's kill 'um!
Oh, thank you!
Dad , Mom . Look! Look who it is it's Chandler!
Well, it's like that. With feelings.
Your a poet and don't know it.
Joey that is so sweet.
Okay, I've broken them down into categories. Okay, we have uh, we got holidays, birthdays, candids, y'know... And then what I've done is I've cross-referenced them by subject. Right? So if you're looking up, oh let's say birthdays and dogs, you get Photo 152. See?
If you want.
I wanna say good-bye at the car!
You do know that was me who just said that right? Hey. As long as we're both up...
Oh no sweetie, no! This is my fault, I wasn't clear! I'm really sorry. And listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? There's absolutely no rush.
You're his bitch.
All right, that's it, we're going to the emergency room.
Where ya going?
What Phoebe meant to say was umm, how come you're having a party and we're not invited?
Paul!
I can't believe he has a new roommate. Who is this guy?
Oh. Why didn't you take her?
Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up?
All right uh, the important thing is to take your time, you want to hit 'em all, and you mix 'em up. You gotta keep them on their toes.
Chandler!!
You okay?
Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me. li-listen, Dad, I can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um... there's something that I've been meaning to tell you...
Hey!
Hey!
No! Umm well, some people say that Oysters are an aphrodisiac.
Okay, bye.
Hi. I'll be ready in just a second.
We have to do this. We are playing for women everywhere. Okay, just think about every lousy date that you ever had, okay, every guy who kept on the TV while you're making out...
I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.
Hey!
Promise me you'll be careful.
I'm sure they'll be here soon.
Yeah.
Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces?
I am really an idiot. you see, I was filling out my friend's form, and instead of putting her information, I put mine.
Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen. Don't do the dance.
Really? Okay, so why don't you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland?
Aunt Syl, stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna. Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape.
I think somebody needs another lap dance.
You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter.
Because! She's my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! We're family y'know? Well that's important to me.
Oh!
Yeah!
Wow!
Wow, this really sucks.
I am not high maintenance!
Oh God, you are about to get sooo lucky.
We're not doing anything.
Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the uh, real estate section...
Ok people, I want you to take a piece of paper, here you go, and write down your most embarassing memory. Oh, and I do ask that when you're not using the markers, you put the caps back on them because they will dry out.
Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?
You are so sweet to notice! Yes, I lost three and a half pounds!
Hmm.
Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother's? Wouldn't they have the recipe?
This doesn't feel weird!
This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again.
You start working on that list.
Chandler come on. We have to hem the new dust ruffle.
Hey. So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.
These tiny, little non-breasts?! Please, it's gotta be Rachel.
No!
What's wrong with PBS?
Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than-Ohhh!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.
Phoebe!
Mr. Heckles.
Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?
Okay! My turn! My turn!
Why do you want to see my hand?
Were not doing anything. Were just sitting around talking, quietly.
So Joey, why didn't you grow a moustache?
Come on! Surprise her! Show up at her doorstep! Don't let her go without a fight!
You've never met Bob, have you?
Why? It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?
I used to love to play restaurant.
Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?
Hi, nice to meet you!
I knew you were likely to take a wife!
Okay, I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted to do?
Okay.
I don't care.
What is it?
Wow, she must have hurt you pretty bad, huh?
Ross, I can't believe you'd do that!
And slept with the professor.
Hi.
Hey, it's Funny's cousin, Not Funny.
Why?
Sweetie, with you it's gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, 'cause you-you guys are in love.
Great. So the ball is in his court?
Why, do you write him a lot?
Nothing. Nothing.
How are you doing?
All right, look, I hate this as much as you, but if it makes you feel better, it's all your fault.
Here!
Yeah, well, I'm using noise. Okay. All right! So, is everybody ready? Here we go. I hear something! I hear something! Where is it?
Hold it! Are you talking about Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve?
He doesn't have anyone.
To score the winning touchdown, by the way.
No. Big deal, so you have a side of the bed, everybody has a side of the bed.
Ahhh!!
Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.
Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship!
I wanna wear this everyday.
Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room.
OK, how does everybody like their burgers?
Chandler! You don't have to ask for my permission. You can go.
All right, just trying to start an interesting discussion.
Well you should be embarrassed.
Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point.
Ross, we can handle this.
Really? Your work laugh?
Besides, if anybody's gonna get free stuff, it's gonna be me.
I mean, was it Gina?
Well, we don't really have to decide anything right now, do we?
Oh good.
Ross used to stay up every Saturday night to watch Golden Girls!
Ditch you? Phoebe, you were pregnant with the triplets!
Oh umm, how about your mom dying, or having to live on the streets when you were 14?
Limited seating my ass. Let's see who made the cut. Hi!
You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts, and then to top it off, I lost one of my fake boobs, in a grill fire.
Come on Ben.
Listen, I... I don't think this is the best time.
Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too.
So, what do you think we should do?
Maybe.
Because they don't know we're dating. Do you think we should eat in the kitchen?
No Phoebe, those are like the side affects and stuff.
Why don't you phase it out? Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you're, y'know, that you're adjusting to life in America.
Larry?
That's Bill Clinton.
If you're not going then I don't want to go either.
Oh, I already have one.
Toe the line. Thread the needle. Think outside the box!
As a thank you, Rachel and I will kiss for one minute.
Please, I'm not going for anything.
Okay, you ready to open yours?
Okay, does it involve something to do with Pete's computer company?
Well umm, Chandler and I are moving in together.
-leg?
Of course I wouldn't approve, I mean, you were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay. I mean, what the hell were you thinking?
What?
What the hell are you doing?!
No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!
Really?
Hi...May I help you?
Okay ah, please don't freak out. Umm, but ah, there's a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and there's no way to know which one.
Well?
Wow, is that Michelle?
Hey!
Phoebe, do you think that your favorite animal says much about you?
No! No, she doesn't. Uh Phoebe, what she makes-that's uh-they're sock rabbits. They are completely different-Okay! Okay! Okay! I didn't make it! I'm sorry! I totally forgot about tonight and the fact that we're supposed to make the presents!
Hey! My first review is out!
So then, are you going to dump Jason?
You know what. Tomorrow I'm gonna do your clocks.
Chandler!
I wish all guys could be like him.
Chandler, I said I was sorry.
Okay!
I'm changing out of this.
Change! Okay, sit down. Two seconds.
Oh.
Shut up, Joey!
Morning.
This isn't even my dress.
Chandler, what were you thinking?
Oh, Chantal!
Well, I think so.
Hi!
Yeah, well, is that better?
I knew you were not okay with that.
But my clothes are-ohh!
Okay.
Edward Nevski?
Fresh cookies! Hot from the oven!
It's Fun Bobby.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?
How many?
So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?
This is my dress!
No. See you don't understand.
I highly doubt that.
No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four!
Phoebe?
I need two. I'm bringing Pete. My boyfriend. I have a boyfriend now!
You know, it's a really funny story how this happened.
Who? Two divorces and Joey?!
You know!
Oh, that's too bad.
Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...
Sometimes we were.
Isn't that great?
No.
Any woman would be lucky to have ya.
Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago.
Oh, sorry.
Congratulations!
Phoebe, your liver is right here.
Okay. I-I can't watch.
Hey, did you get the turkey basted-Oh my God! Oh my God! Who is that?
No, you messed it up. You're stupid.
Hey-hey, how goes the dancing? Gay yet?
Ok, this is pumpkin pie with mockolate cookie crumb crust. This is mockolate cranberry cake, and these are mockolate chip cookies. Just like the Indians served.
Okay, good luck!
But, I just cleaned the bathroom.
You don't have the guts.
I'm sorry?
Oh my God!
What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
What?! You slept with Jason?
When two people finally realise their feelings for each other, and-and they talk for hours, and they-they learn all about the other person!
Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?
Oh, please.
Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school with, 'cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else? Like you, I don't even know where you work?
Oh, sure it does! In high school, you weren't jealous at all even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you!
Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!
Phoebe, do you want to go see a movie after dinner tonight?
Because it's my apartment!
Okay well that's good to know.
No.
Well, don't 'cha wanna?
What's up?
Yes.
Okay!
Noo!! Okay!!
Hi sweetie, look before I forget, did I leave my diaphram at your place? Hi mom.
No, it's not a sign! It's a very old key!
Y'know in a weird way, you have too much power. Look, you're gonna have to help me out here, 'cause I only have three.
Yeah, I think you should keep looking!
Well, uh, he's a doctor.
No, no, no, that's Dina.
I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me.
Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby?
Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn't seem so bad?
You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna go?
So Rach! You're the first guest at Hotel Monica! Umm, you'll just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning. And I thought I would bring them to you, y'know, in bed. Oh, you have been through so much.
Is this the one that I threw out last year?
Oh my God!
Hi, how are you doing Kelly?
'Dear Dr. Remore, know that I love you and would do anything to have you.' Gosh. 'Your not-so-secretive admirer, Erica Ford.' Ooh wait, 'PS enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.'
Nooo! Okay. Whoa! Okay. See I was, I was a little nervous about turning thirty. So the bus boys took me out for some drinks. I wanna puke on you later!
Umm...
Remember back in freshman year? Well, Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed.
Uh-huh.
Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say?
Oh, that's great! Congratulations!
'Cause, Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are!
Oh my God, I was thinking four.
Hi.
I didn't mean to cut it off. It was an accident.
Really?!
Oh gosh, listen if you and Chip do it tonight, promise me you'll tell me everything.
Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.
Yeah, me too!
Well, high school was not my favourite time.
What?
Oh, actually this year we just made him homemade cookies.
Uh-hmm.
All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week!
Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
Yeah.
Alright that's great, then just go. Go Knicks.
Oh my God!
Are you a virgin?
I'll do it!
So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?
He might still show up.
Why?
Okay, just get a lot better. Fast.
God, you are so strong.
Bye.
Then, I'd steer clear of Phoebe.
As much as they love you?
Oh, they-they sent me home.
Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someone's eye out!
Yeah, I mean yeah, I look great. Yeah, I feel great and yeah, my heart is not in trouble anymore! Blah, blah, blah! Y'know I still don't feel like I got him back, y'know? I just want to humiliate him. I wanna, I want him to be like naked and then I'm going to point at him and laugh!
Yeah.
Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. Just say you wanna get some fresh air.
Of course there's another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you have to prove your love!
Oh my God! You still have the Chipper!
I blame London.
And you know what? We want a rematch.
What baby?
Oh, this is so hard.
Well, we just happen to go to alot of places where you might drink. I mean, how do you go to a wine tasting without having a drink? Or... or to a club, or to the... zoo.
I don't know.
No. But I remember people telling me about it.
You can't fire me. I make your decisions and I say, "I'm not fired!" Ha!
Hi! If you're calling before Saturday, you've reached Monica and Chandler. But if you're calling after Saturday, you've reached Mr. and Mrs. Bing! Please leave a message for the Bings!
Oh, it's a great party! Great food. Y'know, most parties it's all chips and salsa, chips and salsa. So umm, what's this?
Yeah! But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife.
Hi.
No.
David who?
Hey.
Let go!
Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!
Pheebes, you know what I'm thinking?
That was that girl Megan! She booked the Swing Kings on the day of our wedding and said that I couldn't have them back unless I gave her the dress!
Oh, wait, and I got a beeper!
There is no alley behind Macy's.
What's with him?
You're Lewis Posin.
I know. It's just such reckless spending.
Nothing.
Hey!
Hey!
We're so sorry.
How about if I dance around all covered in sauce? Huh? You think it's funny now?
What else did you think about?
Hey!
Dad!
Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to.
Chandler, would you like some more orange juice?
And the way she slaps all the time!
He's totally flirting with you too.
Not that bad? Did you hear the hammer story?
Phoebe, y'know why don't we just go upstairs and have some birthday cake?
The players.
I heard that!
Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry.
He probably wants you back because you're right for the job.
Uh-hmm.
It's work.
We have a baby?
Congratulations, I think youve found the worlds thinnest argument.
Yeah, well you call her and tell her that y'know when we were kids her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadn't have stopped her, there probably wouldn't even be a wedding to go too.
I-I already told him everything! You shush!!
Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!
So uh, Joey and Chanlder, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to your place.
What do you say?
Didn't your dad used to call you Pumpkin?
Well, it's getting late.
Yeah.
Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.
And you're cute too.
Oh, that's great! I mean I'm-I'm sorry, but I'm so happy for you. And now I can work for you!
Yes.
Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana.
That's it! Dinner is over!
It sounds like it's coming from across the street.
Happy New Year.
Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?
Hello?
Oh my god.
Oh my God! Have you lost your mind?
Yeah.
Wh?! What about my allergies?!
Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier.
Oops.
Rach, wait, I can cancel...
Anything larger back there?
Nothing.
I don't know! Why don't you just explain? What do they want? Find out what they want!
For what?
Well, I'm never gonna listen to you again, that's for sure! "Y'know, harm can it do if you go and put your name down?"
All the time. In fact, I was undefeated.
He's not great umm, but he's dealing with it. Oh wait a minute, you're not gonna try...
Well I'm Monica Geller, ball like a baby.
No-no! Don't do it! Don't!
Yeah, ah, but Pheebs don't you think he's a little young to get married?
Oh my!!
Ha ha, a joke that's funny in all countries.
Oh please! Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven.
Oh hey Joey! We've been watching all day, when are you gonna be on TV?
Hi!
Then all your stuff would be here.
Hah, no no no no no no no no no no.
Oh, that's there on the bottom, see the manager, Chandler Bing.
My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'.
Oh man! I did it again!
I was.
Enough!
Now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and set up camp.
Does Ralph mumble when you're not paying attention?
What are you guys gonna do?
Okay, look, this could be a really long game.
Yeah-yeah, y'know what? Yeah, that's it-that's it, everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! That's-that's what I said! Oh come on, Chandler! I'm talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesn't match! Where is it gonna go?!
Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning to...grow a turtleneck!
You bet that I'd screw up?! So all that stuff about hiring me because I was good was...
Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.
Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else. And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my People magazine comes on Saturday, and the new Hold Everything catalog. Y'know but that does not mean that I'm empty, I care about things. I care about my friends and family. You have no right to make that kind of judgment about me.
Wow! And around the ankles, y'know that is a tough spot.
So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know they're going at it right on the bathroom floor.
Hey! Happy Anniversary!
Oh, just do it!!
Nooo!
I don't know. Rachel I'm-I'm sorry that I hurt your ankles.
Oh yeah, I totally agree.
You are so handsome! I wanna make love to you right here, right now!
Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..
Hormones.
Joey, you know you don't actually have one.
Nope.
You guys, I am not that bad!
Oh, that's great!!
No no, the father can, but um, since I am the roommate I can tell you that she's not here and I'll pass along the message, ok. So bye-bye.
No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa.... And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Y'know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.
Did you break up with her?
Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.
We're switching rooms again.
Yeah, it's great.
Come in! Come in! We're engaged!!!
What are you talking about?
Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win.
The second sister dies in Archie and Jughead Double Digest?
Wow! Look At This! I Can'T Believe I Even Fit Into This Shirt! Oh, this is yours.
The only problem!
Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats! But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend!
I got offered the head chef job at Allesandro's.
Yep, yep...You?
Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?
Oh-my-god Rachel! Rachel!
Does anybody want these?
You have scratches all over you, what happened?
This is so wild. Ya know, I gotta admit, I was kinda surprised that you agreed to go on a blind date.
Joey let me ask you a question. What does this light switch do?
Hey.
I don't know, I lost it all ok. I lost it.
No, I want everything you just said. I want a marriage.
Duh-huh!
Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds.
No you didn't.
Ok. Hey, why don't you ask Richard?
Anything but stew.
Do you always have to bring him here?
How's it going with her?
Oh come on! You're making it sound worse than it actually was.
What's goin' on?
Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you!
OK.
Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?
Hello, this is Monica... Yeah??? Oh... Okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right down. Thank you.
Wh-what are we gonna tell him?
And you're not gonna do that.
Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right?
Oh well, it's not so bad.
You gave her food poisoning!?
It's coming from the living room.
You know, the guys are probably having a great time.
What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbi, big deal. You used to dress up like a woman.
Phoebe, I did not have sex.
That is exactly why I do not lend you stuff!! Okay?! I mean, first it's my jewelry! And if it's not my jewelry, it's-it's my blue sweater! And if it's not my sweater, it's my sunglasses!
You stole them from me!
See, I've been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike some people I'm only planning on doing this once. So, uh y'know, maybe this is selfish and I'm sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be about that.
We just want you to think it through.
I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it.
Something wrong?
I just asked you.
What's the matter?
Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding.
No, just a Friday night.
Why would I have the keys?
I can't tell you. It's a secret.
Oh my God Chandler! I can't believe it!
Chandler, I'm unemployed and in dire need of a project. Ya wanna work out? I can remake you.
Listen, I'm sure that dad doesn't care. He probably thought this was funny; he'll be telling this story for years!
I don't want things to change! Do you?
Hey! Don't be a baby!
Yeah?
No way!
But you are?
What?! Excuse me!
Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing.
Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!
Uh, so anyway, we thought one of you could read something during the ceremony.
...I think he deserves a Nobel Prize.
No, you're the best.
Oh my God!
Relieved?
Joey, what are you doing?
Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!
Well y'know Joey, you're a pretty charming guy.
Oh! Do you need me to go with you?
That's okay, this is more important than fruit on my ceiling! You broke up?!
Okay.
So-so there is no party.
Licorice?
The baby shower for Phoebe!
How would I know? I-I wasn't here.
Okay, it's ready. Come on.
Oh y'know what? If you're gonna be acting like this all night, I really, I don't even want to be around you.
Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's.
Bye.
You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff!
I've been great, just great. How have you been?
So I did tell you. Okay, y'know, that really isn't the thing. Umm, the thing is that, right now I'm just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me. Y'know what I mean?
Well that's the best part. Umm, you guys get to decide!
Wait a minute! Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after she's done being pregnant. Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.
No-no-no, don't-don't do the accent. You've got to see her again.
Okay.
Ohh, wow! That's great! Oh wow! We really have to start planning! I have, I have a lot of really specific ideas! We should probably get together like four times per week. You can come over to my place; we'll get together before work! What do you say, 6:30, my place? I'm so excited!
'Scuse us
Yes, you did!
No, you cannot.
You actually broke her watch? Wow! The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel.
Joey! Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?!
You can let some of them go by!
Guys, we bought the tickets.
Come on, get into bed! I want to prove to you that I'm not sick! I wanna make you feel, as good as I feel.
Chip, is Chip Matthews.
Yeah.
See, now this is why I keep notepads everywhere.
Gin.
But why?! Did he get in touch with Emily?
Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure...
Then what is it?
Soon! I-I just couldn't before. You saw how upset Joey got! I couldn't do that to her, she's my best friend!
Hi.
Me going out with Richard's son.
Thanks.
Oh my God. You're even dumber than I am!
With a wok? I thought you were going to read my boring book to put you asleep.
That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.
What are you trying on now?
Really?!
I'm sorry.
Okay, maybe this will make your teeth look less white. Nope. Okay, colors that don't work are blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange, and purple.
Why not?
Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.
Used to work with her. Used to! I'm a relative and I didn't get invited! A blood relative! Blood!!
How many fingers am I holding up?
What!?
I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.
When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris.
What?!
Hi.
Phoebe, that stuff is...
Great! Umm, well what-what I was doing in Chandler's room is that umm, I was cleaning it! In fact, he pays me to clean it!
Do you know what's a bad idea?
It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money!
Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?
I don't know what else to say.
All right Rach, for what it's worth, I think that you're doing great. I mean y'know let's face it, no one handles this well.
That's true.
Okay, can we please go eat?
Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for it!
Soakin' up all the culture.
And?
You still want to move in together right?
Help yourself.
Rach, here's your mail.
I don't know.
I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!
Wendy, we had a deal! Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!
What are you doing with those?!
Oh, you look so great.
Well, if we owe it? Oh my... When is Joey gonna be home?
Okay.
Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?
Cut it out.
I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.
See? They're as different as night and... later that night.
Well yeah.
Oh my God, sit down! Sit down! How long as it been since we've seen each other?
Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn't?
Oh...
Score! Now can we go?
I think you're better than you think you are.
I think you look fine.
Say you're sorry.
Hmm, well you're around me all the time and you don't flirt.
Okay, but all right you're a guy, does it not freak you that you're never gonna sleep with anybody else?
She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.
Oh, how do you play the shadow game?
Well, you tell a lot of jokes!
Yes.
OK.
Okay, come on, do it one more time!
You just carry that around?
Phoebe, tell her!
I didn't take a pregnancy test.
Give it. Give it.
Okay, the owner of Allesandro's came over to yell at me, but instead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!
Now are drawers will smell nice and we didn't waste these pantyhose.
Weeeell, it's rum, and-
What if I have babies, okay? I mean I'm gonna look different. I'm okay with that, but I'm not sure that you are!
Yeah. It's Dutch.
That's a little more than I wanted to see.
I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.
Oh my God, you can't even see where the Titanic hit it.
Really?
How do I tell Chandler that it's too soon. It's gonna break his heart, he's not gonna think that I don't love him anymore.
Okay, y'know what, I'm not fine, I'm not. I mean how can I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom.... Y'know what, what if we're friends who don't see other people?
Hi, honey.
You changed?
I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man? Jam. Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot.
A new pair of shoes for the Chan-Chan man! Yes!
Yes!
Oh, oh, okay umm, so I'll see you soon.
No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs.
See? That's what I mean. I mean that, that's great! But I wouldn't trade in what I have for that. I mean I'm gonna be with Chandler for the rest of my life, and that's what makes me happy. Hey sweetie, come here! Come sit down. Hey Phoebe and I were just talking about how our relationship is deep and meaningful. It really is don't you think?
...Yeah. Yeah, I do.
Ross, you've got to do something about the humping.
Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit. Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!
Wait, now, what am I doing again?
Okay, guys! The candy is coming; I just need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool!
I am the best.
Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things.
Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?
How's the big anniversary dinner?
You're-you're-you're gonna bring the Barca Lounger over here?
That's it big girl! Come on!
You didn't know that already?
Nooo! Never! I mean, we're living in the moment. God, it is so nice for once to not have to get all hung up on 'Where is this going?'
Very good.
Well, I did one time, and-and I want to start doing it more. See that's what this is about.
Are you alright?
Okay. Don't you want a cookie?
What?
Betrothed...
You know, it still smells like monkey in there.
There's a game?
Ah-ah-ah, now you started this, you will finish it.
Hi.
See? This is exactly why I'm making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.
I know.
No-wait-no-no!!!!!!!
Uh, huh. Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away.
That's right, she came back all by herself.
Joey that is horriable.
I just told Rachel that Roy touched my boob.
Me neither.
It's goin' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers.
Oh, So you can move them!
So the going for help went well?
Hey Phoebe! Guess what?
I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?
We're not really gonna buy these people steak dinners are we?
Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you!
Yeah! And I got it on sale, too.
Y'know if it's any consolation, he really did sound like he was having more fun with you.
Umm, can we see you ride it?
It's for their own good.
Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you cool with that?
Just be yourself. But, not too much.
Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, "Do you see a future?" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her? Oh my God! You did it already! You married her, didn't you?!
I cannot believe you broke up with her just like that.
Does it involve travel?
Ross, I thought you were over this.
Yeah, y'know, but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken. And, you wouldn't have to worry about the salmonella. But of course with salmon you'd have to worry about the chickenella... So, I can't wait to see this place you're getting married!
Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.
No you're not.
Like?
Hey!
So? How did it go with Joshua last night?
Ohh, how is he?
Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey. Have you seen it?
No!
Oh, honey, the earrings...
That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!
I'm telling-If you put that in her apartment you'll never hear the end of it.
I gotta go to work. Has anybody seen my left boob?
No forget it, I'm not gonna tell you now.
On three, 1...2...3! Now my pillow's all wet!
Hello? It's Joey. I'm so glad you called! Chandler told me what happened. Y'know he's really upset about it.
Well, what's the part?
Oh, sweetie!
Give them to me.
Because I need the money, and I thought that it'd be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect.
We're not gonna have sex! Okay, nothing's changed here. He still doesn't want children and I still do, so that's why we're just gonna be friends.
As a joke, this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000 tip. His number is on the check, he just did so I'd call him.
I'm really not deciding!
C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life.
Because I don't have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. I mean there's no way.
Hey.
About a half an hour.
What?
Nooo!
Okay. Umm...
Two? TWO? How is that possible? I mean, have you seen you?
Y'know which one was she again?
Joey, we had a deal. That-that's why you're here! I've got to fire you!
you don't have insurance?
Hey, where is everybody?
You look cute in bubbles.
Really? Cause I'd need like $500 for all the food and the supplies and stuff.
It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.
Okay!
And Joey.
Leon, Leon. Shhh! Guys. Wait, I don't understand. Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor. That was not a kick back. I'll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing. What corporate policy? No. Yeah. All right. I just got fired.
"Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!"
W-wait. What is that?
Thank you.
Well no wait a minute that's not true! No, what did, that was really sweet. And it kinda works out for the best.
What?
I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one!
I'm fine-d. I'm fine-d! Y'know, it's a really hard word to say.
What?!
He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.
Six? I just had it for one night. It's three.
What did I tell you about the hall?!
No, Phoebe, I'll tell you what, if you get ready now I'll let you play it at the wedding.
A hat! Yes! We need a hat.
I am, aren't I?
Sure.
You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
Stop it!
She's right there.
Damnit Ross, get your butt out of the bathroom.
Ya know, I was thinking. Ya know how we always stay at your apartment? Well, I thought maybe tonight we'd stay at my place.
Really.
No, we're not! We're not leaving!
That is never good.
Aww, thank you.
I'll get it! Happy Thanksgiving!
Ross, we haven't done the routine since middle school.
Oh it's not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines as, say, oh I don't know, having a third nipple.
We were shopping, and we had lunch.
And his puppet too.
Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert?
Hey!
Look. Joey, do you know we can see you from here?
Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.
I know. I need more pie.
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...
Oh that's okay. Don't worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back.
Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.
This wasn't addressed to Days of Our Lives, this is, this came to your apartment. There's no stamp on it, this woman was in our building.
I made you a surprise.
Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?
This is it. Yeah, this is the one. I can't believe I found it!
Oh no!
What are peanut butter fingers?!
Oh well, where is he?!
The Bible?!
Michael.
I have not been sick in over three years!
Thank you.
Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay?
When it's your assistant, I would say never.
Oh that's too bad. It's true, but too bad.
Very good, so good.
It's enough for wedding scenario eight.
It's like two miles!
Okay.
Well, doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something stupid, like Ross.
Feeling a little better sweetie?
I am not.
So umm, when I was in the shower I was thinking about our first night in London...
I know, I just thought it would be fun.
All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.
About what?
Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?
No, that is what the game is.
Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him.
Yeah, but y'know we could sneak in and watch.
'I am Bea.'
Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this.
Please, have some!
You're meeting Richard?
Phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia.
Behind my brother's back? ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.
Did not.
And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? And the chairs can face this way , and... You go.
Do you?
No.
Hey!
I feel terrible, I really do.
No. Not after what happened with Steve.
Rach, come see who's out here!
Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel, but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.
What are you doing?
Mmmm! It's good!
Hi Chandler.
Wh-what, why?
Oowww!!
Okay, all right, I think you're great, I think you're sweet, and you're smart, and I love you. But you will always be the guy who peed on me.
Ohh, of course we are! We left it up to fate. If we were supposed to get married there would be a clear-cut sign.
Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.
He would just roll me over and I would stop snoring.
You remember that video I found of mom and dad?
Now, open your eyes.
Yeah, that's a big step.
Um-hmm.
Really? Who's number two?
Sure.
Then all your stuff would be here.
I can't believe mom and dad are selling the house!
Uh, good.
Oh. Well then way to go you big movie star!
What?! I-I-I don't, I don't do that!
Why don't you just get a roommate?
Are these the shoes?
Uh, hello.
Wait a minute, are you doing Joey's "Audition didn't go so well. Yeah it did?"
Actually, I did!
So, should I call him back?
Toothpick?
I don't think mine likes me either.
Dr. Greene. Oh my God it's Rachel's dad. What're you doing here?
You just asked me.
Well, no. You're Chandler. Y'know, Chandler!
Hello? Oh, hi Wendy! Yeah, eight o'clock. What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... OK, great. All right, I'll see you then. Bye.
Are you sure you're okay?
Ohh, here you are. Y'know, I'm-I'm glad you decided to hear me out.
You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone.
That's what we used to call your ah, your motorcycle in high school. Y'know how a motorcycle is a Chopper, and you're Chip. Nevermind.
Wouldn't you be?
Do you want to go out on a date with her?
Oh boy me too!
Yeah, what, do you think we're stupid?
Yeah right.
What?!
Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?
Yeah?
Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings.
Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one?
What are you smiling at?
Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!
You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!
Oh my God, you're a freak.
Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron.
Oh, stop beating yourself up! People make mistakes! These things happen! There aren't any message you've forgotten to give me are there? Apparently you're not very good at it! I...
'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun.
Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course. OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce... ... with just a touch of mints... and... ... ginger.
Oh wait! You didn't just sit on my Kit-Kats did you?!!
Hello, Chandler.
Hi. Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'm taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were.
That's not true, you don't have a moustache.
Ohh!
Okay.
Okay, Phoebe you know what you're doing right?
Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this, so that you can bunny bump against my back.
Oh, you got the whole night, huh?
Then why did you move?!
I can't believe he did this.
Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.
Hey!!
Okay, count to three. 1. 2. 3!
What is it?! What about Pete?
No.
Okay! Why?!
No honey, I'm sorry, but the weekend's not over yet.
Janice?!
Look!
Wait a minute, y'know, you're bringing me!
I know honey, I'm sorry.
Chandler, you're not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe it's time that you let that stuff go. If your father's not at your wedding...you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life.
We're with you. We got it.
This is all of your things.
I'm gonna miss you so much.
Yeah.
Is it the same thing that Chandler had?
Oh God.
Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker?
Phoebe! Come on! Let's go! Come on! Why aren't you dressed yet?!
I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.
I said that you had a nice butt, it's just not a great butt.
Why not?!
Give me that!
Ross, there he is.
Merry Christmas!!
Oh my God! Ohh! Look at this one! It's so beautiful!
Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn't cry. She wasn't angry or sad.
We'll talk later.
It-it's so great to see you both here.
So, how about you huh? How do you know the happy couple?
Please!!
Oh. Thank you. Ohhh, thank you very much. Oh, thank you for coming. Uh, just a second!
You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.
So, are you sorry that I told them?
I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!
Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!
Woah, woah, woah, let's go back to 29.
Nah, I got it.
I'm outa here.
Hey. It's three in the morning. They don't know that I've come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.
Oh, Larry.
I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.
You flicked me first.
Worked like a charm.
Ohh... Oh, that's okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef. Like I have nothing better to do! So what's up?
Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!
Sure, I love this part!
Hey, I've come to terms with it, you have to too.
Joey.
Okay, I got it. Phoebe? All right, you pull. I'm gonna spread the legs as wide as I can. Joey? Now is not the time!
That does not mean you know us better, I-I want a rematch.
Oh, I'm sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.
Hey-hey.
Are you okay?
Hey Pheebs!
Okay.
Well, she was shocked when I told her, but then again so were most people.
All right relax Mr. I've Had Sex Four Times!
Come on!
Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him.
You're gonna what?
What kind of changes?
Ready? Wrestle!
Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it'snot really true, is it?
Did not.
Yes, they can stay with us.
Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?
My turn? What-what are you talking about?
Oh yes! I have it right here, on ice!
Bye!
Really?
I guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present!
Thank God! I can't watch him anymore!
What don't you just calm down Phoebe! All right?! Why don't you just get all your facts before you run around telling everybody that you're the only hot couple!!
Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just......throw your purses at it.
Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he's-he's called me up and asked me out. And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat.
I'll call you back.
All right, Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things. Now Phoebe, go tell the guys they have to help out!
The oven is on.
Two.
Chandler, this actually bothers you?
I promise you, he would definitely want you back.
Give me that.
Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight's specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag-Why is nobody writing these down?
Break!
Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh? Do you have a dressing room? Do you have a chair with your name on it?
Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all.
Hey.
Why, it's dinner for six. 5 steaks, and an eggplant for Phoebe.
Dad, dad this is a good thing for me. Ya know, and you even said yourself, you've never seen Richard happier.
What?!
I warned you...
Oh, you're right.
Yes, is that okay?
Oh yeah.
What uh-What did you-What?!
Okay, I'll go!
Uh, Ross.
What?
If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time. That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that's your department now.
Hey umm, what's this?
Well, y'know it's none of my business, but aren't you married?
You know Paul?
He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was every allowed to hear, "The Sound."
And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.
I can't believe we've never done this before! It's sooo good! So good for Monica!
What a minute, what did he say?
Was it really that good?
Of course.
Rachel?!
I'm sorry, I don't understand what you just said.
Honey, there's a reason.
Oh-ho-ho, sweetie, sweetie, you gotta stop saying that, now. It's no big deal, it's not even worth mentioning, you see we all do it all the time. See watch this, Ben, Ben, Ben. Ow, Monica bang! Everybody bang. Ben bang. Rachel bang. Bang, Rachel bang! Oh, isn't that fun?
Rachel! I'm never gonna think it's okay for you to cheat on your husband!
Oh, y'know..
Yes, I'm sure! Rachel is there something that you want to talk me about?
Ohh, absolutely.
He- he pooped in my shoe.
It's almost 8 o'clock, it's almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he?
So your first whole weekend without Ben, what're you guys gonna do?
You know what, everything's gonna be okay.
No! Y'know, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land, fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together.
Weren't you nine?!
What?
Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?
Oh, he's sober alright. Just turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason.
That's the surprise!
I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?
Oh, good. Thanks.
Hey. Whaddya doing?
You wanted it to be a surprise.
Yeah I can! And don't think I don't, because I do! I mean all the time, you betcha!
Chinadolor Bong, come on, we steal that TV Guide every week!
Listen, we don't have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.
I want a baby.
Yeah, me too.
Ugh! Well, y'know, we were away...
Stop with the broom, we're not making noise.
Bodington's!
Oh honey, we're close now but you-you wouldn't believe the years of-of nugies, and wedgies, and flying wedgies, and atomic wedgies, and.... That's where the waistband actually goes over your head.
Thank you.
Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-that's it, that's it, all right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They're not the right size, they're not Victorian, and they just don't go.
Ross? Let's go.
Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- -I'd want yours.
Shut up.
I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn't that give me the right to control him-help him?
All right! Come on Monica! Look alive! Come on, look alive!
What's that supposed to mean?
'A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green'.
Who the hell are you?!
Well, you're making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.
Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me.
Because then I don't have to!
All right, hand me that other box of photos; that's the very last one.
Chandler, you're not gonna die alone.
No, a guy would be saying, "I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else." Oh my God! I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else! I've been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that I'd be giving up! I mean, I...I'm never gonna have a first kiss again.
Really Phoebs? Because, you know, you'd have to be an actual waitress. This can't be like your 'I can be a bear cub' thing.
Oh, dad, turn it off.
Stop!
That's okay.
No. No, thank you!
Yes, I did! And you are welcome!
Okay, look at this one. This is my favourite.
We're going to Las Vegas to see your dad. It's time you two talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law.
Pheebs, you've been up for 24 hours! Go to sleep, honey. Th-this isn't healthy.
Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch!
Is that all?
Y'know, I think if I were going to be with a woman. It'd, it'd be with someone like Michelle, she was so oh, she was so petite.
That's what you say about porn.
What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund don't you?
Hey!
Okay, what's going on with you?
Ross, the heat!
Oh, no...
The park huh? A public place.
It's okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it.
You'd better hope I don't see you in the hallway!!
Right.
Why?
I'm engaged!!!!!! I'm engaged!!!!
Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can't eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.
Where you can make out with your assistant.
That's not a question.
Hand me those tomatoes, I'm gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.
Nooooo. You're really not going?
Okay fine, now Ross...
Okay, please be good, please. Just remember how much you all like me.
Why?
You're not gonna believe this. Okay, so I go over...
Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?
I don't have an atlas.
Y'know what, I like Kathy.
Hey Phoebe, will you give me a hand?
They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?
Who? Is that your sister?
Sorry we're late.
You're so efficient. I love you!
What's tonight?
Now come on. Well, I'm glad we worked things out.
Yeah. Where were you?
Hey Maureen! Gosh! Hey uh, Chandler? This is my cousin Maureen.
Yeah. You!
It's kind of an important one!
It's good to see you
Here you go. You can wear this.
I'm gonna go put my make up on, we have to be at the hotel in an hour!
Yeah, I've just been fiddling around in here making delicious treats for everyone.
What?
Hey.
What is it?!
She lets you borrow them.
Forty-two to twenty-one! Like the turkey, Ross is done!
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
Oh that's so sweet.
I'll take it down to 95% but that's the best I can do.
What are you talking about? She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!
No!
Hi.
Really? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned. It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it.
Oh, an old glove?
Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.
Mine? Right here?
Nighty-nite.
Hey, guys.
How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and I'll make you a nice martini.
Well, thanks, we like him.
One two three.
Wait a minute, I can get ice at the restaurant...
What if I turn out the lights?
Isn't it.
Oh my God!
That counts!
I'm just saying, if we put just a little bit of makeup on you.
Hey, I went up.
I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! Hi, Tim.
Wow! Wow! And it's definitely all gone? There's nothing there to work with? What were you thinking?
Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet!
Does anybody wanna split this with me?
Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?
Y'know, it is so strange seeing Ross here this time of day, 'cause usually he's got the children's hospital.
Ross will do it.
Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh?
So what are you gonna be?
So you're free Thursday, then.
A mirror?
Well actually, Ross doesn't.
Mmm.
Oh. I guess you can. Okay but; I-I have to return it, so you can't like it.
Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?
Well, an-anyway, I just-that night meant a lot to me, I guess I'm just trying to say thanks.
Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So...
Ross married Rachel in Vegas! And got divorced! Again!!!!
How-how did that happen?
Why don't you just go out with her!
I...
What's hard to believe?
Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?
No, it's more like a good luck.
Yes, you are so smart!
Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby!
Hey there.
Well so?
Oh-ho-ho, we've got company.
Or 45.
What were you doing in Africa?
Chandler there's nothing wrong with crying! I mean you don't have to be so macho all the time.
It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.
Oh, I like Elizabeth.
That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready.
Actually, I did!
It's Monica, open up!
Ohh.
Where do you want to start?
Hey! It's me. Mon-i-ca! Can I just tell you how proud I am of you.
I'm talking about me having a baby.
Y'know dad, Chandler is one of Ross's very best friends!
So-so you would've just lied?
You be okay?
Am not!
I'm sorry, okay? It just-tonight was supposed to be y'know, it was supposed to be a big deal.
Just uh, do the right thing.
All right, check me out.
Ohh. And I don't even have a date.
Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.
Dr. Burke? I don't think so. I mean, like, he's a grown up.
I'm quitting!! Woo-hoo! I'm okay!! I'm all right!!
NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?
Alright, you wanna feel better?
No, if he doesn't like our cookies, too bad, I am not gonna be blackmailed. Look if worse comes to worse, it gets a little warm, we'll call it a theme party.
Joey just hired Chandler to be his assistant!
And yet, here we are doing it again.
You wanted it to be a surprise.
Who cares? He works in a museum!
Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass.
All right, biggest suite in the place. Come on!
Really?
How who wears it?
I gotta tell ya, I think it's okay to be that guy.
Yeah, he's just gotta get a shot.
There it is. Joey, what are you doing?
What?!
I'm sorry..
You wanna finish this right now? All right, we get a deck of cards, high card wins. What do you say?
Yo- hooo!
Okay, stop it Phoebe, you're getting me all tingly.
If you're not going then I don't want to go either.
Wow, this is so weird. I just realized this might be the last time we'll all be hanging out together.
Oh God.
Well good, here let me help you out.
Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? Y'know, just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats?
I need a few more things to make the margaritas. Uhh, I need some salt, some margarita mix, and tequila.
Bobby and I are going away for the weekend, remember?
No you don't.
When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?
Doesn't it ever just freak you out that-that you're never gonna be with anybody new again?
I'll pick it up for you!
Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park.
I can't believe you're getting married!
Chandler.
Whatever you decide, whatever you do.
Of course!
Yeah.
Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out!
Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now?
All right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and we're down by two points. Two points.... Phoebe you do a button-hook again. Rachel, you go long.
So look umm, while we're st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right?
Is that some kind of boat talk?
Of course I have! What do you think, I'm some 30 year old virgin?
It's okay. It's okay. Just pretend that it didn't happen! Okay? No one needs to know! I mean, Phoebe's not an official ballplayer! I mean, only official ballplayers can drop the ball!
Hi.
I'm so happy for you!
Ohh.
Okay, umm, okay, umm... It's just Joey and Ross.
Hey, great skirt! Birthday present?
No.
Gin.
Hey!
That's okay.
Do you remember that jacket that you love so much, that you thought was too expensive?
Has somebody been drinking my fat?
Two it is. Ok, time for bed, I'm gonna go brush my teeth.
Because she's not gonna get to keep the babies.
Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza!
And that's why, I'm not inviting you in for a drink. Bye.
All right, I'll do it just this once! But you can't tell anybody!
We are not going to whistle.
Hey, don't mix those up, you could really ruin that lollipop.
Great. It's gym class all over again.
Oh! So you think I'm a failure!
No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change. Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?
I don't know.
That you're a liar.
I don't remember. Do you wanna take a walk?
See, didn't I tell you?! You're getting over Ross already!
Hi. Do you know what time it is?
Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends? Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?
How'd the lecture go?
Y'know what really bothers me? Is-it's how-how different you act around them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the "I'll see you around, Bing!" "Not if I see you first, Doug!" I gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up.
Okay. Oh! A coloring book!
Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic , in Central Park!
Phoebe, you were supposed to take that back!
It's unbelievable! I-I can't believe that sign didn't work!
Yeah. And y'know, if you wanna cry, that's okay too.
Phoebe, what's the matter?
Rach! It's me! Pick up!
What?
Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy. I mean, y'know what, when he left I actually used the phrase, 'Hummina-hummina-hummina.'
Hey!
Okay, I feel like I'm talking to Lassie. All right, Phoebe would you just tell me!
My God, you can't even look at me! Can you?
Come on Chandler, come on, I can handle Ross. Hold on! Hey Ross. What's up bro?
You-you're gonna have to put your foot down?
Yeah hey, a weird thing happened today whey I was at brunch. This woman overheard that I was marrying you and-and then she...she wished me good luck.
What?
Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. Think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! Plus we get to have our own, ani-Vegas-ary! A-Nevadaversary!
How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room.
I won't give you anything, but you'll owe me 2.95.
There you go, enjoy your coffee.
How about we play for more money, say 150?
You and me both.
Plus, everyone's gonna see your thing.
It's nice to meet you. Janine...?
Dad, Chandler was just laughing at your joke.
Why?!
Really?! How much?!
Well for your information he happens to be one of the brightest, most sophisticated, sexiest men I've ever been with.
I know!
Nothing, I don't know.
You owe me 20 bucks.
I do.
He's... our age.
I can't do it!
Oh.
Ugh, y'know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.
Hmm?
Phoebe, he's gotta be in the room for that to work.
Well uh, I'm trying to make something for Joey. Do you mind if I raid your fridge?
Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him?
Hey, you guys!
Phoebe and Gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner.
Okay.
Oh, that's what I would do, forget mine.
I wanted it for years! I was gonna make cookies for my children.
Ok.
Alright, before I tell you, uh, why don't you tell me how many women you've been with.
Okay. Umm, Phoebe, you suck too.
Great.
Oh... Uh...
Yes? ..yes, she is.
Yeah, but I don't think we have time.
Well, it just seems like a really small number.
Stop it, stop it, stop it!
Relax. Y'know, she may not even know.
Ooh, umm, oh Kathy! Kathy, I love you! Oh!
Hey!
Chandler!
Oh! Him.
Do not start without me. Do not start without me.
What's this?
Okay listen, y'know when you move in Rachel's room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?
Hey!
Look, all we're trying to say is, don't let what happened with Carol ruin what you got with Emily.
Well, who's voice was that?
I promise you, next time I will absolutely tell you.
Who is this?
Alright, go on.
'Scuse me?
And then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't.
Really?
Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!
Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a really stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows who she might end up hurting.
A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here. From now on, it is gonna be my way, or the highway! All right? Does anybody have a problem with that?!! Hey new guy! I said, does anybody have a problem with that?!
Ahh! Aren't you dressed yet?
Oh come on, it's only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is that enough lire?
I'm not talking to her!
Yes, I want to change. And why-why don't you go down and get us a table?
dammit!
Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. You're right, I'm sorry.
Umm, when I said that uh, that Chandler and I wanted to umm, live together we meant alone together.
No I didn't. I asked, "got the ke-eys?"
Ahhh, hey honey? Don't you have to be at your interview now?
Well, you know.
Don't worry. You'll find some place to get married.
Oh.
I mean really, think about it.
Ohh, fun!
Maye it's me.
One-Mississippi. Two-Mississippi. Three-Mississippi.
Now?
Hello, people who do not live here.
You wanna be in charge of the food committee?
Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, , Ok, that is either, "How could you?" or, "Enormous breasts!" Here he comes!
You look great too.
Ooh, Phoebe, you look great!
Ok, how about pilgrim Mockolate mousse?
When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out.
Them?! Who's them?
Y'know what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go to have champagne at The Plaza.
Happy birthday!!!
Well thank God you were here! I mean, we have to erase that!
What?!
Phoebe, your face is fine! Come on, none of this stuff is going to happen to you! Stop being such a baby!
Jody!
All right ah, Ross, this is the extent of my knowledge on the subject. Call Rachel.
And Dad, y'know that mailman that you got fired? He didn't steal your Playboys! Ross did!
Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on.
Well, I-I-there was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute umm, but I don't anymore.
Yeah, that'd be great! Thank you!
All right.
Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour?
And some of us really have to pee.
No. I hate this part.
Okay.
Okay, Ben, I won't tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you don't tell about our little bonking incident.
What?
Well you let me know if you can, because y'know I can bake a pie to cover it.
All right, listen up. There is usually only one dress in each size so when they open those doors, fan out. Now, this is what you're looking for! Memorize it! When you locate the dress, blow on these. All right? Three short blasts, when you hear it. Come running.
Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?
Whoa! Are you okay?
Okay, we're gonna need a distraction.
Light still out?
And for our two-week anniversary, he's gonna take me to his cousin's cabin for the weekend.
Oh no, two days, you must be bummed.
Oh wow! Okay. Don't scare me like that okay? I mean for a minute there I was like, "Oh my God! The worst has happened!"
When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.
No, that's not mine.
We haven't eaten yet!
It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!
Hmm, bite me.
See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! And here is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs. Did you hear that Chandler? No such thing!
Well, are you just hanging out with Ross?
So wait, Ross's stuff is fine, but I have no memories because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!!
What is it?
Hey Joey! Aww, you remembered even though you're a big star!
No.
How can you not remember? You made us call you...Bea.
Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?
So, you wore your nightie to dinner?
I think that is so great! When are you gonna ask her?
OK, um. Goodbye.
Well, what about his family?
Hey, it's good to see you!
Alright, alright, alright...
Hi Ben!
Oh. Big family dinner tonight?
I mean they're trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I've been waiting for my whole life.
All right, it'll be great! You just make her think you wanna have sex with her! It'll totally freak her out!
All right Rachel, you sweep behind, I'll pitch it to you, you throw it down field to Phoebe. All right. Break.
Hey, cheer up! You're gonna see her again, right?
You guys! Do you realize that any minute now, Phoebe can be pregnant?
So, did I hear Poconos?
No! You don't know the system! There'll be nobody messing with the system!
You say 'Thank you very much,' and then you buy me something pretty. Come on, we're gonna put are hands in this bowl, and we're gonna start squishing the tomatoes.
Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?
Maybe I do! I'm pretty feisty!
I don't know sweetie.
What d'you think?
I-I-I think you look great.
You did a minute ago!
You were invited?!
Did you like her? And I'm just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this.
I mean I-I don't I think I have enough quarters.
Yes! You are so smart! I love you.
Looks like he's playin' baseball.
God! If you're gonna cry about it!
The head tilt?
Yeah.
So, are you ready to go?
What?
Fifteen minutes.
That was a half an hour?
This doesn't mean anything, does it?
It's okay. I don't care. It's uh, it's fine.
Yeah!
Oh my God.
No way!
Got the keys? or Got the keys!
Aww, honey I'm sorry.
That's a great idea! I was saving them for something special.
Wasn't there a little song?
You just put an empty carton back in the fridge!
Sit down! We're winning!
Oh that's so great!
What are you doing?
Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!
Do you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you wanna see me cry?
Really? I only had two glasses.
You are going to make a joke about my special present! Why would you do that?!
This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?
Okay.
Oh.
Okay.
Can we just start throwing things in?
Uh-huh.
We said six!
A little tight? I could see double-oh and seven in those pants.
Here you go.
Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming. What?
You're welcome.
Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are we celebrating?
Okay.
What was it for?
Thank you. This is my friend Phoebe. She's gonna be helping me tonight.
Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?
Let's take a walk. Y'know maybe you should consider writing for Talking Out of Your Ass magazine!
Yeah, she's here. Hold on a second.
Maybe, do you need a tissue?
Alright, but I'm very excited about this OK, so you gotta promise you won't get all big-brothery and judgmental.
Frannie was the one who found your Playboys and showed them to mom.
I won't care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here.
Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.
You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it's offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldn't be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! Now let it go! The joke sucks!
Wouldn't you love to do it just once?!
Ross , foot on the floor or come over no more!
Hi!
Yeah you're right. I don't know what I was thinking.
Oh, great!
Where?
Oh my God! It's like one mind.
Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies!
You've got to get back out there, it's your party.
Maybe I can try at intermission? Phoebe, come on... you know what? Let's just go!
Joey, you don't have too!
You had a salad.
But still, it's a big change. The end of an era, you might say!
Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember.
You don't want to know what tonight was.
Right. Umm, listen since we're-we-re on that subject, umm, I just wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross's mother...
Well, I'm gonna fill in for him as food critic for the Chelsea Reporter.
Yes, you did!
Oh, that's okay, I can't wait to see everything again! All of the memories...
The woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation and that we could move up our wedding and Chandler heard! I know! How bad is this?!
A couple of days.
I know. Thanks.
Thanks.
Okay.
All right, come here!
I so wanna be attracted to you.
Hey! Okay, so I thought we'd start with my make up and then do my hair.
Is he doing his shark attack bit yet?
Well, why don't we just bunny up.
Ross, I hated you when we were kids.
Are you through with that?
I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.
What? I'm just said.
Okay, just wait, please. I promise we'll come up with something. Just give us a little more time.
Wait. Rachel, no, he's married. Married! If you don't realise that, I can't help you.
That is so funny. Let me see that.
Yeah, apparently, they're pretty good seats.
Y'know, I try to stay positive. . .
I just... can't do it.
All right, sweetie that's fine. You didn't do it on purpose.
I'll take care of it.
Oh my God. Richard? Hi!
Did you also have his album, It's Not Easy Being Green?
Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun! Ohhh!
I can't do it. I'm sorry, I wish I could, but umm, see you have these feelings for me....
No.
Oh, yeah.
Ya know what, I think I'm gonna go to my room and read Cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there. Know what, at least maybe I can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Cristmas candles.
Sure.
Oh, I love my life, I love my life!
Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.
Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.
Y'know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex.
And this goes for all guys?
We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled 'CUT!'
Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.
You bet your ass I'm gonna fire you! Get out of my kitchen! Get out!! All right! Anybody else got a problem? How 'bout you Chuckles? You think this is funny now?
Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it won't be so bad.
Yes you are! That's the only way to explain all this stuff!
Hello.
Joey, did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in?
Are you serious?
Rachel locked the door.
Chandler?
Just...please tell him.
Would you look at them?
There's more beer, right?
Joey!
Oh my-Oh good God!
Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this! Um, have a seat. First of all, we haven't been introduced, I'm Monica Geller.
What?
All right, Phoebe get open. Rachel, go long.
No.
Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
What about your breath?!
Shut up!
You dated her!
Nobody move! Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way!
No he's not!
Oh God!
Rach, you're gonna come though aren't you?
Joey, why don't you put them in the lost and found?
They've arrested Monica.
That's not possible!
Chandler!!
Well, you used to like playing the guitar.
But what?
What are you talking about?
I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.
Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.
Why don't you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn't have to apologize.
Hey.
You have dinosaur checks?
No! But, I'm throwing this shirt away! I think there was a little misunderstanding before.
So! So we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong!
Hexadrin.
Really?!
Bye.
Hi Mr....Bing.
Oh, Phoebe, she couldn't stop crying! With those thick glasses, her tears looked giant.
Well, you're not working either.
Okay, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I-I-I was um, I was taking a nap.
Anybody lose this?
Emily's straight.
Chandler!
Why not?
The babies are asleep, I'm sure you'll be okay on your own for a while!
Oh that's sweet. Don't touch me.
You are just the sweetest.
Yeah. I bet you can't guess what color my tonsils are? I'll bet the apartment!
Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant. And then you realised if you bitched about it, then you would stop cooking, and you would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.
Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!
Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself.
I didn't change!
Are you saying I smell bad?
That was you?!
The big hat, the pearls, the little pick handbag.
Okay.
Yeah, definitely!
We're gonna pick up the wedding dress then we're gonna have lunch with mom.
I don't know.
All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?
What was the dream about?
No, I will not cave.
Jellyfish sting! Oh, it hurts! It hurts!! It hurts!!
I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise.
Because Purvry Perverson over here can't stop staring at her.
Hello, Joey.
Keep talking.
Thunder being stolen!!
Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica! Oooh, I can't leave her!
That doesn't seem fair.
Where's Benny? There he is! Where's Benny, there he is.
And! We also have speaker phone.
Right, you only go for them 5 minutes before they get married.
I am so glad you said cooks.
All right then. Bye.
NOOOO!!!!!!!!
I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?...Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!
Uh-huh.
Regular or decaf?
That's true.
Hi.
Oh, um, I don't know if that's a good idea.
Okay, fine but please don't be upset! Okay? I was really depressed okay? And really drunk! I just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just wanted...just sex. So, when I...went to your room that night...I was actually looking...for Joey.
Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!
Hello? Oh, hi Ross! See? Other people call me!
When did I sign for it?
Stick out your tongue.
All right. Honey, that's-that's a sleeve. Okay?
No drops!
That's not gonna work.
Ross you know that tonight is your date with Hillary?
Well, what am I going to say?
Oh God, I'm so sorry.
You could do that!
That's right baby! Okay, what do I want now?
Really?
Why is Ross naked?
All of us.
Yes that would be lovely.
Yeah well, I ran into Richard.
Oh, I've got it! I have got it! Pictures from your childhood. This will get you going good!
Oh God! I gotta go!
You al-you already had it?
Oh, I ordered mine first.
Ya know, you had no right to go out with him.
I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you.
What, he doesn't like Josh?
Okay!
Oh, please, stop! Look, we're supposed to be honest with each other. I-I just wish you could tell me-just say, "I don't like your massages."
Oh, I love museums!
No sweetie, you've got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! You've got to kiss some serious robot ass!
Ohh, Please?! I'm a single mom, with a thirty year old son!!
You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!
Chandler, please, come on. Look at him.
You are insane! You-you gotta give this up!
Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here's the thing, for the last two weeks I have umm, tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere...
What?!
I bet this will work!
Go on, teach me something about men and women.
Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can.
I think she's here.
Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos.
Wait a minute. I thought last night was great.
Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?
That's your call.
That really means a lot. Oh, and Mom, don't bite your nails.
