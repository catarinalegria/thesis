Great!
I'm going to find out if he really thinks supermodels are too skinny. Hey, Pheebs!
Why? Honey, what is the big deal?
Oh that's right! I'm sorry! I-I am early! Finish! Please!!
Okay, uh...
D'oh!! I've got it!
No. I have got to get ready and go to a dinner at my bosses house. It's a very big deal, there's a lot of people there I have to meet.
Ooh, I just wish we hadn't lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...
Alright, just put your hands out and I'll back up into them.
Me neither.
Hey! Hey!
Why, why not?
Okay, here we go. I'm Jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird look on your face. What? Honey, what is it? Did I get it wrong? Did I get the hair wrong? What? Did you just picture it differently? What? What?
What?
Well neither do I!
Oh, I would love to!
No! Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn't mean I wanna walk around naked. I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.
Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.
Oh yeah.
Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Okaaay. Any of you guys want anything else?
Okay.
Oh-oh, Pottery Barn! You can throw the rest away.
Chandler, relax, Chandler, she'll be here.
Ohh, thank you for my beautiul earrings, they're perfect. I love you.
Pam! Oh God okay, just imagine this, "The Pam."
I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against that thing!
Ross! Janice?!
I don't know, it was you and a bunch of albino kids.
No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?
well, now, wait a second, who did I just put as my "In case of emergency" person?
I've never lived like this before.
Oh.
Excuse me? Can I help you with anything?
Oh, great.
Oh wow!
Wh-whoa! All right, okay-okay, I see, I see what's going on here! Now listen, look-look, I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression, but I am not some hussy who will just sleep around to get ahead! Now even though I , hey-hey-hey, even though I kissed you, that does not give you the right to demand sex from me. I do not want, this job that bad. Good day, sir.
Hi, guys!
I love him. He's so pretty I wanna cry! I don't know what to do. Tell me what to do.
What?
What is this? Ross, what is this?
During a blackout? He'd get trampled!
Y'know, bonus night. Y'know, when two people break up but they get back together for just one night.
Well of those things that you said in the interview, I mean if you believe any of them, I must not be a very good assistant. Y'know what? I am just gonna pack up my desk, and I will be gone by the end of the day! Well, I guess there's no use to me sticking around 'til the end of the day!
Nooo! Hello? Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much. Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really.
I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh, this is our cart.
Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn't a chair.
It's a truffle. It's got all of these layers. First there's a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch, then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sauteed with peas and onions, then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!
Yeah but, maybe it's not what we think. Maybe it's tell Monica I'm sorry I...drank the last of the milk.
What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?
Julie.
Oh, that's um, interesting.
Ooh great! Very Monica.
Yes! I will! Absolutely! Hello, Rachel. Hi, Joshua. I left my wallet here on purpose. Really? Yes, I just wanted to see you again. Oh, I'm glad. Rachel, I'd like to say something to you. Yes? How you doin'?
Thanks!
Well, y'know, the reason I didn't wanna go running with you is because um, well y'know the way that you run is a little...
Ohhh!!!
Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't wanna...
Just once!
Don't just say yes! This isn't a game, Joey you can really get hurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!
You never come into this office again!
Joey, come on! We just went over this!
I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too late.
So, I love you.
Phoebe...
Yeah. Umm, unless you wanna come inside?
Amazingly, that makes sense.
Y'know what? No. It's not over until someone says, "I do."
Okay.
Well, there you go!
Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and everything is changing.
Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Y'know, it's-it's just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don't get to keep the gifts.
Oh my God.
Anyway, um, I guess this belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me.
Ok, we can do this now, can't we Ben? Yes we can, yes we can. There. I did it. I did it. Look at that, oh, stays on and everything. Hi.
He carries a briefcase.
Joey, what are you talking about? You're a terrific actor.
Yeah, it is! But you're just a kid! I mean you're 25!
Oh wait, Ross, would you just stay and help me get dressed?
What's Flimby's?
So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt!
No, I know! I get it! It's funny!
Ohh! This is so exciting! Oh God... Come and knock on my door...
No.
This place is amazing.
Oh.
Ooh, so cute, that I'm thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.
Here it is! I love it. I wear it all the time.
Oh dear God.
Oh my God, its happening. It's already started. I'm Kip.
Hey!
Well, my eye is a little itchy.
Ok, thanks Pheebs Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!
Oh, that's sweet.
Hey.
It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.
Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.
Uh-huh, yeah I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with you.
Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh!
Yes.
I will wake you up in a way that's proved very popular in the past.
Monica.
Hey!
Hi.
Really? You think so?
But you said that you liked him! I mean what happened?! Did ya just change your mind?!
Yeah, I'm good.
Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.
Or. We could put a hat on his head.
Come on, Terry, I'll even clean the cappuccino machine.
"Pheebs, can't make it, got a date. Talk to you later. Big Daddy." Big Daddy?
Well do you get to look through one of those like, those periscope thingys.
Okay! Here we go! Okay! Hi, Joey! It's Rachel! Umm, I am free tomorrow night. Yeah, sure, sure I can bring some sandwiches.
Joey!
Gimme the keys!
Yes, okay, oh, by the way, I just gotta say, I think it's really nice of you that even after you've moved, you still keep storing that stuff for Joey!
Ross!
Yeah?
: Sak's... Fifth... Avenue.
Oh my God!!
Fine.
I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!
Hello? Oh, Pheebs! It's Phoebe!
Okay, umm, I'm gonna get my sweater.
Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.
No.
But I...
You went out with a guy in the Navy?
Wow.
Oh, I don't know. I guess we have to eat.
Wow, y'know if Joey and Chandler walked in right now, we could make a fortune!
What are you shushing?
Ohhh.
What are you guys doing here?
Y'know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding, it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.
Really?!
Oh my God, Phoebe, Pottery Barn has ripped off the design of our antique!
What?
Okay, I'm not just waitressing. I'm.. I, um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies.
Okay.
Hi.
I am? Oh, look at that, yes I am. Enough about me, enough about me, Mr. Back from the Orient. Come on. I wanna hear everything! Everything.
I love it at Joey's!
Ooh, Pheebs, what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are?
Both of them are here, both of them, both of them are here?
Oh no-no-no! No, I got this all under control.
Hi!
But! Don't you have to give him his money back?
Well it's not, honey I'm sorry, I guess I'm just nervous. I mean, it's you, ya know, it's us. I mean, we're crossing that line, sort of a big thing.
Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.
