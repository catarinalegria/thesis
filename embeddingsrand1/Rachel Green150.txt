Okay, y'know what? We don't need her measurements.
What's the matter?
Oh, thank you that's very helpful, I'm glad you came over.
Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff.
So why don't you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?
Oh.
I'm sorry, let her?
I get to hire my own assistant!
What?
How have you never been on Oprah?
I've got magic beans. Never-never mind.
Say it!
Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm gonna go use Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom.
No.
Oh God, even his knock is boring.
All right!! Fine! Fine.
Oh my God.
Hi!
Well Phoebe, we gotta do something! Well, y'know. I mean there's no way Joey's gonna make it in time. So I'm gonna through the hotel and see if there's any other weddings going on.
Oh, thank God.
Yeah, come here!
Oh, God, ask them what they want.
Wow! I mean I had no idea that that was gonna...
These are, these aren't for you. These are for you. Welcome to our country.
Pheebs, Monica tripped me, I don't think I can ever run again, ever!
Monica! Come on!
Hey Phoebs, whatcha got there?
What's that?
Yeah!
What'cha gonna' do?
Oh not-not so much. Umm, what-what do you, what do you mean is there something wrong with Ross?
No! Forget it! I am not gonna ask Frank to give you one of his kids!!
Y'know, I don't-I don't know. Let me, let me check.
Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this?
Yeah?
OK, listen, I'm sorry about last night and I really want to make it up to you.
Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Because-I'm sorry, all right. Because y'know what? She didn't want me-not important. The point is, I was right. Your decision. Okay? I was right. Your decision.
Okay. Okay, great! Umm, okay, just turn around.
Oh that's what you want.
Alimony.
Ohh...
Phoebe, are you okay?
Ohh, I'm gonna have to get over it. God, see I didn't know that's I had to do, I just have to get over it.
All right, we've got to tell her he's gone.
Maybe that's all we do, what about Julie?
Hi!
Oh!
I don't know, I, I feel like I had a dream about you last night but I, I don't remember.
Well, thank you, Melanie.
But I told you, I didn't have the time!
Uh, well, I think, I think he broke up with me.
No, it's been three nights in a row.
Macadamia nut?
Ugh, you will not believe what that sleaze-ball from Ralph Lauren did too me!
That is the Coast Guard.
Well, I like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress.
Yes I do, it's just that Ross is. . .
Oh my God, he dream-cheated on you!
And Chandler, you're gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know Raquel can't be late.
Well of those things that you said in the interview, I mean if you believe any of them, I must not be a very good assistant. Y'know what? I am just gonna pack up my desk, and I will be gone by the end of the day! Well, I guess there's no use to me sticking around 'til the end of the day!
Ok, here, I know what we can do.
I am not a baby! You know what? I swear to god, just because you get so uptight every time we...
No, really. Really, Pheebs, you're not gonna be the one worrying about saving for college, or yelling at them when they're bad, y'know, or deciding to put them on Ritalin when they just won't calm down. Y'know?
My God!
Aghh.
Ugh! Joey, I have to go.
Mindy.
Okay. Umm, what should we do for the theme?
Yeah, he broke those too.
Cupid.
Does it?
Right?
Oh no.
Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place.
Oh my God! You look so beautiful!
What?! Are you crazy?
Okay.
Yeah?
So, whaddya think George is like?
Oh no, you're the best.
Oh hi, Mr. Wineburg, hi Mrs. Wineburg.
So Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am still your wife!! What, were you just never gonna tell me?!! What the hell is wrong with you?!!!! Ugh, I could just kill you!!!!
Okay, fine. Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why I'm a terrible waitress? Because, I don't care. I don't care. I don't care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don't care where the tray spot is, I just don't care, this is not what I want to do. So I don't think I should do it anymore. I'm gonna give you my weeks notice.
Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?
Joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? It's not your fault.
And you know Monica and Ross!
Hi!
I am so sick of guys. I don't want to look at another guy, I don't want to think about another guy, I don't even want to be near another guy.
No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?
Hey!
You think I trust you with it?! No! We're gonna split it! You take half and I take half!
Well, because she loves you and because you love her.
What, no, no, no, mine are deceptively small I mean, I-I-I actually sometimes, st-stuff my bra.
I don't think so.
When I was um, 7, I crashed my bike right out in front of his house and to stop me from crying he kissed me right here.
Do you even know who Kip is?
The beef? Yeah, that was weird to me, too. But then, y'know, I thought "well, there's mincemeat pie," I mean that's an English dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, y'know. Oh! by the way, can I borrow some Rum from your place?
C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat.
Water it is.
Ok, he's goin' to get my coat. He's goin' to get my coat. Oh my god, you guys. I can't believe this. This is unbelievable. What's that?
I don't have any issues with my Father.
Oh God, oh, and then she told the funniest story...
Ohh that'd be great!
Uh-huh.
Oh! Well, um.. You've got plugs!
Ross!
Okay.
And Joey....
Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone.
Oh? Yeah! Sure!
OK.
Oh good.
Huh, yeah I guess we are roommates now.
Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.
Yeah.
What? What's what you were afraid of?
I have absolutely no idea.
And your lap does not count! Okay? Come on help me move this.
No! No! No! I'm not yelling at you, I'm just yelling near you. Oh God Joey, ohh I'm my father. Oh my God, this is horrible! I've been trying so hard not to be my mother I did not see this comin'. Oh, Joey, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I just wanted you to learn.
Oh yeah, I know, but the garbage was full.
Ohhh... I'm fine.
Im okay! Im okay! Mr. Heckles, Mr. Heckles could you help me please?
No. I have got to get ready and go to a dinner at my bosses house. It's a very big deal, there's a lot of people there I have to meet.
Honey, we have to go. Our reservations are at 8:00.
Okay.
Let's do it! Ross?
Oh it's umm, it's tofu cake. Do you want some?
Because!
You mean, you mean 30 days?
Let me get my coat.
C'mon, I'm not saying it was a bad movie, I'm just saying, you know, it was a little. . . hard to follow.
There was a woman at the... The stripper?!
Oh, God, he's such a pig,
Uh-huh!
Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.
That's easy for you to say, you weren't almost just killed.
Hi! You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you.
Op, but the twelfth brings a lover's spat.
Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to this?
Ohhh, OK.
I don't know. Y'know, they didn't get us anything.
I'm so glad, I'm so glad you shared. And I'm glad that you're done. What do you say we umm...
Pancho Vila?
OK, OK. So, you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?
Ohh, well I'm not totally back yet, but thank you.
Pheebs?
What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.
No, there's nothing to make up, she's gonna know that I have a key to her office, I've got to get you locked up back the way you were!
Uh well, uh this is a silent auction. They lay out all the stuff here and then you write down your offer and then the highest bid gets it.
