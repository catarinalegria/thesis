Hey. That uh, that my sweatshirt?
Oh my God, you're back!
No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool.
Because she uh, she-she thinks that you are blah and that you, Monica, are too loud.
It's okay, these things happen.
Yeah, I know exactly what she's goin' through.
Ugh. Now if a cow should die of natural causes, I can have one of those right?

I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands...
Hey guys! What 'cha been doin'?
Yeah!
You spit on me man!
I can't find the remote. Thank you.
What if I smack my head on the concrete?
Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something might've happened to a huge chunk of it.
Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...
Everyday use.
Hey, you guys!
All right that's it, school is in session!
