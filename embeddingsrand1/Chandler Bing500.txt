The doctor.
Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.
Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.
Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats.
Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?
What, you never look down in the shower? Oh please. I'm not allowed to make one joke in the monkey-is-penis genre?
I don't wanna know what Monica got me. Y'know? I mean, look, I'm sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not what Christmas is about.
Hey Phoebs, can I have the milk after you?
All right.
You can't leave! I have your shoe!
No, Eddie likes to keep it over there.
Y'know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs...
I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!
Yes!
All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?
Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?
No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.
Okay, bye! Oh my God!!
Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend.
No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish.
Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing. Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'! Don't worry, those are the right letters.
C'mon, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy, Huh? Huh? Huh?
Yes that was mine.
Well, you...don't look good Joe.
That's what Monica said.
Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, I'm-I'm talking to ah, . This is the part where you say your name.
How about Joey... Pepponi?
What???
Well, why don't you tell her to stop being silly!
Oh yes, sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro? Please let them win!
Airplane! Airport! Airport '75! Airport '77! Airport '79!
I didn't know it was a big secret.
Oh thanks.
Well, this is just as boring in England.
Okay, good luck with that.
Screw the Knicks!
How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago?
You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?
Huh.
Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn.
What is the matter with you?
And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight.
And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor. And might I say your breasts are still showing.
Well, you do want all that stuff, right?
Joey!
What?! Ow!
That's okay Pheebs, we're not having a party or anything, so you don't have to get us...
Oh yeah, I should probably call them.
Forget it! Okay, I'm not giving up the apartment.
Next time?
Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.
I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr. Peanut than Mr. Salty.
Yeah, o-okay.
Thanks man.
Okay, but this is the last time. With a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there. Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick--chickeeeen.
It could've been worse, he could've shot her.
Yes, how 'bout a verse of Killing Me Softly. You're gonna sneeze on my fish, aren't you?
Ahh-hahaha!
Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!
Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...
That's very funny. We done now?
Yeah. Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.
It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.
Stick to your side!
Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia.
Phoebe Buffay In Buffay The Vampire Layer.
Hey, I'm going for sushi does anybody want.. Whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp.
Really stupid.
Really?
Hey! Well, I've been preparing for that my entire life! Or something about you that's mean!
Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this.
How long you been waitin' to say that?
Yeah, I'll go get one.
Sorry. I'm sorry. Y'know what, we're just gonna throw it.
Ho! Ho! Ho!
I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay.
What a geek!
No!
Are you funny?
Chandler.
Well, you know Phoebs. I don't know if it's your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day.
Where ya going?
Yes he did.
Stay out of my freezer!
Well if people don't know they shouldn't just guess!
All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!! Pipe-pipe-pipe down! What is the matter with you people?! This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you, and I'll bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right?
Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y'know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!
What did you just do?
Ahh, you know what? That is....Who wouldn't want you?
No. No! No! No!
Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor.
Yes.
How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?
Hey!
What?!
Okay, keep saying it!
Yes...Yes..Uh-huh, You? We did you.
Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.
Well, I am drinking lots of cups of coffee because I'm exhausted! Because Joey started snoring!
Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.
Well I, I think we'd remember something like that.
Are you actually saying these words?
Um, is it sugarless?
Hey!
Uh-oh.
Okay.
Congratulations.
That's a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.
I am pretending.
Oh, uh, yeah... I just knew that sometimes when you're writing, you... you don't always know the exact time.
I will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now. How can you eat the cheesecake without me?!
Ahhh.
Dude, you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up.
You done?
Bye.
It is so good to see you!
Joey was in a porno movie.
Kinda. They're really big.
Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?
Well, 'cause she came back the third summer and she'd gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow...
Look, it's my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you.
Okay, a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I can't get in!
You're naked in this picture!
Bye. Are you still out there?
All right, you will notice that I am fully dressed. I, in turn, have noticed that you are not. So in the words of A. A. Milne, "Get out of my chair, dillhole!"
Four different women! I've had sex way more times!
Uh-huh.
Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.
Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, it's the only chance to see New York.
Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman! What's this?
Y'know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.
Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.
Hey!
Yes!!!
Bye.
Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if you're not careful you may not get married at all this year!
Why not?
I confronted her, and she didn't deny it! I don't live here!
Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's fast!
What are you talking about?
Okay, here's the thing. We're gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that you're drunk.
Joey told me, he saw you two kissing.
No. No. We're not gonna do that, y'know why? Because its not an even trade.
Guess who's back in show business.
Ah, sure, Nina. Whats up?
You told him to play the boxer gay!!
Listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. I'm buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night.
We're going to Everest! Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass print on Everest!
Seven times!
Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about.
No-no-no-no, the game's not over, we're just switching teams.
Uhl..ell. By the way, in case you missed that, that sound was, "Uhl, ell."
No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we're up at the altar and I'm like this.
Oh yeah! Yeah! Don't worry about me, I'll be fine!
"Benefits lapsed."
Yes, and we're very excited about it.
And I'll be using his dead body as a shield.
Did you see Betty?
Yep!
All right, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna get shot down. Any advice?
No, our guy is just a floating head.
Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.
Hey!
What?
Yes?
Look, I'm just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.
It is?
A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.
Hey Joe!
Okay.
: I thought we had them!
Does it matter?!
OK Phoebs, how many do you want?
Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!
Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.
No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who's going like this...
But we don't know the neighbors.
Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat. . . all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem.
What was tonight?
How are you feeling?
I also said, "Yes!"
When I was growing up I...played the one on the far left.
You have to really wanna see it.
Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let's take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs don't mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that's just an ordinary pig not even a pig that's good at sports!
So, how many have you sold so far?
Hey.
Wh-wh-why?!
Uhh, no-no thanks.
Hey, mister tux!
We can't do that that's insane. I mean 'A' he could wake up and 'B' y'know, let's go for it.
All finished!
You-you do?
Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.
Not yet.
Hey! Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!!
So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down.
Tonight? You-you didn't say it was going to be at nighttime.
I did, but...
Knit, good woman, knit, knit!
Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with one too.
I'm not arguing with that.
No, actually Laurie's a boy.
More so than anything else.
We've got to do something!
Volleyball.
Oh yeah, I just showed this a picture of you and guys were throwing themselves at me! They're buying me drinks! They're giving me stuff! Knicks tonight?
What?
Yes?
Okay.
What're you kidding? I broke up with her. She actually thought that Sean Penn was the capital of Cambodia.
7:15. Watch doesn't work.
How do you know so much about this?
Oh, are we playing this?!
Guys are signing over their 401-K's to me?
Excellent! Y'know Ross met somebody too!
When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.
It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.
I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I doing Ebony and Ivory.
She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.
All right, that's it, give me your underwear.
Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.
Yes.
So this is nice! I wish I didn't have to go, believe me! But unfortunately I have to. Oh uh, by the way, what's the name the girl you're dating?
So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!
Is it on?
Aww, thanks man.
Yeah?
Well, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still be living with him.
Yeah!
Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?
Well where... Where did she go?
They do?
Hey!
Like, when you're cooking a steak.
So I got ya something.
Yeah, I remember.
Well, your gonna need much bigger jars.
What?
This is not going to work.
What's it about?
Well, I... I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know.
Weirder than watching his two moms make out?
It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it!
No.
Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday.
Yeah, for about 30 minutes.
No, you sh-No you said you made that up!!
Okay, well he totally screwed up the punch line. Y'know, it's supposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh.
You're right, and I'm sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I won't say another word tonight.
Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really happened' thing?
Uh, the book?
Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?
Not once!
So, let's go.
You ready?
Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?
Hey.
What are you doing here?
So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law & Order?
What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie.
Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here.
Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting.
Okay.
Much sense?!
Because, I-I should've called! Y'know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would've gone out with Nick, and they would've ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!
I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.
Uhh, that was Joey. He's running a little late, he says he's sorry.
Course there, they just call it food.
I don't know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.
All right buddy, time to roll over. No-no! No, no-n-n-n-no!! You are going to a clinic! You're going to a clinic, and a pyjama store!
Oh, that's Ross's.
Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you.
I-kea! This is comfortable.
Emotional Knapsack?
Isn't she cute? No!
Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?
Really?!
I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic...
We have to leave for New York in an hour.
Authorization? I don't need that. I'm gonna put everything back.
Yes, but I feel like I've really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think we're two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.
Ok, think, what would Jack and Chrissy do?
Hey listen, we've gotta go, I promised Richard we'd meet him downstairs.
Okay. Thanks.
Well, don't, don't think me immodest, but, me?
Well, you still havent taken down the Christmas lights.
So uh, which one is mine?
Well it couldn't have been worse. A woman literally passed through me. OK, so what is it, am I hideously unattractive?
Okay we have to do something about your breath.
Oh no, no, no, no.
I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?
Uh, if you say so sir.
Well, I've got a girl in here.
Check out the ring.
It's an old key!
Had it.
I majored in lightning rounds. All right, we're gonna destroy you.
All right, Ross, I just have to do one thing, really quickly, it's not a big deal. GET UP!!
Hey, sweetums.
How is that worse?!
Hey.
Op, op, I'm convinced!
Well you know, we got to talking and uh, he said he needed a place and I had a spare room.
Oh yeah!
Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...
Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?
What happened?
Okay, so, I'm in Las Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli-
Aahhuuhhh....
Me? No. You?
Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?
Could you want her more?
Hey.
Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?
Because sometimes, Phoebe after you sleep with someone, you have to kill the fish.
So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?
Yep, I'm in a tree.
Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!
No, not us... Us!
If this is the way all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a problem.
I broke up with her.
Phoebe, are you having a heart attack?!
No we didn't!
Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.
Yes, please don't spoil all this fun.
We should always always break up together.
Rach, Rach, we gotta settle.
Okay.
You have no trouble telling time now right?
Huh.
What's the matter honey?
That, that's what's stupid.
Oh-ho-ho-ho.
No I-I-I'm fine.
I think you played the Gunther card too soon.
I'll see you guys later, I gotta go...do a thing.
Seven times!
Yes, but I-I uh, don't have too.
Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I'll be sure to give him your shoe.
Wait, wait! Wh-what are you doing here?
Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...
Oh nothing, we're just talking. Y'know, blah-blah-blah.
Yeah.
...Dinah?
No-no
Sure...
No! Shhh!
Yeah-yeah, me neither.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called "Invisible things for Kathy." Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?
You can be the best man when I get married.
When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!
Monica's wasted.
Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!
So, what are you gonna do?
You see what I mean.
Yeah baby!
That's correct.
Oh yea yea, absolutely.
Okay.
Oh, no no no, she took off with my clothes.
And that doesn't scare you?
Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?
Are you serious?
Our baby.
That's just a lot of big talk, y'know.
That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her.
Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people. Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?
The nerve huh?
All right.
Y'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number.
Oh no.
No. When it comes to sweets, he's surprisingly strict.
Oh, come on, there's a rest stop right up there! Come on, I really have to goooooooooo.
Yes! See you and I have always been like-
Yeah! No! No! No! Don't fall asleep! Okay, I am going to make you some coffee. And I probably won't spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor.
That's right my friend. It's time for...
I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.
Not once did we do that.
Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
Uh-huh.
Say 200?
No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate, Momma's Little Bakery. I feel terrible, I'm a horrible, horrible, horrible person.
Okay, okay, here she comes! How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesn't want to get married?
Oh, it's not important? It's not important?! If it wasn't for a bride's maid you'd be marrying him not me!
Helen drinks. Will you marry me?
I paid for those tickets!
What?
We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.
Oh my God.
What a great apology! And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!
You know, I mean, you can't tell your parents you were fired because they'd be disappointed.
Wow! Listen, we had a good run. What was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then!
Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!
And you're okay with that?
Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?
I do?
What?!
Hey!
Well, not at first.
Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this.
What'd you rent?
Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh, great book and you are the queen of everything.
Well he doesn't have to know! It's not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.
Is that a real thing?
All right, call it in the air.
Forget it! Okay, I'm not giving up my bachelor pad for some basketball seats!
Nothing!
So what do you say, maybe sometime I hold your gun?
Okay. "So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"
Okay. Oh yes.
Oh my God!
All right.
Hey!
I can't believe you came back.
Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there.
No I'm serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you.
Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we can't leave in the small apartment after we've lived here! Didn't you ever read Flowers for Algernon?
I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother. I've done it again.
Oh yeah, that's very nice. Plus, y'know they were free and they're too small.
I just came over to drop off...nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?
So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know.
There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!
Men are here.
Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word, "Yippee!" just ignore me.
All right, bye-bye now!
You remember Janice.
Monica and I almost got married last night.
Yeah.
Hi.
Dude that is so sad.
Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!
Ross, don't. Ross!
Oh, will you give me the thing.
Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.
Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.
I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.
Okay.
Whoa-wh-wh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
Joey...
Yeah me too.
Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.
Do you want us to leave the room, or?
What happened?!!
Hey, it's me.
Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!
At this?!
Well, I then guess I'm going to Yemen! I'm going to Yemen! When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?
Okay.
Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, I'll be your boyfriend.
You had to ask.
Stop talkin' to your men.
What?
Not bad.
Dude! That's my girlfriend!
You know when guys hang out they don't just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?
What's going on?
I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.
I've found.
Wait a minute, wait. You're telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn't want you back?!
Okay.
Okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!
What?!
You don't think I've tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria.
Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not.
Yes!
Hey.
What are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes?
To her face? Look it's the end of the date, I'm standing there, I know all she's waiting for is for me to say 'I'll call her' and it's just y'know, comes out. I can't help it, it's a compulsion.
Diet soda.
Thank you, buddy.
I'm a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.
Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.
Hey, will you grab me a cruller? Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!
And the moment of joy is upon us.
Yes! Yes! I'm good! Are you good? Are you good? Is everything-are you-are you perrr-perfect?!
Umm, yeah.
Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
Yeah.
Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please.
Yeah, I guess.
Sure.
It's the theme from Good Will Humping.
Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever...
Joey, it's been three days, okay.. Your just a little homesick, Okay. Would you just try to relax. Just, just try to enjoy yourself.
You said...
Well, Kathy's last boyfriend was Joey.
Okay and he hasn't proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.
Uh, Dana Keystone from college.
Yeah, it's two guys in a ring, and the rules are "There are no rules."
I happen to know a Fun Bob.
Yeah?
You're kidding, no!
Well that's not an, even a real fish. No, that's a goldfish cracker.
What are you doing?
You can't just call Monica's room.
Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo.
Y'know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because, that's you and I together! Merge!
So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?
Petrie, right, right. Okay, some people gonna be working this weekend.
Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!
