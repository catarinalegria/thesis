Hey, y'know what? Why don't we think about changes we can make in the living room?
What's wrong? What's wrong? You're married that's what's wrong.
The only way that I said six would be if the seven's, let meet at seven, not at six.
Uhh, 9.
Screw the Knicks!
Why?! What happened?!
No, you didn't get me!! It's an electric drill, you get me, you kill me!!
I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.
Why her mom?
No, you sh-No you said you made that up!!
Well, you're not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?
Hi! I'm back. Yeah, that sounds great. Okay. Well, we'll do it then. Okay, bye-bye.
And I don't wanna say this, I don't you guys to hate me, but uh, I don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go. Oh my god!!
We already knew that!
Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?
Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.
Ah, finally an explanation.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why don't you put down your copy of 'The Rules' huh mantrap?!
What?! Ow!
Where did you, when did you, how did you... How did you get a girl like that?
Maybe it was his sister's. You know, maybe it was his daughter's.
Stop it. Stop it!
Alright, I'll tell you what, you call the couch and then, and then we'll call the couch, and we'll see who it comes to.
That's what I did when I lost my Clydesdales.
Why would the baby creep me out?
No.
Uh-huh
Yes, we do. But, we have to change first.
Oh, so you're going with the teacher, huh?
I think they get it.
I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you lived with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to bed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!
And say nothing?
Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?
Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.
Hey! You okay?
Hey.
Our kids are gonna be fat aren't they.
Can I be that guy?
Okay, I'm going to go stand over there.
I think it's the dying cat parade.
No.
That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.
Hey Monica, here's your broom back.
Richard! No one supposed to know about us! See I, did it again.
I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish...
Well what's the difference? Your eggs aren't here anymore, are they? You took your eggs and you left. You really expect me to never find new eggs?
I'm here to see Mary-Angela.
No I-I-I'm fine.
Question. If I don't care about my watch, can I use it as a weapon?
What's going on?
Ooh, you almost had it.
I'm sorry. If you ask me, I'd move in with him.
That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?
What, what, what?!
Okay. Listen-listen, we're not gonna have to walk this way the entire time are we?
Monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing! Okay? It's crazy. {Finally! The voice of reason.} I mean, just impress Gary and Phoebe we have to go upstairs and have sex over and over and I'm saying no to this, why? Get your coat.
So, uh, how often can you do it?
I don't think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in. Draw!!
Yeah, well, you're wrong! Okay, you're wrong.
Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?
Well this one's for you.
Why?
May I help you?
Well yeah, but then...
Bye.
Okay, it's um...
Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?
I always thought having a heart attack was nature's way of telling you to die! But you're not gonna die. I mean, you are going to die, but you're not gonna die today. I wish I was dead.
No we didn't!
I KNEW IT!!!!
And your friend Phoebe?
No. When it comes to sweets, he's surprisingly strict.
Sure, I'll do it with ya.
Dog grooming huh? Okay, just don't make my tail too poofy.
Oh, God.
This isn't your first surprise party, is it sir?
Depends on what you mean by we.
You look good.
Why two?
You-you-you don't wanna give into the fear.
Well, it's sharp, it's metal, I think I can do some, you know, serious damage with it.
Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.
Well hello!
Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!
There you are.
Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.
Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no waiting.
Ah, well, maybe thats, ah, because youre getting a big raise.
Hang on buddy!
Oh yeah, I should probably call them.
Oh, that's Ross's.
Okay. But if you don't come back soon, there's pretty much nothing I can do about it!
Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?
Hey!
Okay, so you both just know this stuff?
All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him!
If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard.
Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight.
I'll make something up! I'm good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman!
All right.
Oh. Oh right! Right! Because you're still seeing him and uh, he's a good guy. I mean, I remember a time when...
Thank you, Mister Drunken Gambler! Okay, you get this and uh, we get the biggest suite in the place! Wait-wait-wait-wait! We get the biggest suite in the place.
If this is the way all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a problem.
What are you doing out there?
A pen.
Janice?
Hey.
So uhh, how's the palace?
Yes, it is, at Office Max.
Oh! Oh! That's so hard.
Who's that?
99...100! Ready or not, here I come! All right, let's go over the concept one more time.
I'm not in a meeting. I'm right... Whoops.
Ahhh.
Yeah, but uh, it was 1982 and my flock of seagulls haircut was tickling her chin.
Oh no-no-no!
And he's not speaking metaphorically.
Yeah.
Next time?
So, how many have you sold so far?
It still wouldn't be clean. All I want is my freedom.
Okay, it's just weird! Okay? I don't want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I need...I don't know what I need. I need a walk.
Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!
No you don't-get it in black, not brown.
Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.
Rent?
Oh that's so funny because we found someone too.
Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it.
One more game?
So um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?
You understood that?
Where I don't want to have a relationship ever! I just want to have sex with strippers and my friends!!
Do we dare?
Treeger's snaking the shower drain.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! And you are about to marry a wonderful man! Hey! I'm marrying a dead woman!
Isn't that Ross's money?
Yeah well, I hear the place looks great.
So, you feel like goin' for a run?
Oh my God!
That's what Monica said.
Uh, uh.
Ahh, come on! Y'know what-y'know what, I think I'm just gonna go home and call Kathy.
Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh...
So you risked your life, for a sandwich!
Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy.
Yes.
If I was a superhero who could fly and be invisible, that would be the best.
Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away.
Done.
You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting.
You said no right?!
All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her, it's over.
Ross!
Wh-what?
Ok, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky.
Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.
You still can't stand her can you?
That's what they'll call us.
Okay and he hasn't proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.
Yeah, it's a very large plane.
...betrothed couple.
No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.
Oh.
You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great! Ahhh!
What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?
Oh my God!
Well, we used there's up last night making scary faces.
Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it! {Whoa! Where have I heard that before? Matthew Perry talking about signs in Las Vegas. I guess it must've been some movie I saw.} What do you say?
Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?
No, Amish boy.
Glass, sand, whatever.
Hey. Do you want this scone? It came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you!
What?
Why?
Look, when I've been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly, and I'm sorry.
It is going to be perfect. I am taking her to her favorite restaurant. I'm going to get her a bottle of the champagne that she really loves; therefore knows how expensive it is. Then when the glasses are full, instead of proposing a toast I'm just gonna propose.
Clunkers?! Oh my god!
I'll get you the Cliff Notes.
No, I don't want to tell anybody else because I don't want Monica to find out.
Chandler.
Ross, ten o'clock.
Okay.
We're worried about you.
And then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked. And then, and then you click it again and she's dressed. She's a business woman, she's walking down the street, she's window shopping, and whoa-whoa-whoa, sh-she's naked!
You be cool.
Oh, okay!
Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and don't talk to anyone.
Oh, I see. I thought you just really, really liked your new couch.
Yeah.
Hey Eddie. Daahh!! What're you doin' here?
Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there?
We're notwe're not saying anything.
What's this?
You are so great! I love you!
What?!
Hey!
Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! I'll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!
Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this.
All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!
Okay, ah umm, ah, a 8. Ah, a 6?
Too many jokes... must mock Joey!
Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft.
Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?
Well, Kathy's last boyfriend was Joey.
Oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom.
Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?
What's it about?
Oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! No-no, vomit tux!
He's the headliner of a gay burlesque show.
Look out kids, he's coming!
Oh yes.
Oh sweet Moses.
I can see why that's hard to resist.
Yes! Well that-yes.
Noho. Who doesn't they like me?
All right!!
What did you just do?
Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!
Well it's just while Monica and I were dancing to them it was...the first time I knew that...you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.
OK, I don't, I don't mind the last pound. OK, in fact I kind of like the last pound. OK, so don't make me do anything that I'll regret.
Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?
Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!
You just thought of that in there?
Well, I just thought it'd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.
Hey-hey are you drunk?
Hey-hey-hey Rachel, funny thing. Actually, the ah, end zone starts at that pole, so you're five feet short, so we win!
Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.
Yeah, right, yeah, I guess so.
Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him.
Hey-hey!
So there is no good time to ask that question.
Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
Me! On my computer.
What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!
What's going on?
Uh-huh.
I'll take one. Sometimes I like to hold stuff like this and pretend I'm a giant.
It's a nickname, I'll explain later.
All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.
How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?
Well, you're not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes...
No-o-o! No? No-o-o! Look Joey, here's the thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, I'm gonna be moving out man.
Oh, how well you know me...
Cupping.
Oh my God, how did you do that?
Dying people say the craziest things.
What are you doing?
I figured I'd buy those. Pat, I'd like to buy a vow.
Okay.
Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?
Be right there sweetums. A totally different situation.
Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!
Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard you'd be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!
Y'know what would work?
All right, we haven't had sex yet. Okay, what's the big deal? Y'know? This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to the next level.
Now imagine you live at the supermarket.
Because I'm very happy for him! And you, you lucky dog!
Okay, you get her in here. You bolt the door. I'll be in the closet.
Okay.
Uh Kathy, with K or a C?
I don't know.
No. No. I don't think so.
Ooh, yum!
Hey, man. What's up?
Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon...
What is the matter with you?
Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate.
Ahh, Hotties of the Paleontology Department, there's a big selling calendar, eh?
I can't smell your sandwich?
It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor.
Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.
Oh well, that's uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!
Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped.
What?
I just wanted to show Monica your book.
That's very funny. We done now?
She said yes!! She said yes!! Awful play, man. Whoah. Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way. Oh, listen, the usher gave me this to give to you.
A face ass?
Why would our guy be a weirdo?
Is that a swing?
Where are they? Where are they?
Yeah, check out the ring.
Nobody is opening anything ok? Look, I don't know about you guys, but I wanna see the look on Monica's face when I give her my present, and I'm sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just, can we put them back?
Oh God.
I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OH...MY...GOD.
I've found.
It's the theme from Good Will Humping.
"Big guy?"
Well, I'm guessing he wants to do a little dance. . . ya know, make a little love. . . well pretty much get down tonight.
Ahhhh-I'm not going to call you.
Ahhhh!
What are you guys doing together?
Thank you Rachel.
Welcome home man.
Oh, are we playing this?!
Here it is! Here it is!
I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer.
It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very were gonna be having all the sex.
Guess who's back in show business.
I'll take it! All right look, I gotta know. Are you finished with me? Are you finished with him? Do you still love him? Do you still love me? All right look, I'm gonna need an actual answer here okay, so which is it, him or me?
Well, you want me to uh, clench anything, or-... Susie? Susie.
I can see it now, "Look dad, it's the Sphinx!"
Are you serious?
The guy was hammered, okay? There's no way, you look like Ross's mother.
Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians.
Wouldn't that be Frank the III?
Oh yeah, I just showed this a picture of you and guys were throwing themselves at me! They're buying me drinks! They're giving me stuff! Knicks tonight?
Yeah, he's made phone calls, written letters, he even came to New York, but I always said I was too busy to see him. Y'know it's all very Cats in the Cradle-I don't want to get into it. Here we go.
Okay, is this lamp in the same place?
Ohh. Mmm.
Hey, what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be at work?
So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.
You have to pick your moments.
So, when I woke up this morning, he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes.
Now I've upset you? What did I say?
Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card people.
Hey, look at all the boxes!
Hey!
I'm going to the bathroom now.
Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut...
Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles.
Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?
Oh yeah, it's so cool. Now I gotta go, Officer Bing has gotta, 10-100. That's pee-pee.
You can be the best man when I get married.
Ohhh.
Sure...
Oh totally! Pull my finger.
Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I'll be sure to give him your shoe.
I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!! You are surprisingly strong!
Really?!
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called "Invisible things for Kathy." Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?
Eh. I thought that was an alp.
Dude that is so sad.
Hey-hey, hey! I don't know why I did that!
Oh yes!
No, I'm not!
Do you want us to leave the room, or?
He's right. Nobody's gonna benefit, and you're just gonna hurt her.
Oh, that's Ross's.
Yeah.
He's Greek Orthodox.
Well, only if you order stuff.
Look, I'm sorry. Okay? I'm weak, and pathetic, and sorry.
No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.
Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!
Joey!
Let me try it on!
All right!
Y'know what? There's some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?
You're kidding right?
Now, there is a dress laid out on your bed. Okay, you're doing great. You're doing great. You're doing fine.
Hey Joe.
Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went.
Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. Chan and Jan Forever.
Oh man!!
I can't believe the guys missed this.
You built a fort didn't ya?
Oh yeah? Joshua, give me a call sometime, guys like you never go out of style-what did you throw away?
What?!
Oh no! No! No! No!
It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!
Bladder Control Problem Stop Wife Beating Hemorrhoids? Winner of 3 Tony Awards...
Where is she, Where is she? Oh, hey, I have a question, where is she?
Yes, yes eight.
Sounds like a fun party.
A place where no one will ever get out alive?
Hey! I'm sorry! That- where are you going?
Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!
Me too.
Oh-ho, it'll be back. Oh-ho, there's nobody in the room.
Too bad, she's leaving.
Well... we-we do. You can only eat Tic Tacks in even numbers.
Not 700 exactly?
Is this a service you're providing me?
Phoebe, are you having a heart attack?!
Congratulations.
Our guy smells incredible.
For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.
So you really OK about all this?
Woah, woah, I've put on a little weight?
Oh yeah! With who?
See? Here we go.
Really?
Yes!!
Oh, that's The Wedding March. Does, does that freak you out?
Sorry!
Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go.
One. . . two. . . two and a half. OK, just show me one of them.
Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place.
Y'know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because, that's you and I together! Merge!
You hear that? We're the guys.
It was terrible. I fought with my colleagues y'know, the entire time. Are you kidding with this?
Y'know it's funny I started it but, now it's scary me. So could you come out here please?
Ni-hi-ice!
So, what do you think?
Okay, give me a second! Did you clean up in here?
You mean like, music?
Okay.
Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.
Hey!
Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.
No!
Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!
Next time you snore, I'm rolling ya over!
I just saw Janice.
Yes.
Well, I feel like a snack!
Is that supposed to be funny! I was really worried over here!
Well, I then guess I'm going to Yemen! I'm going to Yemen! When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?
Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
Okay, it's not a check. They're saying your health insurance expired because, you didn't work enough last year.
Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?
That's a good call. Right.
Why can't you tell her?
It doesn't scare me!
Well you know, we got to talking and uh, he said he needed a place and I had a spare room.
Well, if I was wearing your underwear then, uh, what would you be wearing?. . . You're swell.
'Kay.
That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!
Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was Deep Impact and which one was Armageddon?
Hey!
Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions.
Well I, I think we'd remember something like that.
Still broken?
I'm not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.
Well, I've got a girl in here.
What are you doing?
I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. So please wake up so we can do it right!
Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?
...and then it got canceled.
Hello Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day.
All right, bye-bye now!
Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser?
I'm not your garbage man. I'm your mailman.
Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.
I'm still on London time, does that count?
Yeah.
Oh, I have to get married in James Bond's tux!
What?
Excuse me, Doug? Hey there sports fan!!
You burn your mouth?
Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 8:00.
Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?
Okay.
Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.
Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.
Do not speak ill of the dead.
Okay, it's not a guy, all right, I know her.
No way!
Y'know I think you can take her.
Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.
What are you talking about?
Hi! Hi! You're crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.
Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.
What?
No. I'm not letting you or anybody else see, ever.
How is that worse?!
Ross, it's just a sandwich!
Basically we just feel that he's...
Okay...
Your just, your just clearly not familiar with our young persons vernacular. See, when we say dad, we mean buddy. We mean pal.
Yes it would. What do you say to $50?
Look, Ross, you have what you want, you're back with Rachel. If you bring this up now you're gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.
Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?
Okay.
Sure, why not?
And Milton Berle has a...
Ladies, ladies, let's just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take off Monica's bra.
Don't go.
Yeah!
What's going on?
Hey.
But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, because my Mom won't let me cross the street.
So um, Mary-Angela, what's your second favorite?
Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
A pharmacist.
Look man!
More importantly, was I any good?
Which I may say, right now, is out of control.
Aww!
She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!
It's the Miracle Wax.
Joey, it's been three days, okay.. Your just a little homesick, Okay. Would you just try to relax. Just, just try to enjoy yourself.
Absolutely! Y'know, because touchie can mean both ass and good worker.
So did Monica tell you about this great band called the Swing Kings that we're trying to get to play at the wedding?
Okay! You don't think I thought of that?
You can tell us.
Oh, uhh, actually I uh, have some news.
Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?
Well, I ended up telling her everything.
All right look, if you're not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!
So this is nice! I wish I didn't have to go, believe me! But unfortunately I have to. Oh uh, by the way, what's the name the girl you're dating?
Your little men are gonna get scored on more times than your sister.
No! Shhh!
Absolutely!
Aww, thanks man.
Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?
No!
