Damnit!
Okay. See you guys later.
Sort of...
Shhhh!
Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal.
Huh? Uh...
Hey, Pheebs! It's Joey!
All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies?
Great...Great...and thanks for being so understanding. I mean, I didn't want to make a big deal out of this, you know. You could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room. I mean, if you want to.
Good, otherwise my watch would fall off.
Oh, come on Rach! My turn just started!
That sounds fair.
How about a scone on the house baby?
Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y'know? Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It's all about turnover.
Goodnight.
I mean, there's no way I can make myself taller now, y'know? And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?
Ross! So when is it gonna air?
So what's it gonna be?
Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any past life memories.
I don't want to talk about it. Y'know, you could've at least saved me a whole cookie.
Oh really! Where? Somewhere funny I'd bet!
Good for you. Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?
Well I don't know remember exactly but, it's-it's pretty much about having and giving and sharing and receiving.
I don't think so.
What?!
What?
Sure. Coffee? 'Cause I'm going up there.
That's kinda nice.
Hey, it's gonna be all right.
I'll be playing Drake Remoray's twin brother, Stryker!
Who?
Well, you're amazing.
Ohh!
Hey!
Hi.
I fall down an elevator shaft? What the hell does this mean, I fall down an elevator shaft?
Hey! Chef Geller! Y'know that little speech you made the other day? Well I got a problem with it!
All right! Man, this is unbelievable!
Please don't kick Monica and Rachel out, this wasn't there fault, it was mine.
'Cause it's always somethin', you know, like Monica's new job, or the whole Ross's birthday hoopla.
Thank you.
We've only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think I gotta get her something?
That makes sense!
Howdy partner!
Or... just get a card that has a poem already in it.
Wow! That was incredible! Beard of bees, here I come!
When was the last time someone told you just how beautiful you are?
All right, all right. "Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart!"
What?
Hey, that's never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!
What's in it?
"...when I look back over our time together..."
Okay! All right, I'll see ya. We got it! We got it!
Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive?
Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again.
Wait up!
Are you kidding me?! She's gonna this boat!
Monica and Rachel made out.
Okay, but let's say there was. How might that go?
Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!
Hey, pretty smart! Tissue paper! You're at the wedding, you have to cry, "Handkerchief?" "No-no, I got my invitation."
Hey!
I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven't really paid the bill
Hey buddy! How's it going?
Yeah! Yeah sure, just long as it's handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold.
Phoebe?
This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas.
Hey! Get into gear!
My folks.
Calm down, do you want this unit or not?
Women are mean!!!
Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn.
You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!
How come the writing is in Spanish?
I'm out.
I don't know.
Supposably. Supposably. Did they go to the zoo? Supposably.
OK, listen I've been on sets before, so let me give you a little advice, alright? It's a show, but we're just dancing, OK? It's no big deal. The important thing to remember &#150; stay cool.
Oh, her ankles are a little chubby.
The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it! You always have to think about the trail!
Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.
Yeah. No-no I-I know I might not win, but it's just...I've never even been nominated before! I want it so much.
Okay. Okay. Ace!
All right. I can't see.
Hey.
Oh well listen, anyway she's directing the new Al Pacino movie. You gotta get me an audition!
Why can't I find that?
Well, so, stay for the museums!
Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.
Think it'll work?
So, you were both dorks. Big deal.
All right well, I'd better take that back.
Now, wh-what, what is that like?
Okay, you hide my clothes. I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you.
She's a woman!
Ok, ok, How about if we split it?
I finished my book.
No, they-they weren't in the play.
No. Y'know how we're always saying we need a place for the mail.
That sketch you mentioned? Might it have looked a little something like this?
God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, 'Oh, I'm so talented.' and 'Oh, I'm so pretty,' and 'Ooh, I smell so good.'
Hey, dude, let me in. I got a girl out here!
Hey, what's up?
Kiss her! Kiss her!
I couldn't help it, there love is so pure.
Who's Rick?
All right, uh, we've got a little bit of a problem here. These people are my friends; you can't treat them that way.
Is something wrong?
Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?
Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea.
Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross.
Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.
Ohh, well, that's ok then. But, okay my towels for instance. I come in to the bathroom here and my towel is not on the floor where keep it. It's up here on some hook..and...smells different.
No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole.
Yeah, he did, look... look, it's right there on the counter! Ha-ho-ho!
That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.
Glow-pop giggly jammer.
Really? I don't...
Oh hey, here Pheebs.
Well, first it's not a purse.
I was afraid of that.
4:30.
Is that why you're on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause if it is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone.
Phoebe, this was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.
C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit.
Uh hey look uh Ross, look I think we need to talk about before.
Well that's how I feel.
Go get 'em Treeger.
I don't know. What are you wearing?
Come on Rach! No one saw me take it! There was a whole table full of 'em.
I don't know! Charity?
Well, y'know those special skills I have listed on my resume? I would love it would be great if one of those was true.
No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally.
What's the game?! What's the game?!
Whoah!
Need a new table.
Really?!
Where've you been?
No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot.
What?! Wait-wait-wait! The handsome man was about to enter!!
Well, they go into the chipper.
That's...kinda hot.
Gotcha. Phoebs, walk with me.
I don't know uhh... Well, I'm Joey. Yeah, I'm disgusting, I take my underwear off in other people's homes.
What are they doing out here? The coast's all the way over there.
What's my little chef got for me tonight?
Yeah, sure. Well, you must be new here. Maybe we should-I'm sorry, can I ask you something?
Okay. Well, if that's how you feel about it, fine! None of you get to live with me in my great big hand-shaped mansion! Except uh, you Pheebs. You can live in the thumb.
Uhh, that's not them. I'm gonna go call the police.
We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...
My beers?! Look you guys, she's a very nice girl. Okay? We had a good time, but I just-I don't see it going anywhere.
Guys! Guys!! You gotta let me nap! Ugh, I'm gonna get cranky!
All right, relax. It's just a shoe.
Uhhhh.
See ya! All right Pheebs, I am ready for my first lesson.
Well, you're timing couldn't be better. She's not my girlfriend anymore.
Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is...
Hey, Ross, want some cider?
Oh yeah! I got in there myself once. My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn't, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in. Yeah. It was funny 'til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.
That's how they do pants! Ross, will you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?
Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. We're going to a New Year's Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great! Y'know? But if she says 'Dude, what the hell are you doing?' I can say 'It wasn't me, it was New Years!'
No. Why?
Quick volleyball question.
I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!
Wow, it is easy. Now, I can have milk everyday.
You don't keep it over here on this table any more?
I don't know.
This is crazy.
What about Game 1 of the Series?
Thanks.
What are you doing?
You look good.
Oh it was great. Yeah, you get to say stuff like, 'Hey, the bell doesn't dismiss you, I dismiss you.'
Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! ...You brought your kids.
You could?
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Like-like when I'm doing something exciting and I don't wanna get too excited, I just ahh, y'know try to thing of other things like ah sandwiches, and ah baseball, and ah Chandler!
I just have to call my agent and tell her I can't do the part.
Hey!! We are so in luck! Treeger said that we could have all this cool stuff from the basement. Wait right there.
I guess I'm done.
You spit on me man!
No-no, she really is sick!
Hey! Is the show still on?
Oh, a couple of nurses asked them out. Maybe they're with them.
Alright, look, I'll start, OK?
No-no-no, I'm serious. You don't smell it? Something's on fire.
Hey Pheebs!
Ow!
Good night.
Nah, I'm too depressed to eat. I'll probably eat in like 5 minutes. So I guess I'll just fly home with you guys, what time's your flight?
No we weren't!
I'm not finished.
'Sup? 'Sup dude?
Hang up, hang up.
All right, here we go.
Fine, make fun. I think it's jaunty.
Yeah! And you have so many more choices than you do with men's underwear!
Rach, these are for you.
Okay, maybe he's not his best friend, but ...
The country?
Haaaaa! Hey-hey, thanks for stopping our ball.
Hey you guys, this is my agent, Estelle.
I'm gonna be on two TV shows!
Okay, Phoebe...
Hello.
No you don't, I just saw you go in there with Monica!
Charity.
Ok, I got one, I got one. Uh, if he blows into one, does the other one get bigger?
Hey, if we know it can we have candy?!!
But why?! I should've won one and I really want it and she didn't even care enough to come to the thing! It could also be a Grammy.
The country.
Like what?
Hi!
Oh! Tell her she's not marriage material.
No, the quiet down thing!
The Mr. Bowmont's here!!!
Because they wanted me to audition!
I think I left a donut up here.
I like her so much!
And you feel like we hold you back.
Hey! So I'm back.
I think you're right.
Yeah. We figured when we couldn't find you, you'd gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?
Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition.
I know, and only one layer of jam?! What is up with that?
Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I'm not even sure I got it.
Look, you and I have been given a gift. Okay? We have to do something with it. Like-like, hand modeling! Huh? Or-or magic! And you know NASA's gonna wanna talk to us!
Look, I don't have it all worked out yet, but it's gotta mean big money! Come on! Identical hands!
Yeah! I made it of this fruit bowl I found in the garbage.
Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper.
Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.
Yeah, my agent just called me with an audition for Days of Our Lives!
Well maybe I love ya'.
Can I ask you something?
Yeah baby!
That's not food...No, I don't, no... Everything's different here...I want to go home. I...I miss my family. I miss the coffee house. I can't even remember what Phoebe looks like.
Dude! What the hell are you doing?! God!
That's my line! I can take it from here, thanks. Dearly beloved, I'm sorry I'm a little late. You may be confused by this now, but you won't be Memorial Day weekend 2002. Well, let's get started before the groom takes off again. Huh? We are gathered here today, to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. I've known Monica and Chandler for a long time, and I can not imagine two people more perfect for each other. And now, as I've left my notes in my dressing room. We shall proceed to the vows. Monica?
You could say that.
Hi!
You got screwed.
Oh, you didn't see the Post?
Road trip! Yeah, we can rent a car! I just have to be there by Tuesday!
What?
Oh, that poor bastard.
Hey!
I don't know.
I thought we talked about this. I don't like pulp. No pulp. Pulp isn't juice. All juice, okay?
Y'know what Ross? I'm not gonna let you get away with this!
Why did I have to start working out again? Damn you 15s!
Oh.
Boyfriend?
Ohhhh, good one! And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country.
Well then help me get it off! Plus, it smells really bad in here.
Not from where I was standin.
Yeah, she broke up with me.
Well! What happened?! Did we miss it?
No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we'll be supportive like crazy.
"Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There, faster!"
Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I...
The bigger half.
Well-I got a head rush from standing up to fast right there.
Hey.
No-no.
This is like the temporary robot, right?
Oh, y'know, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!
Thanks Ross. I really like that bird though...I'll take the dog though.
Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English.
Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?
Ah, Kate?
You're in!
Uh...Cookie?
Not a problem. And listen, hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while, why don't-I was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine.
Because of... the reason.
All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot on there that you don't have.
Cool.
I don't know, it smells good.
You're fake laughing too, right?
What're you doin' here? Aren't you supposed to be out with Rachel?
Hey, you guys are still gonna come visit me, right?
Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.
Hey, don't get religious on me, ok. A guy in your position needs to be a little better at relaxing. You know. Why do you think we have the comfortable chairs? Huh...come here...sit down. Ready? Ahh!! Ohh, yeah!! Huh?!
Well, thank you. So, can we play 20 Questions now? I've got a really good one! I've been thinking about it since Kansas.
Yeah, that makes sense.
That's right! I helped you guys out a lot in the start of your relationship. Huh? I helped you guys sneak around for like six months, and I looked like an idiot! And I was humiliated. And I only made 200 dollars!
Ah, it's career stuff. I don't know if you heard but they killed off my character on the show.
Okay!
Yes!!
Yeah, you missed, 'Takes money to make money,' and uh, 'Don't make me come down there and kick your wall street butt.'
Angela? Joey Tribiani. Listen, what are ya doing tonight. I know your seeing that guy I was thinking maybe you could bring him.....Hello? Hello?
Yeah! If you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!
Uh-huh.
My god, Angela.
Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died?
I am... free!
Look, there's nothing I can do for him right now, he's still in his sweat pants, that's still Phase One. Y'know? I'll be back for Phase Two, I would never miss Phase Two.
Well then maybe I will.
Yeah!
How good is that?
Hey guys!
Saw the Porsche out there Mon, lookin' good. When do I get to take that baby out again?
You seen Sandy?
No, I don't. It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you think that when you get it it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would be. But this so was. Ya know, it changed everything. Like the other day, I got this credit card application, and I was pre- approved. Huh? I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life.
I'm fine with it, I mean, if you're OK watching a video filled with two nippled people.
Yeah, you can get a Volvo. If that's what you really want.
Oh wow! He's so lifelike! Unbelievable! (He starts tugging on the guy's ears.
Hey! No-no-no-no, you can't take him away from me! I got a great partner to pick up girls with! Finally!!
Nooooo.
It's called Shutter Speed, it's really cool! Yeah, umm, I meet this girl in the subway and we fall in love in like a day, right? And then, she disappears... But I find out where she lives and when I get there this like old lady answers the door and I say, "Where's Betsy?" Right? And she says, "Betsy's been dead for 10 years."
Hello.
Oh, it's this big budget period movie about these three Italian brothers who come to America around the turn of the century. It's really classy! Oh, and the director is supposed to be the next, next Martin Scorcese.
Well, I think it went pretty well. I.. I got a callback for Thursday.
Okay, get ready to owe me!
Hey! I'm off to my audition. How do I look?
Yeah. Yeah.
Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she's like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!
I've got Ben.
Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how you'd handle maid of honor type situations.
Oww! Big ring!
Okay. I got nominated for my part on Days of Our Lives!
Hello?
Why not?
Yeah, you don't want that.
Well, so anyway Beth, what I'm saying is I should've considered your feelings before I went home with you that night. I've ah, I've recently learned what's it like to be on your side of it, and I'm sorry. So, do you think you can forgive me? Great. Thanks. Okay, bye. Hello, Jennifer? Oh hi, Mrs. Loreo, is Jennifer there? Oh, she's not home huh? Well ah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.
Oh, Chandler.
Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads.
All right look, Ross, he's right. Emily's great, she's great! But this way too soon, you're only gonna scare her!
Okay! We'll need a six-pack of Zima.
Dude, I don't know.
That's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross!
Closed set. We know but we're friends with the monkey.
Hey.
Hey, I don't need violence to enjoy a movie. Just so long as there's a little nudity.
I've gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy!
Rach! Hey! It's fine! You're at Joey's!
No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.
I know, I know, but look at the knobs on her.
We're gonna climb Mt. Everest!
Well uh, it's just that uh, y'know if-if you're gonna be wearing someone's sweatshirt shouldn't it be your boyfriends--and I'm not him.
I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out.
Well, when Jake did it I saw that...he was wearing women's underwear!
Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job.
Oh my God, quick turn off the TV.
Done.
I know! That's why we got to find Monica!! You know where she is?
No you won't.
Yes! Guess who's in an audition for a Broadway musical?
Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything. I haven't dreamt about her like that since I found out about you two--ish.
Noo! Nothing!
It's not on my head.
Well I guess I should've thought about my wife and kids before I talked back to chef Geller!
Okay.
Good enough to get fired.
Oh, so your weekend was a total bust?
Yeah. Sorry about that. Oh, hey little girl. Uhh, is-is your mommy, or sister, or babysitter by any chance a hot girl?
Thank you. Wait wait wait wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am. . .
I just had a glass.
Umm, hi.
My identical hand twin!
No! I want an award I did win! But nobody's giving me any of those! Plus-Hey Rach, if-if I put it up there right? When people come over they'll see it and they'll think I won it.
Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza. But, hey, look, if I get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper?
I got a gig!
Well, you should've told me that before, I'm not a mind reader. Hey, we're out of beer. I'm going to Monica's.
Maybe he, uhh... drives his car on the other side of the road, if ya know what I mean.
Yeah, and when you do, he'll be lucky to have you.
Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast. You know, after having slept with her.
Gotcha.
I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, y'know, I just wanted to do a good deed. Like-like you did with the babies.
Dude, tell me she actually told you this.
Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said they're gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders.
I guess you wouldn't believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?
Naa, they said that when they found my body, my brain was so smashed in that the only doctor that could have saved me was me. Supposed to be some kind of irony or somethin.
Bye!
So did that do anything for ya?
Yeah!
Yeah I'll take that.
Oh, forget about it. She rocks!
What?
Rach we had to get out of there because, look what I won!
But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I don't know anything about technology! I can't even use Chandler's computer except to find porn! And-and that's only 'cause it's right there when you turn it on!
Where's Kate?
Yeah?
Yeah, you do!
Hey Chandler, do we know that lady?
C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head.
Yeah-yeah, it's down to me and two other guys.
Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.
You can totally tell! Here look, watch me. Smile! Frown. Smile! Frown. Smile!
Awful! Horrible!
Hey.
: That book got me through some tough times.
Guggly worm.
I'm sorry. See ya.
Or an uncle...
Yeah, I mean it's never taken me a week to get over a relationship.
All right back off! I gotta gun! I'm not afraid to use it!
Are you really not going?
Hey!
Bye.
Hey!
Hey! I made that for her!
Hey!
Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook.
What's the matter with Rog?
What?
Yep, it's fat. I drank fat!
Nothing. It's just old and dingy, that's all.
Yeah, it's okay. I know what a mainsail is. I know, I know to duck when the boom comes across. I-I know port is right.
Yeah you see umm, well, I'm an actor. Right? So I gotta keep my emotions right at the surface y'know? See what I'm saying? I gotta lot of balls in the air. Y'know what I mean? It's tough! Guys like me, y'know, you wander around, you're alone...
She's gone.
Yeah, the Knicks rule!
All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty.
Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.
Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we... y'know each would, y'know be?
Man, she is going to have a great time! Is she staying at the Hotel Corona?
Okay.
Francette? What is she? A couch?
Come on, Lydia, you can do it. Push! Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder, harder. Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out! Let's get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho. Let's I was justyeah, right. Push! Push!
What?
Not as upset as he's gonna be when he finds out what I did with his sweater vests!
Thanks, you are such a good friend. And this is so weird.
Me too.
Hey, dude, let me in. I got a girl out here!
Sorry. Wrong boobies.
I know! All right, I'll see you guys over there! I'm off to fight the Nazis.
Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!
I know! They suck!!
Oh, I had the opposite dream.
Ohh. Wow! Well how-how, how will you be gone?
Well he actually saw you a little bit too.
Wow! Huh? Mac Macaveli, Private Investigator!
That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that?
Did I say you could smell it?!
Hey, here's a thought, Ross.
Are you all right?
All right, all right.
I know, it was amazing! I mean, we totally nailed it, it was beautiful.
No, I'm good.
I don't know. Why? Did you hear something?
This is what I've got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a lot of liquor.
Hey Gunther, let me get a lemonade to go.
Seriously?
How do you do there, Wayne?
Wow. Thanks. So, uh, what happened?
Yes.
When they're hungry enough, they'll come in.
Say it... say it!
No it's not weird, it's a miracle!
Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.
No, but it's okay. She just came in and gave him a hug, that it.
Oh my God! Those are almost right on the floor!
Yeah, well, I couldn't find any cards, so it was either this or Strip Bag Of Old Knitting Stuff.
You're gonna mess it up let me do it.
Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise.
Oh well then, good night!
Yeah! Well, well really it's three. Please. You're so good at it. I love you.
Man, I wish Ross was coming with us! Y'know? I'm gonna miss him!
You meant sex, right?
So how you two gettin' along?
Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.
Dude, you should've gone out once and a while.
Oh.
Nice!
Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, y'know?
What was it?
Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out.
You?
I couldn't even if I wanted too.
You're blowin' me off for a monkey?
Right, I go-, I got it.
Woah, woah, woah, you have a date?
Oh, hey! Joey Tribbiani.
Done.
Oh my god, I got my very own stalker.
This is impossible Monica, why don't you just pick all 15?
No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
The reactor's gonna blow in three seconds, we're never gonna make it!
Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. So when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes.
Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!
No, but if you're willing to cook naked, then you might be willing to dance naked. And then...
All right!
Hey.
Hey! He beat ya.
Uhh, look, your eye's still popping out a little, I'm gonna go get some ice.
OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met.
Yeah! And-and things aren't as...smashed down as I thought they were gonna be.
I got it! Here we go.
Okay, all right, whew! What do you say we all clear out of here and let these two lovebirds get back down to business? Hey-hey-hey, I-I-I'm just talking here, he-he's the one doing your sister.
I was tryin' to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I'm gonna do?
Hiya!
Pheebs! There you are!
I'm sorry but we've got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in here. I, uh, I got to be a man! Okay. The living room has to remain a guy place, okay? That's just the way it has to be.
What? Chandler! Tell 'em!
Whoa, I'm not done.
Yeah, someplace nice. How much do you think I can get for my kidney?
Uhhh, yeah. Yeah. But uh, I don't think it's the kind you're gonna like.
Oh-ho, you should get inside my head.
All the way to the airport huh? You know that's over 30 miles, that's gonna cost you about so bucks.
What are you talking about? It was a big deal. I mean, come on you can't tell me last night didn't mean something to you. I-I was there, you're not that good an actress.
You guys don't think I look 19?
Seriously, good game though. Good game. What are they so mad about? They get the apartment back!
All right that's it! You're yelling and I don't see you taking your top off! I quit!
Okay, Ross, look-look-look-look, look right here. That's called a scrum, okay? It's kinda like a huddle.
I won! That was my guess!
Wh-why?
Hey.
Get down!
No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks.
I don't need to think about it. I was Dr. Drake Remoray. That was huge. Big things are gonna happen, you'll see. Ross, you still there?
I want to make a ship to shore call to Chandler.
Okay, here! I wanna be the on camera guy. All right, first stop, Westminster Abbey.
What are you in love with her or something?
What?
Okay.
Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!
Hi.
Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first.
Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you.
Hey, hey, look at that talent.
Whatever.
No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception.
Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the strongest Power Ranger is?
Does it have to be a whole day?
Ahhh.
Oh-oh, what about Ross?
Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?
So, assistant to the director. That's a really exciting job, I mean, you must have a ton of cool responsibilities.
Hey, how you doin'?
Name one!
I know.
So you're really doing this, huh?
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I get 'ya?
Well, how-how come?
Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?
Ahhhhhhhhhh...
Have you seen Monica?
What did you say to him?
Woo-hoo! All right! Yeah!
Thanks! Let's keep going.
Uhh, cause, uhh, I'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal chokage. Alright, look, I got to tell you something.
Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross?
Cute! This is Janice! You remember Janice?
Boy I tell ya, this little talent came in handy before I could afford porn.
Yes! There's still pie.
What?
Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place.
Ma! What're you doing here?
Come on Ross! Look, I-I don't have any brothers; I'll never get to be a best man!
Ross has some big thing to tell everyone.
You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.
Okay, you watch too much TV.
Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?
Monica? What time is it?
All right, so we'll get a little coffee, and get energized, and we'll head back out.
Oh, no no no. Its for Ursula. I just figured, you know, size-wise.
Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice.
Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing.
All right. Good deal.
Hey!
I don't believe this!
"Heckles, you crack me up in science class. You're the funniest kid in school.
Oh it's water under the bridge, forget it!
Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Chandler, listen.
I'm so sorry.
What do you got there?
And while we're down at the video store, you know what else we could rent? Die Hard! Oh, y'know what? I just remembered, that Everest thing is only available through mail order.
You have Knicks tickets?
Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project.
Yeah.
Somebody wanna help me out here?
Yeah?
Who-ah-ho.
What's he doin' in my section?
Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000. Can you believe that? $5,000!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-whoa! We could have our own show! Y'know we could clap our hands together people will love it! Huh? And-and-and I wrote a song for us! This hand is your hand! This hand is my hand! Oh wait, that's your hand! No wait, it's my hand!
All right.
Hey.
Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so...
This is crazy! Hey look, I wanna switch to Rachel!
Havin' some trouble?
Yeah!
The fruit roll up.
Hey.
No-no, things ah, finally happened with Kate.
Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?
Hey-hey don't look at me! I just work here!
Ohh, no, no. We're not going to just sit. Shhh.
Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!
Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song. Ready? One, two, three, four...
Maybe that's the problem.
Well, we were! But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out!
Look, do you want the ring or not?!
So! Things can go wrong! You don't know! What if he doesn't make it?!
All right! Hey-hey!
Me too. Alright, whattaya got.
How's she doing?
Well, I'm pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey, Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy.
Yeah, she is. Wow! How you doin'?
Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...'
But you're still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today.
Really?
Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang!
You won't boss me around anymore?
Oh, I got it! How about saying something like, "Monica...
Aaaaagggghhhhh. Mommy
No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.
Well, I'm- I'm showering.
Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!
Well then, do it better!
Hey Rach!
I-I can't handle this, you guys.
Great! Thanks.
Ok ok ok ok. Monica, we'll bring him, but only if he takes the Jaguar.
Morning. We ready to go?
Food? Uh-huh gimme!
Oh and Okay, and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it, I learned something in acting class, try uh, rubbing your stomach or uh, or saying "mmm" and uh, oh oh! And smiling , okay?
That one will.
Ross, you're mayor of the zone.
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! She obviously didn't understand the question.
And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees.
Look, I told ya, I'm not going to any clinic! I don't have a problem, you're the one with the problem! You should go to a "Quit being a baby and leave me alone" clinic!
No-no-no I've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret?
Ross!
Hey! How's it going?
Can I come?! I won't even talk! You'll just hear the noise from my video camera.
Oh my.
If the Homo Sapiens, were in fact 'Homo-sapien', is that why there extinct?
Too long! Oh my God, Rach, I've been dying to talk to someone about this for so long! Listen, listen, we can't say anything about this to anybody, they're so weird about that! Listen...
No ma'am.
Hey!
What kind of smell?
Okay, what if the puppy said, "Help me Chandler. All the other puppies pick on me."
Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?
Well, the duck...
Wow, what a cool job. 'You have two new messages.' 'Please, pass the pie.'
That's it, just hey. Like at the end of a dance, HEY! Hey. He-hey.
Hey!
Hey.
Okay, for next time, what do you say?
Okay.
What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.
Okay.
Ahh, alright, alright, alright, I was young and I just wanted a job, OK. But at the last minute I couldn't go through with it so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can't 'cause there's people havin' sex on it.
You said number two.
So, does that mean the audition is off?
Yes!!! Ha-ha-ha!
I knew that! I sooo didn't know that, but you should see your faces.
I'm tellin' ya, he hasn't moved since this morning.
That's not, prison lingo, is it?
That tone will not make me go any faster.
What?
So the Porsche guy took his car back.
Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked.
So?
What? What's wrong?
Oh, hey. Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive you nuts before too, remember?
Yeah right!
Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die?
She was nothing compared to you.
Uhh, my stunt double. Yeah, and y'know, he's getting a little too familiar for my tastes.
Y'miss it?
Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.
Ooh, so close.
Really?
I don't know.
It'll be great! We-we could talk, and play games! Huh? This could be our chance to like renew our friendship.
Well maybe I got a little upset and maybe I told them where they could go.
Right! Okay.
And of course, crotchless panties.
Hey, don't get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!
Hey.
Oh we kissed it up real nice.
All right, we have to pick captains.
Hello?
I don't know whether it's just 'cause we're breakin' up or... what, but you have never looked so beautiful.
It's All Relative.
Yeah.
Yeah, is Sidney there? Oh, this is? Sidney's a woman.
Marcel?
Hey.
All right, let's go Pheebs.
Do you know something?
So I uh, I just talked to the director. That's it, we're done for the day.
Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that's all. I mean, come on, it's just a little wax.
Like this. Pictures of cute babies we don't know. We..we can't have that.
What about Ross? I mean, are you still mad at him cause he made that list about you?
Lookin' good Mr. Cotter.
Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain?
I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore.
Hey-hey dude, why are you changing the subject? Why? Will you make the call or what?
Aw crap! Okay-uh...uh let's-let's do the rings.
All right, here's a list of things for you to do today. Man, this going to be so great! Thank you so much! All right, I got to go to work I'm delivering twins today, but only one of them is mine!
Yeah, Big Brother.
Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Y'know? The only problem is, Carl's acting is...
Well, I'm makin money now and this is payin' you back for head shots, electric bills, and so many slices of pizza I can't even count. I love ya man.
No! Forget it! Okay-I mean thanks, but I'm done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, what's next? Come on.
When is she leaving?
Incredible! I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was.
Look, Ross, really it's-it's no big deal. Y'know you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can't be friends at work, then so be it. Y'know, hey I understand. Y'know? Hey, when I'm in a play and you're in the audience, I don't talk to you, right? So it's y'know, it's uh, it's cool. I'll see you tomorrow.
Oh, well. Just ask her how long she's gonna live. Women live longer than men.
Movies?
Dude-dude, who would you rather have kiss your sister, me or Chandler?
You got married to fast.
You do?
All right.
Whoa! Whoa! Guys! Please! Come on! Come on! This is obviously just a big misunderstanding.
Eggs. Who's eggs do you like better, his or mine, huh?
That's ridiculous! I'm not a "Star," just a regular famous actor.
It worked! I scared ya, I knew it! Ha-ha!
That's crazy.
Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.
I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!
No-no! I used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff, remember? Let's see uh, well I don't want to donate sperm again. I really prefer doing that at the home office y'know? Ooh-ooh, maybe they want like some of my blood or-or spit or something, huh?
What's up with Gene?
$200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did to ya?
Oh no! No!! My hole!!
Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight!
Okay, first-first of all, you want to make it look spontaneous. I look down , look down, keep looking down; then I look up. See? All right, now you try. Look down , you're looking down, keep looking down...
Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?!
Pretty nice?
Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something. Uh, I was just over there talking to Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight.
Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous.
Ooh, it's probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, I'm kinda....
No-no-no-no-no.
Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right?
Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room.
Hey! Y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when we get Chinese food?
Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is it's the same day as my niece's christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me. 'Cause my part's just in the beginning I'm not even in the rest of the show-Wedding!
Hey, you're back!
Ah.
Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too.
Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big? This is your baby. Hi Daddy!
Oooh.
Huh.
Look I'm sorry you guys, I-I just don't think so.
Needs some clothes altered?
Check.
What? You ordered pizza without me?!
Sorry Phoebe.
Is this movie gonna be my big break?
Yeah, you hang in there Teddy!
I wanna rock and roll all night!
I'm sorry man, I didn't-I'm-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Ross! Way to suck up to the family.
And, uhh, maybe the watering can there.
Na-uh! Hey did anybody lose their keys?
Ooh, I'll play! I'll play!
Me too.
Pheebs! There you are! Okay, you broke my fridge; you owe me 400 bucks!
Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?
It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock! Huh?
Okay, done.
Okay. See?! I told ya!
What about Andre?
Okay.
No, it's just my luggage.
Yeah that dog left!
What do you mean?
I did not know that! Thank you Monica. I can't believe I almost lost another girl because of counting.
Then you're not invited.
Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger?
Oh my God.
I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.
All right, I'm gonna go say hi the chick and the duck.
YES!!
Oh, tell me about it. And she's been on the show forever, it's gonna be really hard to fill her shoes.
Look, maybe I need to try a real teacher! Right here! Here! Andy Cooper, he teaches guitar and look ooh, there's a nice picture of him with a little kid and THE KID'S GOT A GUITAR!!!!!!
Ten. Okay. Now Tag there's such a thing as to many women.
Okay.
What are you guys woofing about?
Pretty much, yeah.
Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks! Okay? She-she-she's hurting me.
G'night.
He said that he wasn't gonna apologize because you guys are living here illegally, so instead what he's gonna do is have you evicted-I'll see you later.
That's what you told me.
Don't worry about that man, that happens.
Excuse me, Aaron? Hi! Umm, I have a little problem with the schedules. Originally, I wasn't supposed to work today, and I have this wedding that I really have to be at. It's my best friend's, and I'm officiating so I really can't work past four.
Great! Roomie!
Oh, you bet I am!
No, no, no, don't get up, I got a cooler right here.
Hey guys!
With this ring? No contest.
That's Fergie baby!!
Hey, how much did you guys tip the super this year?
Had the beef-tips, huh?
You know you've been spitting on me?!
Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
Sorry, sorry.
Or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them.
Glass of fat?
It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.
Oh, y'know what? It's probably just your burnin' loins.
Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!
Here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.
She keeps punching me.
What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.
She was nothing compared to you.
The Unbearable Likeness of Being!
Wha? Wha..aa? Let me get the father. Hey, we need a father over here! We need a father!
Hey!
Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?
You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?
What?
Hey!
Shhhh!
Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.
Yes! Yes! You did and you're still yelling at me!
Miracle!
Whoa-whoa-hey-hey! Hi, Paul is it?
All right, but in the future...
Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today.
No. No way, I'm not signing that.
Chandler, is that...
Well, just shimmy down me and drop!
So ah, Phoebe tells us you write jingles.
I don't think so.
The Empty Vase. Translucent beauty...
I found my identical hand twin!
Huh?
Duh, where've you been?
I can't tell you that, no.
All right, now you know that the ATM will only lets you take out 300 at a time, I'll take a check for the other hundred.
Woo-hoo!!
Okay.
Not good, no. I didn't get the part, and I lost my job here, so ...
Uh... Phoebe? Phoebe?
Hello.
Oh Monica. Wow, this guy's an astronaut. That would've been cool, for like a day. .
Hey, the fight's starting!
Hi!
Okay. Uhh, tortilla chips, yogurt.
So y'know Ross it's funny 'cause, you look familiar to me too. Have you ever been married?
Right, they uh, they choppered me in. What's up?
Chandler?
Sorry!
Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah.
So what're you guys gonna eat?
Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women.
Seriously, you like it? This guy was sellin' them on 8th avenue and I looked at 'em and I though, you know what I don't have?
Look, we're not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own hands!
Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment.
Umm, do you see any-oh, Vaseline?
Well, he's not used to women being so forward with him; but uh, I good check with him-He says it's okay. Great! Thanks! Bye-bye!
Definitely!
Oh, hey listen! The Soapie's called today and I also get to present an award.
That guy's like a cartoon. What do you see in him anyway?
You should both know, that he's a dead man. Oh, Chandler?
Yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward, split five ways!!
They were in his office.
What message?
Hey, let's go look at it!
You can pee here!
All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad's cabin. Just me, her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic dinner....
Oh, you said it Mike. Aw! There's got to be a better way!
Right! And when is that due?
And he never played before either! Y'know what I think? I think beginner's luck, very important in Cups.
It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! This is great! I'm getting more dates than ever!
I bet I stopped listening before you did.
So what? I drove down, sold T-shirts, had a blast. And y'know who knows how to party? Drunk college chicks.
What?!
You guys! You guys! You're not gonna believe what my agent just told me!
Phoebs, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out.
What-what's so funny?
Thank you.
Oh, you're kidding me! All-all right, well make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes. Okay? I'm an actor; I'm kinda getting my picture up there on the wall.
Yeah well, I'm guessing after this she's not going to be crazy about electricity either.
Oh there is! If you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen!
C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!
Uhh do you happen to have a hot girl in there?
Oh, that sounds like fun, but we've got a ring to find!!
Yeah, I was bummed too.
Me too! Me too! Me too!
Why wouldn't ya? Erin is great! Then-then there's you guys.
Wow! This looks great!
Ross good, I'm uh glad you're here. I wanna talk to you about something.
No I won't.
What did they do?
Why should I help you?!
Hey, y'know Ross, I think I kinda understand why I kinda lost it today.
All right, I guess this will be fine.
Yeah!
Thanks for stopping by. See ya! I-I am so sorry. I...
Wait a second, I could star in it!
Hey!
Ooooooh.
Oh my God, you're back!
We'll just see.
We don't need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, we'll head down to the docks and see about that boat thing.
Hey guys. Listen uh, you wanna get some dinner with me and Kathy tonight?
Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey!!
The vicar!
Oh well, hey, Joey's loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he'll be there.
Okay, I guess it doesn't seem that weird.
Monica, pigeons learn faster that you.
Phoebe, what-what are you doing?!
Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have $1200? I'm home in the middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess there's a few things you don't get from book learnin'.
Ahoy!
Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London.
All right!
Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States.
Yeah I did!
I didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok.
WHAT?!!
And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!
Hey, Mon! I'm not doing anything, why don't you fire me?
Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say. And with Joey, I pretty much have to make it up on my own.
Look at that, Charlton Heston eating a liquorice whip!
Ross and Rachel left us a message saying they were getting married! Isn't that why you guys are here?
This is for my boat, pretty cool huh?
Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks!
Who's Paul?
Tell us!
Hey.
You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there's this one other audition that I really, really want, and Estelle couldn't get me in.
And I was tired from digging the huge hole!
Thanks. Thanks, but uh actually it's just gonna be me again tonight.
Yeah.
Listen, drama critics they're nothing but, but people who couldn't make it as actors. You know what you should do?
What?
Out.
Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know I guess I just got scared.
Na, na I'm ok. Oh and uh, just so you know, I'm not movin' back in 'cause I have to. Well, I mean, I do have to. It's just that that place wasn't really, I mean, this is...
Ross, you don't have to yell.
Yeah it is. . . what?
Hard to say.
What?
Oh well-Hey-hey! Maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing. Y'know? It'll-it'll give you a chance to shake things up, play different characters. You're so talented.
Soooooo... you are now looking at Dr. Drake Ramore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at least four episodes!
See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'. Can you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good mother.
Hey. I spent the night out. I met this cute bridesmaid. She is so...
Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's! What? Thought we were trying to find stuff.
Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Hey Annabelle.
Oh wow! Okay man, I'm sorry. I did not mean to make you feel bad.
Yeah! You did! And that's why I'm leaving.
Ewww! Ugly Naked Guy is using his new hammock. It's like a Play-Doo Fat Factory.
Feel better now?
Aw, I know all about Kip!
See? That's a great smile! Easy. Natural. Now, pretend I have a camera. You're changing it!
Hi!
Noooo. No-no-no, these babies sell themselves.
Oh, very funny. I don't know if you remember, but my audition was supposed to be Thursday. You got me the audition?! Let's hug it up!
Frankie? What're you talking about?
All right. Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge?
Check it out, Giants-Cowboys.
What about the chick?
I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise.
Yeah.
Thanks Ross.
All right I'll talk in code. Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?
No hey Rach, it's cool okay? Y'know I'm a loner too! Right?
Very funny Ross! Very life-like and funny. Okay. Oh no-no-no, I wasn't waving at you lady. Whoa, maybe I was! Hey, Monica, this totally hot girl in Ross's building is flirting with me.
No, I really have to pee.
Oh yeah. Hey! Should we give these shirts to the girls? Y'know, kinda like a peace offering.
Awww, man! He promised he wouldn't take the chairs!!
Would she? You ate my candy bar!
Ahhh! My ah, my agent said it wasn't a dancing part.
Hey, where are you going?
I've got a science question.
Uh, no, she's at dance class.
Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe it'll take your mind off Janice, and if you don't play, everyone will be mad at you 'cause the teams won't be even. Come on.
All right!
Why not?!
Anybody gonna eat that?
Let's see what else he'll do!
Merry Christmas!
Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!
She's mad because I know today's her laundry day and that means she's wearing her old lady underpants.
Hey, Pheebs?
Hey, Ross! What are you doin'?
All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's great, but...
Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?
Hold on, you-you knew?
No! He blew us off!
Come on! What are you doing?! I'm in character! Would you talk to her!
Yeah you did.
Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual scenarios and stuff huh?!
Hey, I've done plays before. I'm a serious actor.
Uh yeah, right here.
And again, and again, and again... Hello? And again.
Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?
Y'know I don't think you should be talking at all in there! I think you've got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!
I know!
Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry.
That's great! That would be great! Let's do that!
Look, the point is, there's a lot of women out there you haven't even had sex with yet!
Wow! The new Playboy!
You have any idea what this'll do for your sex life?
Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.
Well uh, I don't know about who's here, but I can tell you for damn sure who's not here and that's Rachel!!
Awww! Mel Torme died.
Oh, hey, you guys are finally gonna get to meet Kate!
I don't know.
Hey.
You all right Chandler? Is there something funny about that name?
What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph.
Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.
I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking, "Wow! It's been a long time since I had... 327 + 238 dollars!"
Yeah, in my third drawer on my dresser. You don't want to lose that.
I call Godfather!
What-what are you guys doing here? I thought I told you not to come.
Ahh, the babies miss me?
Uh, I scratched it on the ATM machine down on the corner.
What?
Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy. I never noticed that before.
Two days ago.
Won't-won't that take longer?
It's gonna be worth it. It's a known fact that women love babies, all righ? Women love guys who love babies. It's that whole sensitive thing. Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there. Maybe one of them will break away. No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left. All right, gimme the baby.
Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?!
Yeah, he's just really great to hang around with.
What?
This is it! This is my category.
Okay. Sorry about that... Uh, so where's C.H.E.E.S.E.?
No, no, no!
I think face to face.
Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!
Hi Alex! And uh, as you can see my hands are not in my pants.
All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point.
Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!
What-what is it, what is it?
Yeah-Hey, don't worry, she's a terrific girl. And hey listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I'm not looking for a serious relationship; that'd be great.
Nah.
Ok, look, maybe I should just go.
Yeah! Y'know, she could use a little... Oh nice shot!!!
So you uh, still wondering?
Hmm.
Hey! You wanna go?
Hey babies! Oh, I'm having the best morning. That uh, that Porsche I've got the keys too, still there!
I'll take it back tomorrow.
What's a matter Ross? What you're nervous about your speech?
No! You don't want to wreck it, you don't want to go to fast!
There will come a time in each of your careers when you'll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in the recent, present. And I'm ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now, he's got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me I'm stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you.
So what are you doing bringing her here?! There's people here!
Well, there is one way. His window's open, I say, we poke him.
We did it!!
Yeah. All right, I'll talk to you later.
Hey, who wants to ah, throw the ball around a little, maybe get a little three on three going?
You think?
Come on man, you know I'd do it for you! Because, you're my best friend.
Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!
Come on! Look just-just tell-let her know that you really want them to be there. Let's not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years.
Yeah.
See, this is a great apartment.
What picture?!
Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me.
Well?!
Oh, it was so amazing. After the love making...
What? I don't get it.
All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk. And-and when she comes in hopefully, she won't recognise you because, well, why would she? Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I. You be Mr. Gonzalez, and I'll be uh, Mr. Wong.
I'm sorry, do I know you?
Yeah I guess you're right.
Ross, don't let her drink anymore!
What are you still doin' here?! I told you, lobster ravioli!
Let's get out of here.
I'm doing my scenes with you?
Whoa! Yeah, what the hell is that? What smells so bad?
Hey, this is a little extra somethin' for uh, ya know, always bein' there for me.
I don't know how to play Cups.
I got you something! Open it! Open it!
Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction...
No that's all right. Don't worry about it.
...I'm his
Phew, close one.
But don't you need experience for a job like that?
Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned.
You know it's funny you should mention that 'cause I was thinkin'... what's with the boxes?
Ascot!
Ohh, I know one thing!
Hello New York!
Check the freezer. If there's none in there, then we're probably out. Are you just getting in from work? It's late.
Uhh Pheebs, I heard that. Can you put him on?
I don't want to drive all the way back by myself, I get so lonely. Oh-ooh! How about you come with me?
Girls say it to me all the time! And believe me, if she's anything like me, she's just gonna be relieved.
Well, he's too shy, he doesn't thing he's good enough to dance with girls yet.
No, I don't think so.
Damnit!! Did you move?!
I gotta get the before shot!
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot, or just fall down. That's good too.
Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?
Did she just ask me out on a date?
No, I had sex in high school.
Is he gonna be ok?
What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace!
Oh no! No! No!
Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas....
No more jam?!
Yeah, three days on the lake without a shower. Plus! I fell in that big tub of worms at the bait stand! Hey, how-how's he doing?
I'm sorry! But hey, it's over now, right? Because you can tell them that you know they know and I can go back to knowing absolutely nothing!
Here we go! Here we go! Here we go! How you doin'?
Thank you so much.
Hey no-no-no-no! It's cool! It's cool! I-I'll only be a second, I'm still with my bride's maid, I just-Where are those condoms you brought?
All right, my New Year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar.
I don't know. You uh, you got something for me?
All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough!! Enough! You two go home! I-I-I gotta talk to Janine!
Yeah.
You're right. Maybe I shouldn't even go on the call back.
Yeah! Come on.
Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?
Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!
I'd really prefer a mountain bike.
Well, maybe that's because you're closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.
Okay look, Chandler, if this you have got to listen! You're gonna throw that juice at me, aren't ya?
Why?!
Really? 'Cause I could kinda use the money.
Do we have to know about that?
She's gone. She had a bag and she left.
Yes!
Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.
Why would you need to say hi to them, you've been feeding them for four days?
Hey!
You got me. I don't...
Well, it doesn't matter what I would do.
Hey! I am secure with my masculinity.
Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.
Oh, can you believe they gave Stephanie skin cancer?
Okay.
Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?!
Hey-hey, who's your friend? Hey!!
What?
Look Mon, if you could just call my mom...
When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down!
I can scratch that right off.
All right, well I guess I'll just have to do what I do on dates.
Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!
Oh yeah.
Hey! Who was up from 2 o'clock this morning until 5 o'clock this morning trying to get her back to sleep?
Oh, hey, don't forget your shirt.
I took a shot.
This is where I keep the pizza. And-Hey! Where did the napkin go?!
How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!
I don't know, Chandler is supposed to be passin' 'em around...
Your folks are really that bad, huh?
Look, it's too late, and I got an audition. I can't shop anymore! I...
Listen uh, I'm really sorry, it looks like I'm gonna be stuck here for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the transmission wasn't there!
Ah-ha-ha, you guys owe me big time.
Awww, man! He promised he wouldn't take the chairs!!
You're kidding right?
Ross! They're gonna kill you!
No-hey-no! If you don't want me to do it, I except that. I don't care about that. I just...I don't want you to be upset.
Okay!
All right. But, you're gonna have to tell them.
That's nice.
Anybody want a croan.
OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.
Yeah, you fogged Danny.
Two brothers, one died!
Fine! Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?!
Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?
Porsche.
Yeah?! So's yours!
How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?
Oh, "you do, do you"?
We'll be there.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-I-Hey! I did not go out with your wife! Okay? I went out with her!
You got to go on a ride along?!
Uh-huh. This and a bunch of bubble wrap. And, some of it is not even popped!
Thanks.
How you doin'?
No, I'm performing the ceremony. I'm not wearing a tux.
Well, I've been better. But, I'm all right. So you like her huh?
'Tonight' tonight?
Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.
And now Chandler! We're all gettin' so old! Why are you doing this to us?!
Sure I do! It's a verb! As in, "I behalfin' it!"
That's not a bad idea. Yeah. Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow I'm not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys. Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs.
Hey.
Hey Pheebs! Listen, this wooden box keeps sliding out from under the seat. What-what is it?
Well, we got plenty of space! There-there's still some over there by-by that speaker. Please, just stay!
Argh!
She laughed at you?
Uhh, well I've got an audition down the street and I spilled sauce all over the front of my shirt. You got an extra one?
Oh yeah-yeah. And I got the duck totally trained. Watch this. Stare at the wall. Hardly move. Be white.
Oh, Kath, we should get going. We're going to by hamsters.
I don't want them to move to a Volvo dealership!
Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! I...knew...you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us!
Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!
Just pull on it.
Huh? So whaddya think? Casa de Joey. Huh? I decorated it myself.
That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, "whoa."
Morning!
Like a goalie, right?
Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?
Oooh, the next part's the best, when that dead lady in the bathtub...
What if I smack my head on the concrete?
... It's a fertility study.
Two it is. Ross, how about you?
Nicole Eggert. You'll like her.
I can't take any...
And we don't work hard?
And you don't a little good about donating the money?
Hey.
Oh well, that changes everything! Y'know what Pheebs?
Yeah. I'll uh, I'll call ya.
I don't want to marry Chandler!
Well don't just say.
Well. I guess you think you're pretty special huh? Sittin' up here in your fancy small hall building. Makin' stars jump through hoops for ya, huh? Well y'know what? This is one star who's hoop... This is a star that the hoop-this hoop-I was Dr. Drake Remoray!
Hey!
Sperm or regular?
You know more than one Fun Bobby?
Well, that went well. Yeah.
Not likely. 'Cause you see that body bag right there
Okay, pick a card, any card. All right, now memorize it. Show to everybody. Got it?
Oh, yeah, good idea.
Hey! Hey!!
Well, this has been great!
Whoa.
Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.
Well you gotta kiss someone, you can't kiss your sister.
Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great...
It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A. That'd be cool.... This blows!
Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!
They break your heart, don't they?
Well-well-see? Parents are comin'!
Oh yeah? If you're gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.
Mom, so what did you think?
But it hurt's my Joey's Apple.
Yeah, well, you don't have your racket.
: Ahhh, that's alright. Y'know, that's a tough hand to beat.
Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes. I'm tellin' ya!
He's got the body for it.
Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.
Whoa, that doesn't necessarily mean that he's breaking up with you.
Better?
Oooh.
Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?
Great! I'm finally getting into this sailing stuff.
Maybe you changed?
Look, I got to apologize on the behalf of Carl.
We can't, alright? We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out.
Well, how long do you think it'll be?
You and me, next dance?
I couldn't even if I wanted too.
No-no-no! We gotta go! Come on! Here we go.
That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.
Half the taste is in the smell! You-you're sucking up all the tastiness!
What's this?
Yeah.
Multi-colored robes! Ooh, and maybe a hat.
Yeah! Oh my God! Is this what it's like to be you?
I don't wanna give up the bag. I don't have to give up the bag! Do I Rach? Oh, you think I should give up the bag!
Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a change. This has gone on long enough.
Hey! What's up?
No! No! No! No, I'm not going to punch Chandler.
What up?!
What are you doing? Get back over on your side of the... Hello!! Hi, I'm Joey, we haven't met.
Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports-team!
Oh wow that's a great idea! And I still have his credit card.
You're smoking again?!
What?!
Oh my!
Hey-hey! Stanley! Hey-hey! You're leading man is here! Let's get to work.
I have to pee. And Rachel's in the bathroom!
In a minute!!
Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?
Yeah!
Hey!
Ohh-oh, wasn't he cheating on you with her?
Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.
Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.
Hey.
Okay.
Dad, Ronni's here.
Oh, hey, Monica, we've got a question.
Me?
Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island?
Oh, Richard's here. I should run down say bye to him
I can't believe this Chandler!
Okay.
Yeah-well-yeah! Yeah-oh-yeah. Come on in.
Yeah, can you see me in a place like this?
Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me. Go get me a sweater.
So, you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything?
Ugh. Now if a cow should die of natural causes, I can have one of those right?
We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that I'll be there as soon as I can.
Listen, I know the invitation says 6:00, but does that mean that you want people to get there at six, or the show is gonna start right at six?
Whoa, store will be open tomorrow!
So, we're walking down the street and I turn to you and I say, "Hey, let's go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes," remember? And then, and then, you turn to me and say, "Nah, let's just hang out at your place." Well, that was a nice move dumb ass.
Yeah!
The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up! But I figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they're gonna start to think that I don't own it. So I figured I'll wash it. Right? Monica, you got a bucket and some soap I can borrow?
I was tryin' to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I'm gonna do?
Pheebs!!
Oh, you should here me.
Yeah, big!
Six.
So are guys doing okay?
Well, I like it. Here you go.
No I mean it! I can't believe they would do this to you! And to your fans! I mean they are going to be devastated! Heart broken! They love you so much!
Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second?
Hey!
Huh.
I will sit with you Dr. Geller.
He's back! The peeper's back!
Hey, hey, they're runnin'
Yeah, she tops out at 130.
Is it her fault that some of them didn't make it to you?
Cat.
Oh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay, maybe I'll talk about London! Y'know when you two hooked up! Only, only I won't say hooked up. I'll say, "Began their beautiful journey..."
All right, hold on! Hold on. Hold on. This is Ross, okay? He's our friend. He obviously went crazy. He obviously lost his mind.
Hey.
Hey, all right!
I love that movie.
No-no-no, no it's uh, it's okay.
Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did! See what happens when you break the code?
Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here.
No no, seriously, Chandler and I were just talkin about this. He is so much cooler than our dads. I mean, you know, our dad's are ok, ya know, but Richard is just- ow, ow. What are you kickin me for? Huh? I'm tryin to talk here.
Yeah, my neighbor... Yeah, the brunette... She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress.
Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and...
Hey little buddy, how are you feeling? What the hell is in that face cream? That's so soft. Pillowcases! Zelda looked at the chimney sweep. Her father, the vicar... The vicar? ...wouldn't be home for hours. Her loins were burning. She threw caution to the wind and reached out and grabbed his... Whoa! Whoa-ho-ho-ho! This is a dirty book!
A woman in a man's body.
You and Rachel.
All right!
Hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me?
By someone besides Monica?
Yeah, the other day I was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up. Oh! Which reminds me, I'm also thankful for thongs.
Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?
Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello. He'll know what it means.
Not really.
No, we're alright.
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah! Enh? All right, what do you think?
Oh my.
Listen, you know how uh, when you're wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?
Hey, y'know what? I'll come too. I'm making money now; it's about time I give something back.
The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin' Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn't even get half a cup! Nothin'!!
Then, uh, then I'm sorry.
See, didn't I tell ya these pillows would be a good idea?
Yeah.
Now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya.
Oh, just had a baby.
Well, I didn't realize until I got home. I wasn't gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! Y'know what? I'm gonna go find that guy's car and leave a note on the windshield.
Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more.
Okay.
Oh wait, before you tell me what it is! Okay, what is it?
Oh, I've been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche.
Yeah.
Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
So what if he didn't come! We can still go out and party ourselves!
Come on! Who has the biggest boobs?
Y'know what? I think that's enough for today. Thanks for your help!
Hey, thank you so much.
It's kind of embarrassing, y'know. I mean, I was an actor and now I'm a waiter. It's supposed to go in the other direction.
Come on look guys, don't fight.
And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and, and, and bite her!
Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?
You were right before. I mean, friends are so important.
Yeah, yeah he is.
Yeah?
Who cares?! I-I'll make payments, whatever it takes, I want the Mr. Bowmont!!
Hey! Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!
Oh, I know...
Joey!
Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend zone.
Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour.
Hey, how do you spell suspicious?
Now, don't argue with me...
I couldn't do it.
Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in.
Okay, great!
What the?!
Hey, how much cash do you got in your pocket right now?
Let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat.
Check this out? Huh? Yeah. That's the stuff. What do you think?
Yeah.
Hey!
It's a name, yeah. I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big pool.
"Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!"
Hey, it's me. Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble.
Is that why you bought all this stuff?! Well, y'know what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and there's a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I'm not gonna eat! You know why?!
Why not?
Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!
Yes, it's a highly controversial procedure.
No-no, I don't really have any money. Not yet, anyway...
But this is a two line part, it's like takin' a step backwards. I'm not gonna do this.
Cool.
Yeah, okay.
Hey!
...Yeah?
Wow, that's in like 20 minutes. You'd better get dressed.
Hey!
Are you drunk?
Oh, it was great! Yeah, I-I walked her home, and it was amazing how much we connected, y'know? Then ah, then she passed out, but then she woke up. Yeah? And we stayed up all night talking, and now we're like totally crazy about each other!
All right, so... next time, you take her to your place.
Hey, it's not like it sounds.
Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection. No stability. One day you're Dr. Drake Remoray, the next day you're eating ketchup right out of the bottle.
Both of us?
Yeah!
Hmm that's weird. I don't remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.
Well, it's always nice to meet the fans.
I'm still on the set!
Where the hell have you been?!
Karen.
Yeah, come on, think about it. You're 18, okay, she's 44, when you're 36, she's gonna be 88.
Uh, y'know what, we're having second thoughts about our copying needs. And we'll need a little more time to think about it.
I had the same dream!
If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you.
Ah! Huh?
Ohh, Nothing.
Oh, well we watch it a second time and its Die Hard 2!
Okay.
Did I get it?
What-But you saw the show!
Hey!
Looks good, uh?
Uh, wow, 700.
Oh yeah.
You're getting a cat?
I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know? Maybe a little longer.
Why would he turn off the TV?
Well, the brown one brings out your eyes, but your butt looks great in the blue one.
If it's not you, this is a horrible story.
I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it! Look Ross, if anyone should step aside it should be Ben!
You know, I think I was sixteen.
And deaf!
Yeah!
Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this.
Way to be strong, man!
How's that different? Oh! Yeah!
Yeah, that's what I was afraid of.. Okay, uhh...Look Janine I really want you to feel at home here, but some of this new stuff. It's...too girly.
Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for... Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.
Don't worry, it's out there! I think I just need lunch.
Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break.
Right. Thanks. It's June. I'm outta here.
I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?
Ok, uh, hey Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks game and you had to choose between a friend who smells and one who bruises you who would you pick?
Like-like what?
I don't know why you say that so soon.
I'm comin' out!
Yeah!
It's not my first time.
Umm, okay.
The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybe they wanna sign me!
I'm...happy...for you?
All right, huddle up, right over here.
Boy, that guy's underwear sucks!
Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!
Yeah!
Do what?
Oh, what are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me?
Boy, it was so hard not to laugh, I tell ya. Hey, hey, the place looks great!
I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
Where do you think, Zelda?
Really?! Uhh, what color is it?
Are you going to do it?
Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?
What?!?!
Wow! That's pretty nice. I thought he cut off his ear 'cause he sucked. What else you got in there?
What?
Listen, do you guys think I have a chance with Janine?
No! I'm up for a Soapie!
Yeah, yeah, okay. Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown &#150; I'm trying to win her over, so I was wondering if..
You guys promised you'd be more careful! I mean, come on! The good Joey name is being dragged through the mud here!
I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably should've told you about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg.
Why would I return it? I love this bag!
Listen, uh, I don't know when I'm gonna see you again.
All right relax, look I'll pay you with the money from the acting job I am definitely gonna get thanks to you.
That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?
Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear.
I'm not going anywhere, sweetheart.
Uh, does it hurt?
Oh, I know how we can decide. Phoebe, show him your game!
You know, uh... Chandler got you a gift, too.
Thanks a lot.
Rach, there is a decent place to...
Oh!
What?! He got to do it at your first wedding!
All right! Thanks Pheebs!
Yes! And the table is mine.
Well, either you break it off with Ronni
Exactly.
Hey Mon!
So uh, how you doin'?
That was good beer.
That's 'help' spelled backwards so that the helicopters can read it from the air!
Nope. Man look at this! Ross, I can't believe you said you'd play rugby. I mean look how brutal this is!
Yeah, there's this guy from Chicago who's supposed to be the next Martin Scorcese, all right? But then this guy's right after him. Hello!
Me too! There's a game on Tuesday do you wanna go?
Hey! Are you okay?
Sure you do, it was a gift from me. Oh! And you have these three great kids.
Okay.
You got it.

Yeah.
Yeah, what's up with that Serpico?
Oh-ho, and mine!
Oh great. Hey! Go take off those pants, they look ready!
Hey!
Hey, you're back too!
It's all London, baby! Here we go.
Hey.
Whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra, therefore has the biggest wire.
Ohhh, here it comes.
Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. I'm thinking of getting me one of those.
Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!
Well, let me see.
Oh, I-I think I'm gonna stick with the V, I wanna see how this bad boy turns out.
Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7.
Well that's true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great. My character's catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. It's really sweet and-and tender.
Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.
You don't know!
Ugh.
What?
Yeah, okay.
How come those?
Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!
Dude! How come you took off?
That would be Casey. We're going out tonight.
That guy's still doing that?!
Well, that's really a different question.
Oh sure, right back there.
Come on! Do something!
You wanna see what I got? Okay? I've got a baby Tootsie Roll, a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex, a rock, and an army man. Hey!
Come on man! Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up?
Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big. Which I'm not.
Doesn't seem like it's going to work, I mean...
Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing.
Yeah?
I mean come on you guys! My own TV show? I just don't know if I'm good enough.
Yeah, but sandwich time is right now.
Hey, Rach? Sorry to interrupt but umm, Phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something.
All right, I'm here, let's ahh, get this over with.
I figure my character has kids.
Hey, I was pretty close. Uhh, so bad news. Umm, I can't buy the boat, I don't have any money.
I put it on to scare Chandler!
Well, I guess you're right. Maybe, maybe I'll take her down to the incinerator. It's gonna be so said, and kinda cool. She's heeled!
Oh, I embarrass you?
Okay Rach, that muffin and espresso, $4.50. Ross, double latte, $2.75. Chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25. And Pheebs, herbal tea, $1.25. So, all together that's $12.75.
OK, uh.... listen, there's something I want to talk to you about. The network casting lady...
2,000 bucks is a lot of money. Oh, I wish I had a twin. Where could I find someone who looks exactly like me?
Well, this-this-this was great. Didn't everybody have a great time?
You think I need a new walk?
Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later.
Yeah. And uh, I paid for the other half.
'Cause it's a television show.
Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you.
So then how could you I mean, how could you?!
Come on! When you go away, you-you have to play, it's like a law!
Are you serious?!
How could you do this to me Chandler?! This part could've turned my whole career around!
Oh yeah? Well, you don't know about Hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal.
Hey! We were just sayin', great apartment man.
Nope-op! I insist! You get the wine right?
Is ah, is Chandler around?
All right! Now you go get that beautiful pig! Oink!
What a bad idea!
Picture? What picture?
Uh-huh.
No! No, you smell like a meadow. I'm sorry.
Hey, you're ah, pretty good at this.
What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?
Oh, all blank, and no blank, make's blank a blank blank. Oh no-no-no, no, the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they get away. Aww!
Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. Look, I made an effort to like Janice, now I think it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right?
No-no! No, I'm accepting it on her behalf.
What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?
Yeah, I-I just made up the stuff about the wedding because I didn't want you to worry about me. But, I'm having surgery today.
What?
Well Ross was hangin' out over at our place, Rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from Chandler....
It is.
It made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. Look, there's no unselfish good deeds, sorry.
Yes!
Maybe this should be more of a quiet game.
You want me to lie to Chandler?
Well, I'm doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job as co-host!
Yeah?
Hi!
Mar-klan.
Hey!
I dunno. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even jolly, it's all political.
G-sharp.
Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means?
Well, that went well. Yeah.
I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you.
Uh-huh!
Oh my God, I'm sorry, I'm being so rude. Rachel, would like a soda or something? Because Chandler would run right out and get it.
So?
They can't kill me, I'm Francesca's long lost son.
Really?
Rach! Rach! Listen, I'm gonna kiss you at midnight.
Takes it out of you?
Hi. I'm Joey Tribbiani; I'm here to audition for man.
Oh. Sorry!
Oh-ho, yeah!
Oh, it is.
You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it.
Aww, man, now we won't be bank buddies!
Ok. He kept my dollar.
Well, when it's not right, you know it.
North route!
No! I am not a pervert! Okay? It's just... I just... Kinda...
Ewwwww!
Uhh....
When? Today? Some, not a lot.
Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of sex.
I know. It was so cool when I was up there before. Me and Jim Belushi would just be crackin' up about something... Then I get fired off of Days Of Our Lives and he takes me down. Now he's just laughing at me. Look at him, that smug Belushi bastard, I'll...
Who's birthday party?
Whadja think?
Oh, Urse...
Yes!
Nah, not my game.
Yes, I'm afraid it is. You deserve much better than me Erica. You deserve to be with the real Drake, he's the one you fell in love with. Go to Salem, find him, he's the guy for you.
Yeah, so.
Alright, just one. Wow, you're good at that.
Yeah may-maybe you don't tell anyone about this.
Uh, Entertainment Tonight. Yeah, okay so, good talking to ya and don't come out here. All right.
No I'm not. Why would you say that? That's just mean.
Yes!
Ohh, you know what it is? It's smudgy 'cause they're fax pages. Now when I was on Days of Our Lives as Dr. Drake Remoray, they'd send over the whole script on real paper and everything.
Oh, that's OK. You uh, you had a thing.
Chandler, Heckles was a nut case.
All right.
Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while!
Look it's not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door.
Im sayin I see a difference.
Okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat.
So you're gonna have to do it in the mess!
Hey I-
C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!
Hey, want a beer? WHOA!!!!
Funny one! That's good!
No dude, Ross tore up the tickets!
Ooh, that bad, huh?
Okay, can I-can I make it up to you? Huh? I'm sorry. How about uh, dinner tomorrow night?! I'll pay for myself!
So Pheebs, where are you doing all, your bell ringing?
Yeah!
Maybe we should check the trash chute.
Good morning.
All right, I'll see you in the morning.
Hey.
Oh. That is quite a situation. Uh, do you see any like, powder?
Nooo!
What's going on?
Obviously! So, how do we decide?
I want to do it again.
A little salami.
I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldn't believe me.
Wow! Look at this! He wrote a check for 50,000 dollars to Hugo Ligrens Ring Design. Oh, sorry, what do you think the good news is?
Uh, they're like my best friends. Are you saying we can't hang out with them? 'Cause that would kinda be a problem.
Alright, I can make my peace with the clean dry towels...Also what is with these chips you bought?
Oh, I am going to go for a walk in the rain.
Yeah, whatever you need. Hey, you wanna go home?
Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl.
Thanks sweetheart. Give me a little sugar here. Okay.
Nothing, he's just really believes in that.
Okay, Okay, Fine! Make Jokes, I Don'T Care! This Is A Big Break For Me!
What?!
Who wants French toast?
No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?
So, you saw me on Days Of Our Lives huh? Want me to, want me to do a little Dr. Drake Remoray for ya?
Ross! Get a shot of this. Hey babies! These are the headlines on the day you were born! Okay, now girl baby turn away and boy babies... Check it out, huh?! This is what naked women looked like the month you were born. All right, now let's dive right into the good stuff.
Yeah, but I don't wanna die!
Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I don't think any of them are gonna work out.
Wow! I'm so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much.
Aww, there we go.
They're brother and sister!!!
Yeah, I-I-I'm down with that. Okay, here goes. How you a-doin'? It worked! She's waving me over. Okay, I-I-I'll be right over. Let's see, she's on the third floor...
So you've been sittin' around here all mornin'?
A book? Is it like a book that's also a safe?
That's great. Thanks Rach.
Oh Monica, listen, I ah, I saw down at the hardware store, they got those designer tiles on sale. If you ever want to redo the bathroom floor.
What are we supposed to be seeing here?
Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven't been able to stand up since. But um, I don't think it's anything serious.
Aaron! You gotta let me go. The guy's hammered!
Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to play, we completely understand.
I think it's going okay. Looks like he's smiling.
Is to have a long, long talk. Y'know? Get Joey out on the open road and really open him up.
Yep! Grab a plate.
Oh, dude I'm so sorry!
Ewwwww!
So I guess it's Joey then!
Yeah, we look great together.
After!!
Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey.
Get him a bone, get a bone. You gotta bone?
I told you not to move it! Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted to move you mom, and you said don't, and I did it anyway and her head fell off?
Oh that's great! Oh thank you so much!
Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still get cake right?
Yeah, and I'm a little tired from digging the hole.
Get out of here, really?!
It was unbelievable! I walked in there and she was all over me.
Pheebs!
Done! I did it! Heh, who's stupid now?
How're you doing?
Hello!
Hey, what's up?
Ross has a boyfriend.
Can we please turn this off?
Pathetic mess? I know, butcome on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching! Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this.
No, one man for the rest of my life? I don't know if I can do it! This means I'll never get to sleep with Joey!
Feminine.
No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don't know why you're pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there's a spot open.
Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doin'. I mean, what if we're at her folks' place?
Hi!
Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?
This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.
Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?
Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges.
Yeah, we haven't dropped it in...
That's not funny at all!
Really?
Such as?
Judge rules, Nutter-Butter.
I'm not sure.
Yeah, I didn't know that.
Alan.
Dude, Phoebe's mom has got a huge peni...
Oh hey, no, you're not welcome. Okay, look, I hate this! You guys keep embarrassing me! Yesterday, Rachel found your razor in our bathroom and I didn't know what to say, so I said it was mine and-and that I was playing a woman in a play. And one thing led to another and
I know!
Yeah.
Ahh, forget about it, I'm havin' a ball. How's the apartment doin'
..Naughty!
Because she uh, she-she thinks that you are blah and that you, Monica, are too loud.
All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
Hey, stripper!
I think so.
Oh yeah.
I'm him.
Sure.
Ross?
I just got off the phone with my sister.
What is it?
Yes! I will have the lobster ravioli.
Maybe you'll order a little sangria?
Are you calling you people? Yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal on Santa Clause right?
Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.
Not so much.
Ok, now that your coat is safely in the bedr-, oh, ok we can come back out in the living room.
Damnit Carl!
Chandler!
Unless what?
I call it!!
Geez, look how fat she got.
See, this is why I don't date women who read. Uh-oh.
Here, I brought you some flowers.
All right, don't waste it, I mean its still food.
Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.
Yeah?!
Yep.
Pheebs, who's Evelyn Dermer?
Hey guys!
Hey.
Big fat goalie.
What?! Why?!
Uhh, the ball thing.
Hey.
Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.
Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here!
Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing and it kinda knocked me out a little?
Well I don't like to say it out loud, but, yeah! Don't feel bad man, we all have our strengths. You're better with numbers and stuff.
And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv-
Hey Robert, could you ah, ha, pass me those cookies?
Well, that-that-that's it? You're gonna, you're gonna put it on your self or anything?
Hey, you know what naked card game is never boring?
Feminist issue. That's where I went!
All right well, I'm outta here. Wish me luck.
Yeah! Yeah y'know, like warm up the crowd. Ask 'em where they're from. 'Cause in Joey Tribbiani you get a minister and you get an entertainer. I'm a minis-tainer! There is no one better! There is no one greater!
Yeah but it's too much stuff. You know like, you got the candles and the foofy schmoofer thing here and over here you got a picture of a watering can.
Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?
Peanut butter!
No!
How can they do this to me?
No, no, no, don't say "listen." I know that "listen." I've said that "listen."
Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady.
That you're actually 50?
See, there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office, but I'm still on TV and that's good exposure.
If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so.
Yeah! Me too.
Okay. I went down to the 'Mattress King' showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband.
Oh, I can't believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y'know? And it wouldn't matter. Now I gotta be careful?!
Wow! Uh okay, well uh...
Oh, wait-wait! Maybe it's a pickle?!
Anything I can do? Whatever you need.
How come you have two?
Right, and you go with Rachel, Bonnie's free tonight?
I know! It's stuck!!!
Yes.
Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, I'll let you have her.
Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more-
So, I hear you're single now...
Oh-oh, hey-hey, Kate! Listen I want you to meet everybody. Everybody, this is Kate.
Night, you guys.
Nah, it's okay. Right, Gunther?
"When I think of the love that these two givers and receivers share, I can not help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving and giving and..." And then I can't think of a good word for right here.
The balloon?
I don't know! But he did not eat your face cream!
It's the chick! She's...going through some changes.
Hey listen, why don't you come downstairs with me? There's some really nice girls down there.
What?
Oh! Maybe it's because I'm on television. I'm an actor on Days of Our Lives.
I'm not wrong! I wish I was. I'm sorry. Bet that barium enema doesn't sound so bad now, huh?
Really?
Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!
No-no-no, no, no, wait. You see, I'm an actor, Joey Tribbiani, I'm doing a scene with you today, and well, I stink.
I'm tellin' ya that girl totally winked at me.
Bikini, French cut, thong! And-and the fabrics! You've got cotton, silk, lace! And y'know what I've always wondered about?
Oh no-no-no! No-no-no-no-no-no-no!
Oh-ho-ho, you think I don't know what breaks my fridge? Excuse me! Well what do you know! Broken! That'll be $400!
Uh, Pheebs we kinda need you to drive us all up there in your grandmother's cab, but y'know what, I'll stay.
Joey.
Oh I am!
Hey, Monica bought a bed from the Mattress King?
Yeah, what's that about?
Look, my best friends are getting married in like an hour. Okay? And I'm the minister. Please! Please! Can you pull it together?
I'd seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...
Joseph's good, isn't he?
So I guess you all saw it.
Ohhh!
I don't know.
Mark's a genius!
Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, it's says so in the script! Y'know ah, I-I don't know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that you're a bitch.
I've been trying for two days. When I called the restaurant, they said she was too busy to talk. I can't believe she's blowin' me off.
OK, alright, the people who threw the water.
That's not what she said last night.
Nothing.
Great, you can cover Chandler.
What?! Noooo...
Rach, it's, it's ah, it's not that we don't want to, really. Are we talking models in their underwear?
Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and stuff.
Whoa-whoa, don't we need to do some kinda preparation first? Like ahh, get really drunk?
Can I change a hundred?
Oh umm, not go.
I do. There's uh, let's see, Guy With a Mustache, Smokes-A-Lot Lady, Some Kids I've Seen, and A Red-haired Guy Who Does Not Like To Be Called Rusty.
What?
Hey-hey listen...
Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?!
Okay well that may be true. But, in-in okay, Air Force One the Russians were terrorists! And evil! And plus he kills a bunch of them! That-that-that's offensive to Russians.
Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors!
Somebody was using his head. Hey, let's check out the rest of the place.
I can't believe she would say that too you.
Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...
Phoebe!
Really? I can do it?
OK.
Oh, Oh, you're right! I don't want that. I can't date her!
Great!
Yeah, I uh weighted like 27 pounds when I was born so...
So...What?
Who?
You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this, I owe you one. Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?
Uhh, well, she's...really good in bed.
Yeah, well...
And you never knew she was a lesbian...
I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right?
Yeah! We are!
Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean!
Well, I was Dr. Drake Remoray, Stryker's twin brother. I mean, who looks more me than me right?
I Play Al Pacino's Butt. All Right? He Goes Into The Shower, And Then- I'M His Butt.
But only in the moment. So do ya wanna kiss again?
Yeah!
Hey, y'know you could always visit him.
No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! I'm serious this time! In-in fact, look, there's a-I wanna give you something. And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money. Now, I want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, y'know, thank you for being such a great roommate.
You'd better act surprised.
Yeah.
Look Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born, okay? Now, I have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks! What does that tell ya'?
What's the rush? What?
She's still asleep.
Sure!
Well that's like summer in a bowl.
Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?
Audition? I thought you were gonna offer me the part.
Hello! Oh yeah! It's the apartment manager; Ross put us down as references. Ross is the greatest guy you'll ever meet! Yeah, he's very reliable.
I can't believe what I'm hearing here.
That's because all people are selfish.
Hey!
Well that thing is clearing in the way! All right. Ah-ha! Ah-ah!! Damn fridge!
Hey, hey, hey no.
Yes! Whew!
I'll never get to be a best man!
See you in 2003.
Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!
I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.
Sure, now I'm scared.
Well uh, she didn't want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row. I'm so sorry.
You can't just ignore the bet! It's a bet! You bet and you bet and if you lose, you lose the bet!
Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!
Hey!
Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.
Hey Chandler! Y'know that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?
Yeah we are!
I am so sorry man.
Oh, oh, oh, sorry.
All right, well maybe I'm enjoying it a little bit. I mean I'm getting pretty good at it.
Chandler? A word.
Hair transplant.
Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know....
Uh, I get Leslie out of the coma and then we make out.
For the ride.
Oh no-no, it's uh, it's not what you think. We uh, we used it to, you know, fling water balloons off the roof. Remember that, those junior high kids couldn't even get theirs accross the street.
Sure. Yep.
Hey.
Yeah.
Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I like that!
Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?
Right!
It's okay, these things happen.
Who's seven?
No! No! No! For my new fridge-our new fridge!
Hey, you don't even live here anymore! What are you doing answering my phone? I have my machine!
No, I'm not questioning it, I'm saying it's stupid! What?!
He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.
Wow, it's big!
Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?
Uh yeah, where-where's the guy who decides who's pictures go up on the wall?
Huh.
What?!
Everyday use.
I'm always on the swings! What am I doing wrong?!
Oh. Okay. Hey, can I ride this outside?
Come on Treeger, don't say that. You just ahh, you just need more practice. Here, come on, let's ahh, let's try it again. Come on. Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway. I mean, y'know, I'm not really that comfortable dancing with a- We-he!! Hey!
Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.
Wow! That was good. That was... Tweezers?
There's like-there's like 300 bucks in this one!
Yeah, o-o-o-o-okay anyway, I just wanted to say I'm sorry. Here.
I gotta get one, too.
No!
I bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a VCR in our hotel room... we'd never even have to go outside!
All right, that's it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. But now, forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself.
So, you'd hire me, right?
You?! And-and you?!
Two pizzas?!
Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, 'cause I'm heading up there.
Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial?
Hey.
Well, you know Chandler.
Ok, um, uh, we three feel like, that uh, sometimes you guys don't get that uh, we don't have as much money as you.
Because, I'm not wearing any underwear now.
Emily is kinda taking a long time, huh?
Oh my God!
So where you gettin' it?
What? What?
No it isn't, I ate that.
Sure. Here. I'll uh, save your parking spot.
Will you quit hoggin' it!
Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that you're dancing with.
What happened? What happened?
Hey I was crying because, because nobody believed Quincy's theory. Okay?
What?! What's wrong with my eyes.
No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. It's a one day job, max.
Wait a second, I see what you're trying to do here! You-you're trying to give me money again!
No-no-no-no-no, I saw an ad for this video, people climb that thing everyday! We could totally do that!
Chandler gave me word of the day toilet paper. I'm gonna get some coffee.
Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?
I'm not Drake.
I'm not talking to you! You broke my fridge!
Yes!
I want the drugs Ross, I want the drugs!
Oh. No! No wait, that's weird!
What's goin' on?
Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.
Chandler, will you just come in already?
Yeah, and not put us in the middle.
It's not a cat!
Yeah, it's for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. It's a very important issue in this month's Playboy. I'm sure you all read about it.
Wow, this is wild. What're you gonna get?
Is that the fire alarm?
Oh, it went amazingly well!
Give me $400!
That's okay. Chandler's the one I'm mad at.
But hey, Ross, this place is available now!
It is???
Y'know what I think? I think somebody's got a little crush on Casey. How 'bout I fix you two up? What do you think?
I know! Neither did I!
So what? Look, suppose we were a divorced couple.
You got all that from saline solution?
Awwww!
Okay, pick a card.
Come on Pheebs! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
Shut up!
Can you tell me how this happened?
No! No! No! No! No! How you doin'?! How you doin'-Damnit Carl! Go wait in the hall!
Hey Pheebs!
But I made cards!!
Hey! Terry.
Did you call the cops?
That was one good minute!
Oh yeah, I added three.
What?!
That's not gonna happen. No. Because we have a new deal!
You are dogged man! I totally fit!
Page 42, page 42, page 42.
I can still hear you!
Hello, Zelda.
Stegosaurus!
Okay, hey, museum geeks, party's over. Okay. Wave bye-bye to the nice lady. There you go. Back to your parent's basement. All right. Come on boys, come on out! Here you go. All right.
Yeah.
Woah, hey, yo.
Listen, sorry I didn't stop by last night but I had a date.
No, as part of the audition. See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses.
Of course it was a line!
Hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?
Monica. Oh... huh, I always thought it would be Rachel.
Yeah, you did some real good thinkin' in there.
Oh, thanks, thanks. Bye bye Jeannie.
Get out of the corner. Pass it, pass it.
Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.
So uh, what are you guys doing?
If anything should happen to him...
And?
I don't know, it looks the same.
Yeah! Okay! Hey! Hi!
Hey Jessica.
You forget how many great songs Heart had.
Wouldn't you pay good money to see these identical hands showcased in some type of a uh, entertainment venue?
Oh man!
Hey! How you doin'?
Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?
Hmmm, soup! Hmm soup! Hmm, soup!
Yeah and the most important thing is that it won't be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. It'll be me! And I swear I'll do a really good job. Plus, y'know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.
Well, ah, I'm an actor. I'm fairly neat. I ah, I got my own TV. Oh, and don't worry I'm totally okay with the gay thing.
It's a woman.
Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments, if you know what I mean.
It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.
Eight hundred and twelve bucks.
Is she great or what?
I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone!
Ah, anything we might of heard of?
He paid a lot of money for it.
Oh yeah!
Uhh, hello Miss Buffay. I know where your dog is. I want you to know that he'll be returned to you, almost as good as new, within, within 24 hours. Uh, goodbye.
Hey, now you're the one who wet his pants.
'Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about to-
Bastard!
Morning.
She is so hot!
They gave me the shaft all right.
Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttin' up, eh?
Hey Ross listen Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend!
Hey Pheebs?
Man you are incredible.
Hey! Is uh, is she gonna be all right?
Die Hard!!!!!!
Seven hundred bucks!
Oh! Oh-oh, you gotta pick Joey! I mean, name one famous person named Chandler.
Ah, this is my friend Rachel.
Urse...
Why is 10 the highest?
Uh, 10:30.
Hey, do we do this too much?
Hey!
Weekend at Bernie's.
Hey, what's the horsepower on this thing?
Yeah!!
Hey.
Welcome to America.
Uh, some of her friends, yeah.
Yeah! But if would've know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn't have worried about it so much! See you around!
Yes you are!
Me too, we should get goin'.
Not a dad.
Oh come on. Nobody likes two different kinds of eggs equally. You like one better than the other and I wanna know which.
Why?
Really?
No I didn't.
Why not?
Well look, hey, it's all your fault!
Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?
I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal.
And you'll be nice?
How you doin'? Joey Tribbiani, America.
Yeah!
Whoa! This guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town! Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition!! I mean, way to go Ben! Man! I've been in that park a million times and no one offered me an audition.
Well uh, look Ross I uh, I think Carol's great and I'm sure you're a very attractive man, but I....
Huh?
Hey.
Here you go.
But I was Dr. Drake Remoray. How can I go from bein' a neurosurgeon to drivin' a cab?
Uh-huh, not as high as... It worked! King!
Aww, me too. Now let's finish this and go to bed.
Look, what am I gonna do? I'm not flirting but still, I'm drawing her to me like - like a moth to a flame! What the hell's going on over here?!?!? Monica's gonna kill you! Look I need your help, I have to do something to-to repel this woman! Wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all the time.
Well I uh, got what I came for. I'll uh, I'll see you guys.
Hey!
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Or, or I'm the one who dates her.
Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it.
Okay! When?!
Ross, hey, the band's ready outside for your first dance with Emily, so...
It's almost as if he knew.
Well I didn't tell them!
But what about how much taller he is than me?
Don't worry man, I get to bring a guest. We'll show him.
Yeah!
Interesting.
Y'know what? Make fun all you want. This is a great bag! Okay? And it's as handy as it is becoming. Now, just because you don't understand something, doesn't make it wrong. All right? So from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact that Joey, comes with a bag!
Dark red.
You sick bastards!
He hooked up!! Tell us about her!
Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There's a lot of theories that didn't pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.
All right, let's get me back up there!
Hey, what have you guys been up too?
Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room.
Die Hard 2.
Whoa. Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Yaaahhh. Ahhh, candles. What'dya thinks gonna happen here tonight?
All right, Ross!
Oh! Yeah!
Whoa! Is this porn? What did I do? I must've hit something on the remote.
Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It's like Ross not likin' ice cream.
I know, here-here!!
Um, this?
But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you're work cut out for you. 'Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she's into some other guy. So...
I think you did.
Apparently, there's like a million guys out there that can play Mac, and there's only this one robot and this one guy who controls it! I didn't know he could get me fired! What am I going to do?
Oh thanks. Thanks. It was great meetin' ya. And listen if any of my friends gets married, or have a birthday, or a Tuesday...
What?
Wow, that's, uh, dirty.
Wow! Cool!
I'll take it!
Open the box!!
Yeah, look how that worked out.
Thank you.
Well then tell me things like, 'Joey you'll be fine,' and, 'Hang in there,' and, and, 'Somethin' big's fonna come along, I know it.'
Hey Monica, it's Joey!
Well, I eat a lot of meat right?
Dah!!
I'm just so nervous! Y'know? The callback isn't until tomorrow at five. I feel like my head is going to explode!
Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.
I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I can't, I can't tell you that, it's like the most awful, horrible thing I've ever done my whole life.
Eyes! No, no. Your eyes! No. Chandler's eyes!
But I-I-I can't stay too long, I gotta get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow and I gotta look good. I'm supposed to be playing a 19-year-old. What?
Hey Rach, listen I was thinkin' uh, I'm gonna have an extra room over at my place...
Don't answer that.
Wow! Well, my folks really liked it! So what-what did you guys think? It wasn't that good.
Alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash.
Nope, not that one.
Hey Ross!
I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?
Okay, retract the device, retract the device.
Hey!
Chandler? What're you still doin' here, I though you guys took off.
Uh-huh.
Oh my God.
That's us.
But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right?
No! No, I-I just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents, that was really sweet. They're so happy they get to be a part of your special day.
How could I not get the part? The play was about a 29-year-old Italian actor from Queens.
Which what?
Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?
A monkey.
I have actually not heard of that.
Ah, just one thing umm, is it all right with you if I, if I scream right up until you say action?
Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy.
Blah?!
So are you gonna tell him?
Okay.
We could get that Everest video though.
Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!
Well what is it?!
My mom will.
It's not a cat!
So, system kinda broke down huh?!
That's a good call. Right.
Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!
So when do we get to meet the guy?
Hey!
Eh! There you go.
Hey.
I know. chandler: Now we can finally watch Green Acres the way it was meant to be seen.
Hey! Joey Tribbiani! I'm here! I'm here!
Shhh! This is a museum, no talking. Right down here, we have a large foot. Uhh, and over here we have Ross Geller. Everyone wave 'Hi' to Ross. Ross is one of our most important scientists, look at him, hard at work. Okay, moving right along. Come on.
No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot.
Nice shoes, huh?
If I can't have it you can't have it!
Hey, I didn't stalk her. I mean
What are you talking about? Keep it!
U-N-I-sexy?
Oh my, would you look at that!
Wow! Sure! That's great!
What?!
Services? Oh, services.
"Take could care of your Momma son." "Take could care of your Momma son." "Come on son! Your Momma's good people!"
Wow, look at that. The car is on fire, yet somehow it's expensive paint job is protected by the Miracle Wax.
Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU. Hey, Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?
Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month.
Wheel!
Why God?!! Why?!! We had a deal!! Let the others grow old! Not me!!
Merry Christmas!!
What is Rock 'n' Roll about that?
Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?
What?
All right, I'll take care of it.
I don't know. This little, old lady lives for my career. When they dumped me off of Days of Our Lives she almost died.
Sorry.
Hey!
Oh-oh-oh, yeah! That's right, you take good care of those babies!
Uh, moist, yeah.
Uhh do it?
I still haven't gotten a check for your half yet.
Hey-hey, you're startin' to sound like the butcher's wife there in-in chapter seven.
PBS Telethon.
Hey!
Yeah bye-bye! Hey! So just a light layer?
No. No. No. She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left.
Joey Tribbiani.
Great nap.
You don't say.
Chandler giving you a hard time huh?
Get out! I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me.
What?
What? Were you like in the movie, or... Anyway, she takes off her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve. Very sexy, and classy.
So he likes to break stuff.
I'm Joey. I mean, I'm disgusting. I make low-budget adult films.
I'm coming up!
All right, you're probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it was me, and this is just me, I would ah, I would bow out.
Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.
They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer?
No. No.
I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the place. Y'know, everywhere I look she's like...
What are you talking about? Bitch.
What the hell is that?!!
Hey that's not true! Look at uh, look at Angela Lansb-Angelina Jolie!
All right!!! Okay!! All right! Okay-okay, I gotta get started on my speech! Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have sex right?
Uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-l-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that I, that I came up to you before was because well, I'm really nervous about-about being you. Y'know if you can help me capture the essence of the character. Y'know? Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?
Well no, I'm just in a coma. This must mean I have lines! Oh...
Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming 'cause, 'cause her eyes keep going like this.
I Gotcha!!
Chandler! You are not gonna believe this! I have found my identical hand twin!
Hi!
Umm, well, what else could it be?
A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks.
Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.
Oh my God.
Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I'll grab this one.
Yeah, we're goin' to a Ranger game.
Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout.
Hey.
No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents always lie. You know, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went another way', but this, I can use this. I canna work on a new accent.
I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?
The big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and it's at the perfect angle so you don't get any glare coming of off Stevie.
Yeah. With a bite! Gee-e-e-eez!
Good. Hey.
Why don't you like PBS, Pheebs?
No, that means nothin to me.
Huh.
Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go?
London baby!
Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an audition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather.
Ross! Ross! Ross, listen! Who are you kissing at midnight, huh? Rachel or Phoebe?
All right, uh... Oh hey, you've done this before Ross, well what did you say when you made up your vows?
Hey, I'm not interested in her sweater! It's what's underneath her sweater that counts. And besides, since ah, since when do you care who I'm going out with?
Hey!
What?
Hey!
Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man?
All right.
Yeah?
Ross, did ask us first, and we set that night aside.
Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if I'm the best of the people they see, they give me the part.
Huh, you uh, you always wear panties?
Well, we could do that!
Great!
Heyyy.
Okay!
I'm telling you man, I saw it.
Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.
Uh, boat rope.
Oh, I'm sorry, Ross. I'll get it for you right now. And since I made you wait, I'll toss in a free muffin.
Great! All right, so I'll call you later.
Street noise drowned any of that out? No, all right, I see you later, okay...
With a man?
All right! I'll try! But if I can't, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.
No! No. Don't do that, just next time make sure she really likes me.
Just a, uh... hearing disability.
Okay! All right. Umm, all right Wayne, level with me. Okay? I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired. Okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part! Come on man, you-you got to give me a second chance! I mean, I love-I love this little guy! Ah-ah!! Okay, that's why you didn't want me to touch him right? Here you go! Okay? Stupid! I can't believe it! God! Hey, how you doin'?
What a tool!
Oh uh, can I give you a hand?
Come on man, really how old?!
Well, you must be new here. Why don't we get a table and I'll buy you a drink.
Oh man! They-they just redid my make-up!
Just casually slip it in, y'know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh, I'm a loner-No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn't want to get mixed up with the likes of me.
See?
All right. Hey, but it better make me look really, really good. Oh, and another thing, the video camera? Nice!!
Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! It's like the end of an era! No more J-man and Channie's!!
Hi!
Hey, Monica, wow you've been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.
Go Joe!!!
Consider it done.
You wanna smell him?
All right.
Oh!
Thanks! Okay-okay check it out! Picture? What picture? Eh?
Yeah, you are! I scared you!
Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies.
Kate, do you even like me?
Hey, you guys! Take a look at this! Check this baby out, dug me a hole!
I went back to Riffs. I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered was coffee, she brought me a tuna meltt and four plates of curly fries.
All right well, y'know...I guess we know what we have to do to get down.
Oh. What do you do?
Hey, that coupon expires, you know.
Phoebe! We're both your backup?!
Yeah.
Maybe she never got your message.
Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?
Mine!
Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy. Aramis? Aramis?
Y'know what? I think that's enough for now. Yeah. I don't want to be over rehearsed.
Do you think we'll get our three bucks back?
Oh hi!
Oh, hey Katie! Everyone, this is Katie.
I didn't know that! Well, what a pretty last name!
I don't know! How about, "Thanks for taking the message." Jeez!
Oh.
What?! I don't have 20,000!
No.
Anyway, it wasn't the robot, it was the guy who controls him. Yeah, he doesn't like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E. knock over the sandwich right when I was reaching for one! Ohh!
Huh?!
Oh, ah- the kid has it.
Well, what did you have?
What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me.
Yeah, me too.
Their not breaking up. Chandler and Janice. Their not breaking up. He didn't blink or anything.
Hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant lady glow.
Alright, well, I'm gonna order a pizza.
Don't stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!
Awful! Horrible!
Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?
Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building! If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug. Right. In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.
Uh-oh.
All right-oh! Listen, I know this is your party, but I'd really like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there.
Pheebs, I'm so sorry.
Shut-out!!
Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.
That's right I stepped up! She's my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, I'd pee on anyone of you! Only, uhh, I couldn't. I got the stage fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh, I turned to Chandler.
No, don't be sorry. I don't need it anymore. I found my identical hand twin!
How far'd ya get?
Pheebs?
Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?
She's right y'know.
Yeah, what are ya gonna do?
I ran!!
What?
What they're not invited?! Oh no, that's terrible! They're gonna be crushed!
Yeah! Yeah, I've been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe I would have if these damn boat shoes wouldn't keep flying off!
Hey guys.
Marcel?
Hey, is uh the rest of my candy bar around here?
Judge rules, no violation.
No?
What?!! No I'm not!!
Hi.
Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
Problem solved.
But it's dark out.
Hey!
Kinda, but I've just been having way too much fun.
He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes.
Oh, uh, hey Rach. I uh, I was just coming over here to uh... Oh wait, I don't have to lie to you, you don't live here anymore. Uh, I'm eating their food. What are you doing?
I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars.
You are? Ross, I'm sorry..
What?!
I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.
All right! But, you do it with me once.
Uhh, Pheebs, those are uh, those are Santa pants.
You got it. Okay. Now, I can pass for 19 right?!
Relax Ross, we'll be ready. It only takes us two minutes to get dressed.
Yeah right.
Ooh, I look good.
Oh no-no-no-no, wait-wait-wait!!
Sweepin'. Why? Turn you on?
Yeah!!
Yep, that's my audition.
Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready?
Come on. Come on. Alright, ready, look! Oh... Ross.... you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now.
Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.
Art.
Hey, so where are my parents gonna be?
Wait, here's one. Uh, would you be willing to cook naked?
Here comes the beep, you know what to do.
Wow! Yeah I ah, I gave up a job too.
Hey, you can't say you're breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy.
Yeah!!
All right!
Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. All right? Remember when Ross tried to say, "Butternut squash?" And it came out, "Squatternut buash?"
Why? Is it because I'm friends with Phoebe?
'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
Yeah.
Oh.
I don't know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall, smart blond guys, name like.... Hoyt.
Why are you taking this away from me?
Well, that is a large piece of television equipment. And uh that is an old man! Hey old man!
Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie!
Yeah, hey hey, Happy Thanksgiving everybody!
When do you think we lost her?
Isn't there any way you can keep him?
I like it.
Thirty seconds left on the timer!
You're not gonna like it.
Wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of being my agent.
You wanna see her again, right?
Hey, you guys!
Yeah, I can dance, y'know.
Y'know-y'know what I really want?
Yeah.
And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.
Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking.
Y'know, I'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad boys.
Fight's over!
Do you want me to learn?!
Stop callin'!!
Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did? I'll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000! And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!
Yeah, life's pretty great isn't it?
Hey!
Hey!
Hey now!
No, that's VH-1. I gotta tell you, the music these kids listen to today . . . It's like a lotta noise to me. I don't know...
It's got 'em!
It's not that far! Just drop!
Great!
Oh, great! Can you believe I found it on the second floor?
Maybe she killed him?
How could you lose him?
So I can do it?
Uhhh, mine too! Yeah.
Oh, well I'm uh...
That's fine. I'll just have a Tic-Tac to hold me over.
Mornin' Pheebs. Well, my movie has officially been canceled.
Yeah, right.
So Pheebs what's this guy like?
Alright, now you say something.
Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?! I wanna sit in my chair!
Okay! All right!
Yeah that'd be great! Thanks Pheebs!
Sure! Why not?
Hey, what's up?
Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot.
But then you left.
Okay, what else?
Yeah, she's been out there for twenty minutes, I'm surprised you didn't hear her on the way over.
What's ready?
Hi uh, I'm Joey Tribbiani and with all do respect I'd like to donate some fluids.
What is the big deal?
Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
Yeah, the Knicks rule all!
Argh-argh!! Ooh, soft. Is this mink?
Okay, here's my big scene. My big scene's here! Oh my God.
That's how they do pants! First they go up one side, they move it over, then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?
There's my scene, there's my scene. "Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon. I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..."
Chandler, Chandler, y'know what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses.
Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there!
All right!
Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or- That's fine, yeah...
Look, Ross look, I'm on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that's gonna get you in trouble.
No-no-no, that-that's me, that's me.
Naa, you're just sayin' that 'cause you're in love with Yasmine Blepe.
Well to tell you the truth, they uh, they had a problem with the bag!
Kristen?
Hey!
Chandler, come on nothing even happened!
Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, that's why I let people watch.
What?!
C'mon, Ross!
What?
Let's go watch it at your place.
Oh uh, one of the writers.
Man, I'm starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! "Do you want soup or salad?" Both! Always order both!
Good for you!
Wow! Well, uh... Hey! I'm really happy for you guys! Congratulations! See you later.
Yeah, we'll call that Plan B. All right?
Yeah. Hey, I hope Ross didn't think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!
Yeah, in a poem maybe.
Now you're thinking you gotta sleep with him.
Like you wouldn't believe. Wow! This is a great place.
Thanks.
Yeah, yeah, and then Adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his waist.
I got it.
No-no-no-no-no! It's a surprise, but it's gonna be tricky thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.
Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.
All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I'm gonna go see my agent.
Oh, uh, ok. Right this way. All the other pregnant women seem to be goin' in here.
Say what?
I like that! Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em!
Thanks. Congratulations on your big break.
Yeah, and she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.
Hello.
Shut up!
Hey.
There you go! Keep going. Keep going!
All right! Now hey, I need to use the bathroom. Since I don't need any assistance in there, take a break!
Oh, they cut me out of the show.
Thanks.
Hey!
Uh-oh, shht! The Misses.
That-that is a good trick.
Woah. Why do you get to keep the table?
Ooh!
Oh yeah, sorry about that. Mob mentality or whatever, I don't know...
I don't want to, I'm scared.
And-and-and-and-and the toothpicks?
Well, it's not a part, no. I'm teaching acting for soap operas down at the Learning Extension.
What? Mine aren't tinted.
H-h-h-how's the duck?
That makes more sense.
Not me.
You're right, I'm sorry. You're right.
Y'know, when we talked about face to face, I don't think we thought it all the way through.
Hey, don't start judging me! Huh? You're the one who's in love with her assistant! Huh? And you, you're the one having the affair with the guy who keeps the pigeons on the roof!
Alright, no peeking. No peeking, no peeking, no peeking.
Get your non-believer ass outta my chair!
No!
Oh, that's, that's ah, one of the old ones, he's just taking it to the back.
If you want some privacy you can use my hole.
Is that your card?
Hey.
Yeah, I got too excited!
Yeah, all of us! All day!
Yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker.
Naa, you keep it, you need the practice.
What?
Well Ahh, yeah! Yeah, sure, a drink sounds great.
All right! So, was it amazing?
All right, all right, all right. I mean I'll have to check with him first, but I'll think he'll be cool with it.
I know.
Who?
Oh. Then, no.
Well, since you ask. They want me back on Days of Our Lives!
Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one. Here you go. Y'know I gotta tell ya, sometimes I just-I don't get Chandler. Y'know, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you don't get all upset.
Oh, well great.
Well, I-I might've said supergay.
Delicious.
Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??
Hey, this isn't about juice anymore, alright man.
No, in Ross's building! She's back! She's back! Okay, wait there, I'll be over in a second. Got it!
Oh, yoii. What was that for?
I went.
You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.
Well we'll see!
When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is.
Hey...
Yeah, but it's my wax.
Okay wait-wait p-please be cool! Okay? I work with this woman.
Ooh!
Fan out! Fan out!
Ooh, sorry. Sorry. You finish, go.
Don't blame me, I saw it on The Discovery Channel.
Look, you wanna use our place?
Yeah, all right. Ooh!
Hey.
No.
Oh! Yeah, look there's this play all right? And I'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse. So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.
Ha-ha. Are all you processors dorks?
Wow.
Oh! I know how you can get him, take off your bra.
Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is really stupid.
Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.
Oh-oh!
Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too.
Richard told Monica he wants to marry her!
Really?!
Hey, how was your chef thing?
Cage closed?
No.
I'm in it.
Dad, dad.
No! I'm putting that in my room.
Luck!
Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?
Uh listen, here's your Soapie. I accepted it for ya.
Y'know, I'm beginning to see what Jake was talking about.
Many are scheduled to appear.
Hey.
Vomiting stories are funny...
Okay that's fair.
Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it.
Friends first? That's interesting.
Unless you wanna practice the Foxtrot again? Or-or the Tango?
Okay.
Hey.
Yeah! Okay. Phoebe, you look, I can't.
Good, and hey! My treat. But that's only because you're not eating anything, right?
No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!
Our place, the hall! I...
Hey! I got great news!
Oh. Oh.
Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now.
No, smile! Not that face, smile! Everybody smile!
You okay man?
Oh Rachel look, don't say that, I think you just need a hug from Joey. Come on. Come on. She's back! Hot girl's back!
Yeah, this slow roasted salmon, just how slow are we talkin' here?
Yeah okay. Even though my tax dollars paid for this car.
Yeah baby!
Damn! I am good at Cups!
You mean how they're friends and nothing more?
Well maybe we just take that one away.
Yeah, they're mine.
Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?
So, so how did it happen?
And that's every month?
Why are you doing this?
So what're you going to do?
It-it doesn't?
And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.
Oh yeah yeah. I process. People want the processing, I'm the one they call.
Ooh, we could end up with nothing.
No. No, Kathy.
I don't know, she's, uh.... she's pretty great.
Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What about Rachel?
...I d'know.
Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missed my chance.
All that stuff you just said? I want that!
What? No! No Ross! No-no! Stop! I'm not jumping! Okay, look I have an audition tomorrow and I can't go if I break my leg.
Put your hands together.
Sorry.
Hi!
Oh, what did I say?
Or not. Uh, Rach, why don't you just move in with me?
Ooh, I like that.
You got that from what I said?!
Ya know, one of these times you're gonna really be naked and we're not gonna come over.
Well, there's really only one thing you can do.
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Says who? Your mom?
Yeah, the ah, trees that don't fulfil their Christmas destiny are thrown in the chipper.
She's right in there.
Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she is, but at least with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out.
Cool.
Uh, I think he's in Rachel's room. See ya.
What?! That's not fair! It's not my fault! I was off with my bride's maid! And who's to say I would've even said yes?! I mean I would've said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a deal out of this, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!
Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?
Erin.
Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.
I'm sorry, I just...I like things the way they are.
Come here.
Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!
Yeah
Would you let it go Ross. It was just a dream. It doesn't mean...
You play hard to get.
She's comin'.
Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else.
Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is she cute?
Wow!
Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want.
How'd you get over that teacher?
What's the matter with you?!
Hey well, you can't teach someone to be good with women. Y'know, that's why I never had any luck with Chandler.
Right-right up here.
Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!
Thanks for telling me!
Damnit!
Olive loaf and ham spread, no mayo.
So we are going on two?
How's that going?
You got all that from the back of her head?
Heh, what d'ya say?
Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.
Come on baby, don't go. Please? What do you say?
Yeah, my uncle Sal has a really big tongue.
So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that's nice!
All right, it's another commercial; I still haven't told her!
Yeah, I got my speech!
Your different here too. Your mean in England.
Come here, check this out!
Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good.
Oh no this is devastating! My faith is shaken. I'm so glad I have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life.
Come on, Chandler, Ross is our friend. He needs us right now, so why don't you be a grown up and come and watch some TV in the fort!
Great! Hey! All right! Well-well what is it?!
Yeah! Yeah! Right down there. Hey listen; let me give you a little tip. Do not take a nap on this stoop or you can wake up with your shoes gone.
Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?
Pheebs! You're blocking the porn! Look out!
What are you doing?
Yeah, yeah, I met this woman.
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk.
Yeah-yeah, I'm one of the cops that won't work with you 'cause you a lose cannon. Anyway, look, I'm really sorry, but I stink!
How'd it go?
I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean, let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General.
Don't answer that.
Hey Chandler!
Uhh, hey. Where's the other guy?
Oh yeah, yeah.
I know.
Hi.
Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel.
Alright, alright. Woah, someone's flossing.
Ahh Pheebs, you know you're still my number one girl.
But that's what...
No-no-no-no-no, it's-it's uh, you just uh, uh reminded me that uh, I need to do my stretches too.
Dude!
Yeah, I know exactly what she's goin' through.
Well sure, you name a kid that, what do you expect them to grow up to be?
Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.
Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to be. Yeah.
So I ah, talked to Lauren, kinda told her how things were with us. Did you ah, did you talk to Marshall?
Great story! But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea... Oh man,
Yeah, yeah sure, goodnight.
No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than the first time we went out. Y'know? That was so awkward, we were really nervous.
Right. Goodbye Erica, good luck in Salem. Take care
Nothing!
Wow! Well then I'll just have to carry you.
Oh yeah, that's right!
Nope.
We can't watch that! I mean that's Phoebe!
Uh Rach, if you're gonna start another story, at least let me finish mine.
Yeah!!
Okay! Here we go. Pillow.
That's right!
What, so I gotta shut it down now?
I don't know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.
The what?
Well, that's gonna be tough Mon. I mean it's hard for me to be around an attractive woman and not flirt.
I know! I know! And I'm going to talk to them about it. They mean so much to me. They... They're like my family. If you guys are gonna be fighting all the time, I-I... I don't think we can be together. It just, it just can't work. It can't. I'm very upset.
Hey, here you go.
Yeah you do!
Hey!
You may not kiss the bride. So, I guess by the powers vested in my by the state of New York and the Internet guys, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh wait! Do you take each other?
Hey!!
Oh yeah? If I can't, I'll knock five bucks off the price off the unit.
Well, well that one has ducks on his t-shirt, and this one has clowns. And Ben was definitely wearing ducks.
Just being friendly.
I wanted to go to the strip club!
Okay... Well maybe now I'm not okay with it not being okay.
Do you want me to want you to care?
Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?
Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two.
No, never done that either.
Come on Rach! Look, turning thirty is not that big a deal.
Hi!
You don't drink.
Well, then it wouldn't be a secret. So yeah, that would be okay. Yeah. Yeah!
I can't believe it's Christmas already. Ya know, I mean, one day your eatin' turkey, the next thing ya know, your lords are a-leapin' and you geese are a-layin'.
Aww that's nice. Family should be there, huh? This is her wedding, happiest day of her life.
Are you naked in there?
Nope.
Nah, you're not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney.
No! If anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica! Yeah. Yeah. She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London!
Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!
Yeah.
Hey.
Well, back to square one.
Okay, all right, this is how it's going to work. We're gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest.
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you had that whole Rachel thing.
Only if you think it's better than this... snow-in-a-can!! I got it at work. Mon, you want me to decorate the window, give it a kind of Christmas lookie.
We're the guys.
She really said that?
Okay.
Hey, is, is, is Chandler here?
Ross, you need some help?
It's just I can't because my manager said I... "Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear Annie...
In the woods. No wait-wait, that's the joke answer.
Um-hmm.
Hey!
But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!
Sure! But hey, you know this way sounds good too.
Well yeah, don't-don't you think it's a she?
Guess what?
Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left.
Hello?
Hey.
Whoa-whoa-whoa. Jokes? You guys know they have naked chicks in there, right?
Uhh, Chandler's not here.
I like that! Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em!
All right, and over there is Brady's Pub where I like to unwind after a long day of surgeoning.
Oh no, I'll be done by then.
Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.
No! Forget her, man! You don't need her, you don't need that!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'? This is a poker game. You can't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz...
Yeah, she's been in there all day , uh high fever, a nose problem... Phlegm! Phlegm! Phlegm-phlegm-phlegm!
Ooooohh!
Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do. . . so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, you know that's bad fo r the paper tray.
Maybe he found you flip-flop.
No.
Yes! Yes!! And every time you look at it, I want you to remember that you are a good person. Okay, you've had the chance to cheat, and with me, but you didn't. And that's what this ring stands for.
Tongue?
No. No, I'm Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-I'm the guy in the coma!
Heard about the leg burnin' huh?
Erin! Still here!
Oh, is today the day you're gonna tell them about you two?
Yeah.
You said I had to give you the chair, you didn't say anything about the cushions.
It'll be great for next weekend.
Hey, look who's up.
No you can't do that, where would the chick and the duck live?
Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!
Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday. Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong. Oh, okay, one of you girls come over here and kiss me.
No, it's okay, but if I'm Marge, my breasts are coming out my back.
Oh, well no problem there.
You should see the treatment I get when I'm with that car! People are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments.
Sure.
Oh, it's great! It's a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips.
I'm telling ya, you guys are totally getting back together!
Oh, no thanks, I got it. No I don't!
Hi-hi, I'm Joey.
No! No! No Pheebs, I'm not gonna yell at you. I just y'know, started thinking about you and David and I...remember how bummed you were the first time he left. And I just... Oh Pheebs, come here. Are you okay?
Sounds great! Okay all right, well where does this go?
Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne. Bijan for men? Bijan for men?!
Good luck. And I'm still right!
I can't write! Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know? I can't do it.
Now he's movin'? Man, what is Emily doing to him? Ow!! He's not even here!!!
I'll treat you real nice.
But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea Stadium.
Oh dear God!
Okay! Okay, you're yelling again! See that?
Oh that's on the house courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.
I'd say, come again. No-no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this one, uh...
I don't get it! It was in my room all night! And if she didn't take it, and I didn't take it; and you didn't take it, then who did? Shh! We're trying to think!
Oh, come on! Have you seen what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he dials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!
A date?! No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldn't schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!
Hey, whaddya wanna do for dinner?
That's right Ross, I can see you in your new apartment! And you can see me! Same as yesterday, same as the day before.
And there you go!
Hey Monica, what's on this video tape?
All the time!
Yeah! You don't like Kathy.
Hey! Are those crab cakes? Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?
Well, you know that guy that's on my show that's in a coma? He's havin' a brunch.
Hey everybody, look who's here! You remember my grandmother!
Oh, here I am, here's my big scene!
Yeah, yeah, and the Indians taught the Pilgrims what it meant to be hot in the new world!
No!
He's planning your birthday party.
What you-don't hold it like that! You're lettin' all the good stuff fall out.
No. What?
Aw! Look at that, every inch of this stuff is glued down. It'd take forever to pry this up. You should ah, you should just leave it.
That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?
This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.
Oh, nothing, no. It's an acting exercise, I'm practising my fake laugh.
Sounds good.
Phoebe's a porn star!
Yeah.
Look, it was a job all right?
Uhh, rub it?
Hey!!
Yeah!
Yes!
Whoa. That was really good.
All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king.
You got a little bored?
Hey.
What?!
Yeah.
Ahh!
Hey, I'm gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to do it! He'd even make the girl pancakes! Plus, he'd make extras and leave 'em for me.
Yeah, what's that like?
Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it. I was just going to get dressed.
Hey.
Oh yeah, no problem.
I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her...
You wanna make it 6?!
Oh what, wait, wait a second, I mean, what are we doing? Who's going with who?
People, people, people.
I didn't get it.
Uhh, they're tall.
It's better! You can't go to a museum in your underwear!
Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!
Hey Phoebs.
Oh-ho-kay, I'm talking to the king.
All right, I have one question. What is the deal with this?
No-no-no, please-please Chandler I-I-I would owe you so much!
Nope.
Ross, did you really read all these baby books?
I just got this really weird message from Ross. He said turn on MTV.
What do you got there?
Uh, hang out?! How long?
Sure! What's up?
I hate Pottery Barn too. They kicked me out of there just because I sat on a bed!
Just okay-Did you do it right?!
Are you ok, Ross?
Likewise. Uh, I'll take that. It's what I came for. So, this is new. Where'd you two meet?
Cool!!
I know! Yeah, but, look I can handle it. All right? Look, I can listen to the radio, huh? And Ross gave me this great book .
And what?! Did you sleep with her?!
Oh yeah!
Y'know, we don't have to imagine.
Right over there! Right there! Look-look-look!
Hey, this is ridiculous. I'll tell you what. After I get back from my neice's christening, I'll go down to the coffee house with you and we'll all have a nice cup of coffee alright. No problem, Joey's there.
No! Year! Happy No Year!
Oh my God! You're pregnant!
I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.
Whoa-whoa, what's the matter?! Talk to the captain!
There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? All right who's first? Huh? Ross?
Sure! It flushes it.
Hey Pheebs, I'm so sorry.
I know! I know! Come on, please-please you guys, don't-don't be mad. I'm sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends! Y'know? And it was our first date! Plus, she's really sick!
You do, thanks.
Oh, and how is Allison?
Chandler! I don't need luck. I have thought this through!
Suck-fest.
Well, it looks like it wasn't heeled after all! Yeah! So, I guess this chair is mine now!
Um, sure! Did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way?
Heh, heh. It was nothin'.
Thanks. Yeah, I figure if I wear these in my scenes at least I won't get spit in the eyes, y'know?
Yeah, we set up a court in your room. Uh, you didn't really like that grey lamp, did you?
Dan just moved in downstairs. Yeah, he just got back from like this four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella.
Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.
No, no, no! It's real! And it has been since 1998. Hey Rach! Rach! I'm up for a Soapie!
Vulva?
I might know something.
Finally!
Done.
Oh. Well good! For me. What is this? Did you give yourself a facial?
Y'know what else makes you wonder?
What is that?
Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler.
Hey! What's up?
Look listen, that TV movie I went in for? Did you hear anything? I think I got a shot at it.
Ah-ah-ah Mr. Smartie Pants, it's just not my character that's not brain dead. Hey, so Pheebs, we still on for tonight?
Anyway, I started working on what I'm going to say for the ceremony, do you wanna hear it?
I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you! I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Yeah that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if were ever to have kids, well that's a...
Hey! That's the day after I stop menstruating! This isn't mine.
Oh, you weren't finished?
I can't hear a word you're saying, my ears are ringing so bad.
So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?
You've got to pick a pocket or two. Boyyyyssss, you've got to pick a pocket or two..........
Uhh, 11!
Sorry about that. Thanks for waitin'.
....Are we still talking about sex?
I don't know, maybe we weren't ready to have a chick.
What's the matter?!
Oh, yeah. He's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head.
Yeah, well, it feels different.
Man, I got this close to him and Monica kneed me in the back. What's going on?
I told ya.
No-no, it's uh, it's Heston.
Sh-shh-shh!
Thank God!
Has it been that long?!
....yeah... what else?
You see this, this is a friend.
Okay, I got it! This place makes the best sandwich in the world!
All right, who got Chandler? 'Cause I uh, need to trade.
Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?
Uh, we might be leaving now.
All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn't find out some other way. Did you think about the trail?
Hey dude, it's me.
It's a rented tux. Okay. I'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues.
Fine.
Why not?!
That'll be $3.85.
Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right? So, I'm in my map and-and... Hey!
See, I actually can pour milk, but I got you believing that I couldn't. Now, see, that's acting.
Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?
Yeah-yeah, I noticed that! Is that 'cause she's so passionate?
Hey! What's going on?
It's creamier.
Yeah but I didn't read anything.
Okay, it's a typical New York City apartment. Two girls are just hanging out.
Oh, but when Phoebe has a problem, everyone's all ears!
Yes, all right? All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there and they're gonna be, be drinkin' and dancin, and we really wanna go!
Hit me!
Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.
Hi, Lauren.
Althea!
Freaky.
Yeah! Well, now that you brought it up, our fridge is broken. We have to get a new one. Now, I checked around and your half is $400. Thanks a lot.
No.
They're so small!
Yeah! I'm fine! Thanks! Hey Rach, how you doin'?
Well, I think it's ridiculous that you haven't had sex in three and a half months.
You're a dancer? She-she's a dancer!
Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around?
I got time.
I got that! I forgive ya! Don't come out here!
Yeah.
Awwwww!! Awwwwwww!!!
Nooo.
How was your conference?
I totally don't know what you're talking about.
Oh! Maybe they'll name yours after you! Y'know, they'll call it, The Ross. And then people would be like, "Awww, he's got a Ross."
So you ah, ready for our last practice?
They uh director. Uhh, her. All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work here.
I'll kick that door in if you give me a little sugar.
I called the sperm bank today, they haven't sold a single unit of Tribianni. Nobody wants my product. I mean, I-I-I don't get it Maybe if they met me in person.
Hey!
Okay. Okay.
Yeah, I saw her this morning walkin' it by the park.
Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?
An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I'm getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me...
Come on you guys, come on please-please just give her another chance, huh? She'll come around I promise.
Wow! You guys seem to be having a good time.
Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.
Whoa! For a rich guy he's got, that's a pretty small TV.
I know, it was the best I could get out of them.
Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.
Excellent, I'll be there.
Hey Rach! Hey, you mind if I read my comic books in here?
Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?
Not a problem.
Hey, best man number two, Joey Tribbiani. Now I'm not good with the jokes like Chandler here. Boy...but ahh, I just want to say congratulation to the happy couple. I first met Ross in this coffee house back home...Home...New York City...Where everybody knows my name. Well anyway, I love you guys. But not as much as I love America. Could we please..go home now?
Look, you guys have been to every play I've ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?
Yeah, where the hell is he?
You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel.
Excellent! Okay umm, doggy.
R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?! And-and Chandler's tellin' ya how much he hates marriage?!
Ohh yeah.
Are they? I didn't know I cared that much.
I mean, the job's easy and the money's good, you know? I guess I'm going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? I just feel kind of weird serving you guys.
Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good idea?
Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over, gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!
Dude, you're not even man enough to order the channel that carries the sport.
Anyone mind if I save this?
Oh, I'm sorry. You wanna bite?
This is Janice.
Can't help you, I'm not wearing any.
Uh, well, kinda yeah. Like, remember last week when Alex was in the accident? Well the line in the script was, 'If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to die.' But I made it, ' If this woman doesn't get to a hospital, she's not gonna live.'
You got it.
It's the big night! We wanted to wish you good luck!
Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.
No, not that one. We're trying to figure out who to bring to the Knicks game tonight, we have an extra ticket.
What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail. Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.
Yeah, the stripper stole it.
She's not even cold yet!
Okay, here we go. Ready?
Yeah really, Ross, have you ever been beaten up before?
I've never slept with someone for a part.
All right! You can have the chair.
Well, anyway, I got to go change, I'm ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks.
Yeah. What time are you meeting her?
I may have to, I hate to do it, but I'm the star! Y'know? There's a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor. Excuse me. Joey Tribbiani.
Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so.
Well, I can't use these forever. I mean, let's face it, they're no friend to the environment.
Hey no problem.
Oooh, what you got there?
See look, women, carrying the bag. But it is odd how a women's purse looks good on me, a man.
So that if we went out on a date, shed be there.
Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.
Do you believe in ghosts, yes or no?
Right, yeah. OK. Um, take care.
I'm sorry Dutch, I didn't get that last little bit.
Half hour.
Hi!
What-what-what is so funny?
Oh-whoa-wait, Gunther don't-don't forget your shirt.
Hey.
Look, we were way out of line, we totally support you.
No I just uh, thought you liked your eggs with the bread with the hole in the middle, a-la me.
Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right?
Yeah.
Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.
I slept with Monica.
Then you hold on to it!!
Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off!
Okay, everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill my grandmother if she finds out.
Hey.
Hey there you are!
Hey-hey, check it out! Check it out! Ugly Naked Guy has a naked friend!
I didn't know it was an auction!
Oh, I chose not to hear that.
You call that delicious?
Well, it turns out you were right C.H.E.E.S.E.
What?! Are you kidding?!
Hey, Bonnie had sex there!
Hey, so how'd it go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart?
Aww man! I can't believe I locked myself out again!
The Ross-Is that back?!!
Wait! Terry! Please! Look, I just lost my other job. Okay? You have no idea how much I need this. Please, help me out, for old times sake.
Ah, I'm-I'm walking down the aisle...Still walking. I'm about to pass the bridesmaid I hooked up with last night. Hey! I told her "Hey." And now I'm at the front with Ross. It's Phoebe. He looks pretty mad. Uh...I'd better go.
And I ah, borrowed some of your cologne. I hope she likes it.
No, no, you can't, you can't, okay, you can't, you can't buy her pearls, you just can't, you can't, you can't.
Don't you ah, don't you wanna ask me any questions?
Yeah-yeah, I told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with your head in the toilet.
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! None of that, not while you're living under my roof!
Y'know what?
Hey!
Mma, Mma, Mmaah
Oh, y'know what? Since I'm here, I think I'm gonna have me a little beer on the port side.
Thanks! I've been working out. Hey listen, is it obvious that I'm wearing six sweaters?
Hey, look, I don't need you getting all judgemental and condescending and pedantic.
Are you sure?
Nooo, I said we needed a new plan.
Oh sure, go with the sissy.
If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you've got nothing pushing you to get another one. You need the fear.
Hey, what happened to your fancy chef's jacket?
Okay, great.
Hey, you guys! Look what I found in the giiiiiiift shop. Get up! Get up! Get up!
It's not what you said. It's the way you said it....Oh My God, I'm a woman!!!
Ten, ten.., nine, nine, nine...., eight, eight, eight... Okay, Blast off!
No, look.
They know you know.
Shhh! Man, you made me lose it!
IN LONDON!!!
Sure I can, standard shotgun rules, I'm sight of the room and I called it.
Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me.
So, I guess this is it.
Yeah, I'm ready.
Yeah-yeah-yeah, and they had that beer! That uh...
Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome.
Yeah.
Okay, good, good, good, 'cause, good, 'cause I was kinda having second thoughts too.
I'm listening.
Hmm, noodle soup.
"Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."
He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew! You think we could get a bathtub in our kitchen?
Those two only had each other!
Oh, yeah, with the mug painting. Yeah. I was so listening to that. But ah, y'know what, I think I kinda need to work on my stuff tonight.
Yeah. You know why? 'Cause you came to me first.
Emily is kinda taking a long time, huh?
Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.
That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career we're talking about here!
Damnit, I'm a doctor, I'm not God.
Oh well, they're killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body.
I'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets!
No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. Hey, Angela.
The green bottle next to the shaving cream.
Hey!
I know it doesn't make much sense...
Five years.
Ross? You okay?
Look at this, how did I spend so much money?
Thank you.
Yeah!! I call that London style.
Come on C.H.E.E.S.E., I'm not leaving without you! Try routing your backup source through your primary CPU.
One.
Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my 'Days of Our Lives' on here. You know, juice this puppy up a little.
I can't believe I'm going to lose this job!
But you're spittin' all over me man!
I have an audition, but I'll definitely hook up with you later. Where are you gonna be around noon?
What?
It may not be a bed of roses.
C'Mon, You Guys. This Is A Real Movie, And Al Pacino's In It, And That's Big!
Oh yeah, I definitely know her.
We'll do it all, and better! Look, after tonight, Gandolf will want to party with us, dude! Come on!
Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars.
Oh, he was this cab driver we had in London.
Okay. Hey uh, when do I get to meet the robot?
Ahh.
Here you go. Let me ask you a question.
An annulment? Ross! I don't think surgery's the answer here.
Hey!
Hey, hey.
At least I care about his feelings!
She didn't have a birthday while we were going out.
Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that and that he'd better come up here and apologize. I'll see you later.
Okay, bye-bye.
I think I'm gonna cry!
They didn't fight a lot?
Hey! Dude, some guy just called for you.
Well, Chandler's old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we have, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone.
But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.
All right, I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You see Rach I'm an actor...
Really?! Well, when?
What?
Well, where was I?
Well, we have to say something! We have to get it out! It's eating me alive!! Monica got stung by a jellyfish.
Yeah, that was real.
Done with the bookcase!
You're driving me crazy with that!
No! No, I quit a long time ago. Did I forget to you that one? I'm sorry.
Lifeguards.
All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.
Uh, okay, Pheebs?
Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too.
No it isn't! No, it's not. Because you can also explain it with the truth!
Yeah, Rach, I think you're handling that really well.
Hey, uhh, I need to talk to you.
Mary-Angela.
I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!
No-no-no-no-no, I'm not fallin' for that again.
I did do it, I'm a professional.
So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again?" Of course!
Hold on. Hold on. Rachel coming. Do...Something.
I know, Monica told me.
Come on!!
You got porn!
Ok.
Okay...
Thanks.
Hey, Monica, who would yours be?
You want to see her again, right?
Oh my god.
Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!
I was tired!
A little uh, good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure, now that's the kind of math Joey likes to do!
Oh, man, I could totally get that part. 'I'm sorry, that seat is taken.'
Oh, yeah, I do.
Why would you need to say hi to them, you've been feeding them for four days?
Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!
Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania.
Pretty cool, huh? But if you're thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn't get sucked up into the mechanism, well you'd be wrong.
I'm the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!
Why? Why can't the world stop turning, just for a moment? Just for us?
I know.
Right. No big deal.
Yeah.
Come on man there's gotta be something that gets you choked up! Like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?
Hey, kids...
Wait, wait, wait!
All right, listen, Ross... you like this girl, right?
Ohh.
Oh and uh the guy who got the Paris trip is at table four.
Pheebs! Sorry!
Really?
That's way uptown! That's like three trains away! Which is great! I love to ride that rail!
I think I know that girl.
Ohhh.
Oh yeah, sure, no problem, I'll just-hold on one second. "Hey Timmy, I've got a surprise for you!"
You kissed him?!
Now-now, listen this is just a first draft so... "We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to celebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share." Eh? "It is a love based on giving and receiving. As well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared and received. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving." "We too can share and love and have and receive."
I know! That's why they trashed me!
Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.
Hey!
Hi everyone.
She's my biggest fan. Yeah, she's the only one in the family that's believed in me.
Kristen Lang.
That's OK, Ross, you can ask me. What?
You-you think?
Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?
Okay dude! Hey you uh, you sent Kristen flowers.
Okay, I'm all right, okay, but hey, could you just leave your lips?
Check it out!! Jam crackers!
Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate this Pheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle.
Hey!
Hi.
Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!
Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya. I'm sorry man.
Alright, you're on. I can take two minutes out of my day to kick your ass.
This is Vegas man! People will pay to see freaky stuff! Okay, how much would you pay to see this hand twice? Huh?
Question. Was ah, 'Egg the Gellers!' the war cry of your neighbourhood?
Well hey, at least you got to see a lot of stuff, right?
Mmmm. Good.
Pheebs, you gotta stop this, I working on commission here.
Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato. But that's okay, no problem. No problem. Hmm, noodle soup.
They're takin all my stuff back. I guess you were right.
Yeah, we're gonna be fine! Get out!
I need something sweet.
Okay.
It's hard, y'know, his huddle is closer to Dutch girl.
Hey Monica!
You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!
He's kinda tall, dark hair, hand looks exactly like this. See?
Hey.
But, he loves Emily?
Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?
Uhh, Ms. Phalange, may I ask you a question as an impartial person at-at this table?
Hey!
Do you have any respect for your body?
That's not whipped! Whipped is wh-tcssh!
Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday?
Hey!!
I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not.
Hey uh, have you guys scene Chandler?
Really?
Kinda looks like that stuff you get when you get a bad infection.
Yeah! Yeah!
Hey! So, what's with the 20 percent tip? Did I do something wrong?
What is this? Fruit?
What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula.
What?! He got me! Owwwwww!!!
I love you too.
No. Why?
I don't like this anymore.
I'm sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.
What?
Yeah, listen, before I forget that side is still wet.
Oh. Ohh. Ohh, you're out of your mind.
Oh, not my parrot.
Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!
Hey you guys.
Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one?
No way! I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
You guys, can we please not watch this all right.
This is your place?
Naa, she's lyin'.
Sure, if you cared enough to call it first.
Hey. Y'know with that goatee you kinda look like Satan.
No, I-I just heard lunch. But yeah, I can go. Sure!
I don't know.
Nooo, four.
Thanks!
Hey!
I can't tell you what I know.
All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!
Yeah.
All right, congratulations you lucky bastard!
Yeah, it must've fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit a dog.
Yeah, for you!
Hey that's what all my relationships are like.
Nice!
So what are you gonna do?
Where is the waitress?! I'm starving!
And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...
Yeah, he's the reason I didn't get that big Minute Maid commercial a couple of years ago remember? We were supposed to be brothers, but he messed it up.
Where's my underwear?!
Uhh, this is it, this is how we're gonna die. Ready?
You gotta tell Ross how you feel.
I don't know who made you the boss? All right? We invented this game!
Hmm, soup. I mean, noodle soup. I mean soup!
Hey!! Hey-hey-hey!
What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!
Fresh squeezed orange juice, with pulp! Just the way you like it.
Can I tell you something? Me too.
Then you go to Tokyo.
He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes.
Come on man, just-just let the girls stay, I'll do whatever you want.
Barmifsaed?
Whoa!
Okay.
Okay.
Okay, I see what's going on here.
Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember?
All right Phoebs, way to go.
That's a uh, that's a tough combination.
Morning. I just uh, came by to pick up my mail. Where's the mail?
I know! I mean it's not like we weren't cool about it.
Did you get your money back?
Hey!
I did it anyway.
Oh, I'm-I'm not working tomorrow.
Chandler?
And-and-and-and-and-and, and we're gonna be friends again!
Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends, she only talks to agents.
All right, I should get going, big day a work. Y'know I'm in a coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out I'm not brain dead.
Woah, woah, woah, woah. Which sister?
And what's cool is, the character is from Naples, right?
Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department.
Ooh, Ross, look! Look!
Okay.
Hey-ooh Pheebs, are they in there?
Y-sure!
Okay, but I don't see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.
Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.
How'd you get to that?
Then you do. Heh, heh.
Sorry! Sorry, I'm late; sorry, I'm late! My duck and my chick and a fight, it-it was ugly.
Where you going?
Now go! 'Cause you can still catch her! And Merry Christmas from you're secret Santa!
Dude, if you go back out there, you're gonna be Dead Ross!
Hey, hey, check it out, guess what I got.
I mean naked game. Strip poker, we should totally play strip poker.
What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?
Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little.
Hey, woah, let's go down there and get your hat back.
Who knows?
...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt.
Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it.
Come on!
No! Never! Never! Bye.
I know I would.
Hi.
No-no-no-no look no! I won't spit, and I won't stare at Monica's breasts! Y'know? Everyone knows I'm an ass man!
What?
Oh wow Wayne, it's not really something you can teach y'know? It's pretty much something you're born with if you--You-you can teach it! I'll show you right how to do it.
Okay. I will. Ohh! Check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony! Huh? I wear it like this when I marry you guys, and then this is for party time.
No, things are fine with Kathy. I'm having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.
Ross, you should know that my pants are startin' to come down and I'm not wearing any underwear!
Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles.
Thank you. Thank you.
Maybe you need sex. I had sex a couple days ago.
Well, I don't know!!
Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment.
Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and...
Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her.
Look at you. Since when do you roller blade?
What?
Bye-bye!
Oh, 'cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom, there's your admirer.
They know you know.
Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes.
Noo!! I've had the best day ever! Dude, check this out! Now, I'm gonna fastforward past the part with you, 'cause it is boring.
.....Well, this is still ruined, right?
I can't watch this.
That's right, it's all ruined! You guys ruined everything! You ruined it!
Hey!
Just kiddin,' I'll talk to them, you distract Rach.
Oh! My head! Oh! Oh!
Sure, it's hard to forget! But that doesn't mean you have to talk about it! A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never, ever talk about.
Well, it was a fight. . . based on serious stuff, remember. About how I never lived alone or anything. I just think it would be good for me, ya know, help me to grow or. . . whatever.
Hey, can you close that window Chandler? My nipples can cut glass over here!
What?
The Irish gig guy?!
All right, so we should go catch our movie.
Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh.
Oh.
Isn't it? And it's engraved too, check it out.
Ohhh, yeah!
G. I. Joe! Cool! Can I play?
Later!
No problem. Hey Chandler
Uh.
Wait, well, where did you get it from?!
From the land down under? I didn't know that either!
But, but wh-what about us?
Ross! Ross! If you're going to the airport, could you pick me up another one of those Toblerone bars?
Hey Rach, you uh, you want some sandwich?
That's the rule.
Really, hey, you mind if I turn the heat down?
All right. All right.
Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girl...
Hey!
Yeah baby! No baby!
Now, wait a second! You make food and robots?
That's true.
Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.
Nana?
Yeah.
You can't make crotchless panties? You take, you take a pair of scissors and you just cut...
Hey! Oh.
Good luck Phoebs.
Oh that's okay. Hey, actually in a way it's kinda nice. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!
Look at this clown! Just because he's got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. Get out of the way jackass! Who names his boat Coast Guard anyway?
Oh wow, what a beautiful name! What is it again?
Hey!
Is everything okay?
All right, give it back to me. 5 of hearts.
There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!
Well, I've just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paper that didn't have naked chicks on it.
Me too! Yeah. And comfortable. Do uh, do you like leather seats?
Hey!
Check it out. How much of a man am I?!
I didn't finish my five pages.
Wow! Maybe uh, maybe you and I ought to get to know each other a little better.
Thanks man.
...feel like getting a cup of coffee?
And I know both of them, they're really good. One of them is the guy from those allergy commercials who's always getting chased by those big flowers...
Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!
Well why don't you just reach out and take his trampoline.
I can fix it. Hold on. Look out. Look out.
That uh, that is my roommate Rachel.
And the winner is...Joey Tribbiani! Oh... Wow! I honestly never expected this. I uh, I didn't prepare a speech. But umm, I'd like to thank my parents, who've always been there for me. I'd also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel...
The Silly Putty! It's not so silly anymore!
Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember?
Do you want any help?
Hey.
Really? Who-who have you taught?
Pantyhose! Y'know? They way they start at your toe and go all the way up to here... I should go take these off shouldn't I?
Plastic spoons. Great.
Well, I sorta am. I mean yeah, I'm dating this girl who's also seeing another guy. But, I don't know, I'm not to worried about it.
Wanna play strip poker for practice?
No you don't, I just saw you go in there with Monica!
You ah, you forgot your shoes.
Hey.
Oh mama! Uh when-when is the baby due?
No-no-no! Look, I've been thinking about it. I'm an actor right? So I won't get nervous talking in front of people.
Yeah, why don't you move in with me? It'll be great! We could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursday's right?
Hey!
Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges.
Spock's birth control.
Ross. I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape.
All right, what are we havin'?
Are you all right?
Heh... I was bluffing.
Oh whoa-whoa wait a minute! I have to do it?!
Then why are you wearing Monica's jacket?
All right, I'm sorry. Rach I-Rach I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry! Maybe I can make up for it by, taking you roughly in the barn.
I dont care. Phoebes Phoebe. Ursulas... hot!
No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.
This is great, this is great, what else, what else?
With Carol? Oh.
Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought you'd be out partying with Gandel-worf.
Did I not just tell him?
You're not going to believe this!
Told ya.
Noo! I can't take any more secrets! I've got your secrets. I've got their secrets. I got secrets of my own y'know!
Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.
Dude, they're not objects.
Look, I just need a wire something to jimmy it. Oh hey, one of you guys give me the underwire from your bra!
As in Rosita does not move.
No! Because he didn't believe in my movie! Which is a big mistake because it is real! Real!
That's the title! Yeah! Y'know they really lucked out that the initials spell cheese.
Yeah! Why don't you stick around. You can sit right there.
Oh, now it's a spare room?
Oh, I don't know Pheebs. It'll be okay.
Hey Mon, do you have another pillow? Y'know, something a little snugglyer?
Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates.
What?
Ohh, I love birds.
Uh, y'know, starve a fever, go to a play for a cold.
Hey, you know about that?!
Yeah. Uh, ...a slice......six dollars?
I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.
Sure, neighbor come on in.
You think it would be okay if I asked out your sister?
That's right! I'm taking the essence.
Am I psyched? The lead in my own TV series? I've dreamed about this for years! Why have I not been preparing?!
Did you not hear the plot of the movie? "She's been dead for ten years." I'm gonna be a millionaire!
Are you all finished here?
Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.
Yeah but, I can pronounce Jurassic.
Yeah!
She told us.
Huh. But still Ross, you're worst day with two women, pretty much better than any other day! Y'know what I mean?
Forget about it.
Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don't have time! They're just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.
Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever had!!
Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us?
I don't know. But hey, I know we can decide. Okay, I'm gonna ask you questions and you answer real quick. Okay?
Hey! You ready to go?
Sounds nice.
Yeah?
Y'know, about what happened with us.
That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.
So you're playing a little Playstation, huh? That's whack! Playstation is whack! 'Sup with the whack Playstation, 'sup?! Huh? Come on, am I 19 or what?!
That's it! Thanks Pheebs!
Hey, here she comes.
Hey, there's a dog out there!
Hi, Rach.
We good? Yeah? Good? Once again, I pronounce you husband and wife. Now kiss her again.
Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?
I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.
Hey Chandler. Come on in. We're knitting pot holders.
Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?
Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now.
NO!!!
Hit me! Ohh man! Wait!
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.
Wh-what's going on?
So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe... huh-huh?
Okay, now the Mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic period.
Hey.
How do you mean?
Ohh yeah, that's the stuff.
Well usually...yeah! Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice. Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. I'm such a jerk.
How do we say yes now and make it seem like we're not doin' it just to ride in the cool car?
We don't make enough fun of you already?
Whoa-whoa-whoa. What ah, what happened to playing the field?
No, I-I figured you would've picked a blond guy.
Yeah, I wouldn't know about that.
Wow!
Oh, man, she loved it! She's over there showing Monica and Rachel right now.
What are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me?
I know! My grandmother's gonna see this!
Oh I like this place. And technically, technically I'm not breaking any rules so I...
Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.
Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?
Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still.
Jo's there, but I don't think there's anything she could do.
Well, I think we all learned something.
Me too.
Well I guess I gotta start savin' up for Ross's birthday, so I guess I'll just stay home and eat dust bunnies.
Yeah, you're right. Okay look, listen, let's talk about what a huge star I'm gonna be!
Okay. Can I squeeze your ass?
One of the virus victims called in sick, so Cathy recommended me and boom, I'm dying on the gurney. Oh Ross, Marcel just finished his last scene if you want to go down there and say goodbye.
What?!! That's even worse!!
Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually.
You guys have one of those signs that says 'We don't swim in your toilet, so don't pee in our pool.', you know.
Who's Elaine?
I'm so sorry. Look, if it was up to me you would never leave the show.
Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well, when Ross said Rachel at the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here.
I'm not listening to you!
What do you mean?
Come on, quite yankin' me.
Can you believe this place?
All right, that's it! He cannot do this to Phoebe. This guy is going to get the butt kicking of a lifetime! But, is he a big guy?
Okay!
Huh, Rach I got to say it's gonna take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude.
Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers.
Oooooh...
I can't! It-it's stuck!
What? No-no it's her birthday!
RACHEL PLEASE!!! JUST HAVE DINNER WITH US!!!
I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did.
Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear.
What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!
What is with your nose?
Aw, come on! It'll be years before I forget you!
Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?
No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.
Listen also we're uh, we're watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over.
Hey! You guys! You're not gonna believe this! I just got off the phone with my agent...
Thanks, yeah. I love this but ya know what, it makes me wanna pee.
Yes, it's in my... In...in my pocket. My back pocket! My back pocket!
Me neither, y'know what-
Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio. Hey Monica listen is-is Phoebe there? I gotta ask her something about the car.
Well, the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money, so I'm working here 'til it starts up again, if it ever does.
Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?
Yeah.
Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're dead! You're gone! You're worm food! ...So Chandler looks gay, huh?
Ohhh. Ahh! What are you doing?! I thought you were gonna take her back to the store today.
Nice.
Of course it's true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on?
How come you don't live with Mommy? How come Mommy lives with that other lady? What's a lesbian?
Okay, shoot.
Yeah! Okay.
Gettin' drunk and going to a strip club.
Sure, no problem. Ooh-Hey, donuts!
Ha-ha, very funny-Look! I don't know what to do! I really want you guys to get along. Just please come to the movie with us. I mean you owe me!
No! No, I'm the minister! All right, look-look, put 'em both on the phone, I'll marry them right now.
Okay!
I'm a man.
No.
They loved me!
Uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard?
Hey, Monica, the knob was broken so I just turned it off from underneath, I hope that's alright.
Oh we flipped for it. I got the cigar, he got the moustache. Figured if we both grew it, we'd look like dorks.
Ooh, very official.
Okay.
Re! Re! Then I can watch that! Rewind it! Rewind it!
I don't know! But it's the same!
This man is my God.
Haven't you ever read the same book over and over again?
"Take good care of your Momma son."
Hey Erica, c'mon in.
Yeah? I just figured y'know, after living with you it'd be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, y'know? Someone I can learn from, someone-someone who's different than me. And what's more different than me; a guy who's not 19 than say a girl who is 19? Enh? Not just a hat rack my friend!
Well, there's gonna be strippers there. He didn't say anything about no strippers.
Over there! Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said "No," you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!
What?! I didn't touch a guitar!
Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually didn't get a callback.
All right! Here we go! 1999! The year of Joey!
Saw a girl with that vest.
Great scene yeah?
Oh great! Y'know I would've been perfect for this part, but whatever! Y'know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day!
You want my advice?
Well, it involved Monica.
Yeah I did!
I-I-I-I did?
He's doin' some thinkin'!
Okay, fine, I will bring you a tape, huh?
Who?
Well, I'm telling everyone about you! That's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!
Eh, what are you gonna do?
Let's ride.
No, I'm gonna!! That's right! Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin' out with that girl! Like-like-like I did something terrible to you! And now Pheebs, you're doing the same thing!
Whoa!!!
All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat...
He can still catch her! Come on, get out of there! Get out of there!
Wow.
Hey, Ross, Bodington's!
Nice move.
Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name.
Alrightalrightalright. There.
Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.
The silk? Feels really good!
You are so the man! Now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, 'cause my Grandma doesn't know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah.
One! No ten! You said ten! You can't take that back!
Sure.
No.
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!
Hi!
What are you gonna do?
You couldn't do it?!
What's it sound like? It's a guy with my identical hands! It was incredible! Chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like me! It-it was like looking at my hands in a mirror!
Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?
I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?
Yeah, they're not coming.
Oh, it's perfect!
Chandler, look they're actors. They're there to do a job, just 'cause they work together, doesn't mean they're gonna get together. I mean just 'cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn't mean it's gonna happen with them.
No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool.
Oh, ahh, go to the window. I'm wanna run down to the truck and show you something.
Yeah! Wow, your like from a whole other country.
Ooh! So close.
Oh yeah, who's playing?
Aw! Does that mean the Sam Goody's sale is over?!
Come on! It'll be fun! Me, you, and Ross, and... Paul probably...
All right, all right, all right, all right, you wanna know what I do when I take resume shots?
I don't know, maybe I can't. I mean, maybe there's something wrong with me.
And a couple of these little tiny boxes.
Marcel, I'm hungry.
What? That's not? Oh my God.
He hooked up! He hooked up with someone.
Argh!
Oh, we're supposed to just get him a ticket?! That guy is always mooching off of us!
Thank God! I'm exhausted!
Oh, it's easy. Yeah, I-I can do it with anything. Watch uh, Grandma's chicken salad...
Say that to him and you're golden.
All right.
Yeah! All right? Let's go!
No! I won't leave you!
Morning, hey, you made pancakes?
If you didn't want to play, why did you come to the party?
Wait a minute. That sounds a little familiar! Did they already do that one? 'Cause I think I read it!
Yeah? Well, I don't want to talk to you Wayne! I hate you! You ruined my life! Oh, Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler.
Oh, I'd love too, but I got acting class. But y'know what? I guess I can blow that off, for you.
Hey.
Well my old man is doing a plumbing job down there and he heard they have an opening. So, you want me to see if I can get you an interview?
Well, she graduated from high school!
This body?
Wow. Good speech.
Okay. All right. Umm, so uh, so how did it happen? Did your eyes meet across the room? And then the next thing y'know you're in the bathtub together and she's feeding you strawberries?
Yeah!
That's an idea! Hey, if I hired an assistant, would-would you take money from her?
Fumble!
Yeah! That guy's all right!
But what does that gonna do...
Sure, what do you want to see?
Okay.
No-no, this only took five minutes. I spent the rest of the day coming up with new, Ultimate Fireball. Ha-ha!
Hey Pheebs, guess who we saw today.
There's gravy?
Hey.
I will not take this abuse.
Wait! Terry! Wait-Look-Wait I-I... Look, I'm really sorry about before. I was an idiot thinking I'm too big to audition for you. You gotta give me another chance.
Yeah, he likes porn.
Ooh-ooh, I! I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having.
Yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that I finished it. And uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it. So would you guys read it for me?
But sadly I could not be enticed.
Alright look, that's it. I don't think we should see each other anymore, alright. Look, I know I should have told you this a long time ago but I am not Drake Remore, OK. I'm not even a doctor, I'm an actor. I just pretend to be a doctor.
It's uh, right through there.
Yeah, it's not mine.
No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.
Wow Pheebs, you speak Italian?
Yeah you got 5 years left!
It'll be great for next weekend. I mean, it'll be grrreat.
You know what the. . .
Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.
Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does, ok. If you try to pull somethin', he'll call you on it. 'What're you tryin' to pull,' he'll say.
No, no, no, I'm telling ya. Imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand okay? So the question is, what do we do?
Here. Now I only owe you $49.50.
Oh hey listen I got us tickets to a Knicks game tonight.
He forgot to leave his grip size!
Careful! You're wasting good pastrami! Oh my God! I'm my dad!
Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.
I think I'm gonna take-off.
Well so, how come you blew me off? Y'know? How come you were with him?
Eddie.
Nooooo!!! Y'know what? Now that I think about it, I constantly find myself without twenties and you always have lots!
If you want, I'll sell my friends and use the money to buy you presents.
Cause she uh, she steals stuff.
Oh yeah? And who do you like?
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...
I don't know why you just don't say left.
Yeah, unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons.
All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. And they're off!
Oh, and plus I'm 1/16th Portuguese.
Okay. "It's a typical New York City apartment. Two guys are hanging out." Ross
Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!
Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?
Yeah Bing, what's that about?
Bye, Pheebs!
They're ribbed for your pleasure.
Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me.
Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man.
Dude, this isn't funny! What am I gonna do?! I go to bed last night, everything's cool! I wake up this morning, the stripper's gone and the ring is gone!
Ah, the stalker.
Well, it's good thing you got out when you did, before she blew up like that Vesuvius.
Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.
You do have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are you, are you crazy?!
Rach, you're killin' us here, will ya serve the dessert already? Those drunken dancers are waiting!
All right.
How's that pig-in-the-blanket workin' out for you? I wrapped those bad boys.
Hey! Great, you're home! Guess what Phoebe got me for Christmas!
Whoa-whoa! No-no-no-no-no, nothing is going up! Okay? Up, up is not an option-what's a urethra? Are you crazy?!
Because! You're mean on the boat!
You got it! And the rabbi's beard, 100% horsehair. Nice catch C.H.E.E.S.E.! It's your line C.H.E.E.S.E.! Wayne! Wayne!!
Ooh-ho-ho!
Every night!!
Yeah-yeah, absolutely.
Well y'know, I've been walking the same way since high school. Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I need a 'take notice' walk.
Hey you guys, check it out. Check it out. It's like it's coming right at me.
No-no-no! No-no wait Rach, you know what would even be more fun? Telling them.
No.
What you-you don't think I'm gonna win?
You didn't cry when Bambi's mother died?
And-and-and not only that, I'm gettin' a new brain!!
Yeah, maybe he just cheated on you.
So I got your car, it's right outside.
You own the room. We should probably get-get uh...
Iced tea.
When I was little, I wanted to be a veteranarian, but then I found out you had to put your hands into cows and stuff.
Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside.
It's just that, I, I'm gonna miss Joseph. I liked him. His wife, she was hot.
But uh, uh, what about uh, Ross and uh. . .?
Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?
Woah, dude, burn.
PBS telethon.
You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?
Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie.
That's right, I have a phone in here.
Whoa-whoa-whoa! Before you start handing out wedding rings and planning bachelor parties, don't you have to decide who your best man is gonna be?
Phoebe, could you do me a favour? Could you try this on? I just wanna make sure it fits.
No! It's not okay! It's not okay at all!! You're dead inside!!
That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously? Okay.
Oh.
But you got to be with both of them, right?
Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.
Wow! Didn't know that.
Chandler! He's here!
Hey!
Well, what if they came in third in a modeling contest?
Fuggetaboutit. How you doin?
I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants.
Really?
Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.
Everybody's doing stuff!
And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don't fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they'll start listening to all the nice things I've been saying about you.
Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!
Hey, you guys!
Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... Although actually I'm really not that hungry...
Yep! Looks like it's gonna be a leeeeean Christmas at the Dragon house this year.
I say push her down the stairs.
Ahhh, I fold like a cheap hooker who got hit in the stomach by a fat guy with sores on his face. Oh, I'm out.
No-no-no, I think I'm gonna see how things go with Kathy. She's pretty cool.
Pheebs?
To her parent's I think and she said you shouldn't call her. But if I were you I would.
Let me see that!
Chandler?
Yeah good luck, good luck.
Hey everybody! Uh, I'd like you to meet Janine. She's-she's gonna be my new roommate!
You gave him cookies?
They want me to be totally naked in the movie!
No, inside good, outside bad.
I know! I'm sorry! The guy's drunk, they won't let me go until we get this.
What?!! That's even worse!!
You practice losing the Grammies too?
Dude, you don't have to brag! We got nothing here!!
I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.
B-bye Janice. So when ya' dumpin' her.
Well I tell ya, I should probably buy a place in the city first. And I just got what you meant again-That is-I tell ya, that is a tricky one!
What do you like better action or comedy?
Why don't you tell me something I don't know!
Ohh great!!!
And the best part is, we're filming in the desert outside Vegas! And you know what that means buddy!
Hey listen, so when's-when's my audition? I mean I know it's Thursday, but what time?
Oh-ooh-ooh! Y'know what's a good visual aide?
Well, not that its any of your business, but, no, we havent, okay?
Wait. Give him a minute.
Nope.
So you're the gynaecologist?
Hey!
Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant.
But I counted, you're not supposed to live here! Oh man!
Look, I'm telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here it doesn't hurt that bad.
Hey!
Ah, now Rach, these ah, these little women.
So, there was no miracle?!
You're right, you're right, I'll get back to work.
No no no, behind it.
Oh.
Hey!
My Giant? I love that movie!
Well can you at least stay to the end of the play? I mean, I'll go to the airport with ya, I-I wanna say good bye.
You're one to talk.
All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! It's not like he's...Chandler!
Hey! Where have you been?
Here she comes. Hold on, I'm gonna make your life much easier.
Oh yeah?
No.
Mornin'. I said, mornin'.
Oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya.
Yeah! Well, I think we'll see if they actually let you play. Huh? I mean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like, "You look 19," and then they just take it away like-like, "No you don't."
Yeah, it is! You wouldn't have lost the ring, right? Y'know what, Ross you were right from the start, he should be your best man.
Come on baby, come on!
Hey! So, did you watch the tape of my show?
Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want Ross out of the picture.
-Peaches?
Hey, woah, hey, woah.
Come on Rach, not again. I got it! Okay? Let's start sailing, and I want to go over there where that boatload of girls is! Yo-ho-ho!
Where are you gettin' this?
Y'know, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?
Okay, you're on.
We're now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, "I do" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!
Ooh, hey, I know how we can decide! All right, uh, I'm gonna ask you a bunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast. Okay? So uh, clear your mind Clear it right out! Clear it out! Clear!
See ya tomorrow!
Good for you!!
Yeah?
It's him, not it!
So you like the nachos uh? Myself I'm partial to...
Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks.
Ohhhh man
Hey, listen, lady.... ...whoa.
No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway.
How many times do I have to tell you! Ya, turn and sliiiide! Y'know, turn and slide.
We should really learn how to play the real way.
You're kiddin'.
Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.
Later! Oh man! Hot girl! Hot girl!!
Yeah, she said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day.
It's not my first time.
Like the three musketeers, only with fruit.
My animals. Hey the guy said they suited me, he spoke with an accent, I was all confused. I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Yeah, yeah. He's got a, he's got a really bad cough, and our vet, he can't do anything about it. Is there something you can do?
Wha-
Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?
Yeah, I know.
I want to go on a ride along!
Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots.
Oh-no, don't try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.
In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.
Yep!
Yeah!
Well then let me do it!
Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman! And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition! Okay, look, if I have to pretend I don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about.
Well, now we got a reason.
Well, I couldn't do it. I told her I didn't want to get the part that way.
Oh man! Now she's gonna start all over! We're never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world!
Yeah, take a hike wetpants!
Hey Gunther, don't let that guy in here anymore! He just said Phoebe's a porn star!
I'm, I'm okay. See.
Ho-ho-ho, fried stuff with cheese!
Fine.
Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not.
Waiting for candy.
OH YES!!!!!
No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her.
Hey.
Hey-hey.
Was his name Angus?
Something like that?
Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What about you, having those babies for your brother? Talk about selfish!
I'd love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. She's sleeping. Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink?
Psss, that is whack!
So you've just married the one time then?
Yeah. Yeah, so what? Look, I live across the street, and I know all about you and your little telescope, and I don't appreciate it, okay? Yeah, I can see you right now! Hello! If I wanna walk around my apartment in my underwear, I shouldn't have to feel like Thank you, but... that's not really the point... The point is that... Mostly free weights, but occasionally..
Oh no, not you too!
Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.
What?!
You know those posters for the city free clinic?
Yeah. Cushions the blow.
Oh, you're Phoebe's fan!
You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!
What? Rachel, listen, have you ever heard of Fortunata Fashions?
Hey. It happened!
Yes!
Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joey's your pal. Joey's your buddy. "Where is everybody?" "Well, they're hanging out with Joey."
How?! When?!
Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!
Hey! Now, I've been watching some tapes, how's this? "Jessica Lockhart will never step foot in this place again! Ever!!"
Yeah, whatever.
Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me?
I know. Yeah, his name is Pat.
Sorry, that was wax.
Pizza!! We like Pizza!! Get out!!!
Hey! Mine was by accident! All right, the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel, and kills the dad.
Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.
Uh, well yeah-yeah, I've got all of that going on. Yeah, listen uh, I want you to make sure you tell Chandler that he couldn't have been more wrong! Uh-oh! I gotta go Monica, my uh, my sushi's here!
I will, really. I'll pay you back this time.
I can't find the remote. Thank you.
You really think so?
Yeah! Once.
All righty, what do you say we head back to my place?
Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. Y'know, because you don't want to be doing something and then look up and see something you don't want to be seeing.
What?
Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me. They...feel a little unwanted.
Don't do it!
There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight, alright?
Yeah, I guess it is. Listen, I ah, I gotta say good bye, and-and I gotta say it quick 'cause this is killing me. One thing you gotta know, is that I will never forget you. But, you've got things you have to do now, and so do I. And so... I'm gonna get on this spaceship, and I'm gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, you'll be long gone. But I won't have aged at all. So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne, baby, I'm gonna want to meet her.
I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out. So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log.
Wait a minute.
Hey, wouldn't be cool if our duck and chick had a little baby? We could call it Chuck.
Great. You got anything that's not Ralph Lauren?
Huh? Never really thought about the writers. The scripts just kinda come to my house. But you know what? This makes me look good, which makes the show look good, which makes the writers look good so how could they be mad about that?
Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?
Is it the shampoo? It's guava.
They let you get married when you're drunk! Most people who get married in Vegas are drunk!
You're a dork.
Hi. We're the guys who called about the baby. We left the baby on ths bus. Is he here? Is he here?
Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.
Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there . Soo...
Yeah. And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous rock formation.
Sir.
Hey, listen, I gotta tell ya, I feel kinda bad taking credit for this, because man, am I gonna get a lot of credit for this!
All right. Okay. Well this is the same kind of deal. If you're going to do something wrong, do it right!
Come on you guys, one more time.
If you wanna get back in the car, we need the wire, your call.
Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laceys.
No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. . Oh, hi, you know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair ?
Animals dressed as humans.
Umm...
Did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex with his wife and then fall right out of your chair?
Hey Pheebs! Listen, uh can you do me a favor? I forgot the pin number to my ATM card can, can you get it for me?
No idea? Who do you think brought her here?
You guys need anything, 'cause I'm heading up there.
Hey. That uh, that my sweatshirt?
I don't! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australian dancer.
All right! Hey, who wants pizza?!
Oh my God!!
That's great, but isn't it gonna bother that people still think you're a porn star?
I gotta go check something over here.
Fine! Now, where'd we land on those pancakes?
Oh we're not out. No, no. We're just uh, two heterosexual guys, hanging with the son of our other heterosexual friend, doin' the usual straight guy stuff.
Are you bachelors?
Thank you.
'My scones.'
Yeah, that was a tricky one. In reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours, but they only showed it for 2 minites.
Oh, it was great! I mean we walked all around the village. We went to this ice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but still... And guess what, I'm thinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts.
Ew! What is that? Something exploded!
Yeah, sure. Well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography.
So why don't you give me your number?
Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valente's.
What the hell is in there?
Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what woulda happened.
Great! Problem solved!
Really? Thanks.
How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
I am telling you Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again! Now, is that what you want?
Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does.
I-I think everybody's pretending they don't hear you. Anyway, look, I don't know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, I'm telling you, he will sit in it! Ross! Ross! Over here, man! I-I saved you seat.
Okay.
What?!
Yeah, we'll be fine.
Get out.
Closeness-shmoshness! There was three of us for crying out loud!
Y-y-yeah! Yeah you do.
So, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you and me and Chandler?
Oh yeah...
Yeah!
I was thinking Chinese food.
Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something might've happened to a huge chunk of it.
Tribbiani.
Uh, excuse me. Jerry is the director, which one's he?
All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay? You're hot. I'm lovable. Clearly there's a vibe going on between us. But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.
Wh-what?! Why?!
Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me? Did you know this isn't Ma?
Nope, got it and I got yours too.
Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food! What's the matter?
I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to?
Let it go, Ross.
You serious?
Oh hey, do you still have their final exams?
That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!
If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah.
Look, Chandler I don't think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. Okay? Just go and find Monica!
Never had that dream.
Dude, I screwed up, you don't have to turn me in!
Fortune! This guy is so stupid. It's Count Rushmore!!
Uh, Pheebs, you're leaking?
You a little sad about that sweetheart?
Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh...
Wow, talk about your bad luck, I mean, the first time you try panties and someone walks off with your clothes.
Oh my God! I cannot believe you guys are talking about this! The problems in the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! All right?!! Now Chandler is doing the best he can!!
What, what is it?
Whoa, jam! I love jam! Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?
Face to face, yeah!
Yeah, it was! All right, listen, I can't...
Hey-hey-hey!
My Giant? I love that movie!
Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?
All right, you got it.
"When can you move in?"
No one.
Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together.
I don't know! But it's the same!
How is "Monica, I love your sweet ass," inappropriate?
Oh sorry, I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross. Who-who's Barry and Mindy?
Oh, I will.
They did it right there on the couch.
Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross, check it out: hockey tickets, Rangers-Penguins, tonight at the Garden, and we're taking you.
Just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth?
WHOAA!!
Come on Pheebs! I can't take this anymore! Let-let me make it up to you. Huh? Ground control to Major Tom. Commencing countdown, engines on. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on!
Oh, no!
That's what that was?! 'Cause that other thing? I thought you were on to something, but it did nothing for me.
So what are we gonna do?! We have no reinforcements! No-no food!
When you're off the phone, do you wanna get a pizza?
This right here is where I keep the pizza. And uh that's where the napkin is.
Why would you want to do that?
Man, I'm getting pretty tired. You're might have to take over soon.
I call Monica's room!
Someone you didn't make up!
Hey!
We make fire. Cook meat.
Hey!
How do you mean?
Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me.
I know!
What happened to the foosball?
Look, what do you want me to say?
Mornin' Pheebs!
Hey! You guys! Check it out, check it out! Guess which job I got.
I'm having surgery!
Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago.
Well, have-have you told him how you feel?
Hey.
Well he made Rachel cry!
Well it hit me anyway! And it would've hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer.
Foxy lady.
Hey!
Are you kidding me? I never rent a movie without it! Oh. Uh, okay uh let me call you back.
Oh! That's nice.
Pheebs, run!
Seventeen-fourteen Giants... three minutes to go in the third.
That's good, just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time.
Hi! How are the Gellers?
All right, I'll take a box of the cream filled Jesus's.
How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free.
Uh, take a look at the guy's pants! I mean, I know you told us to show excitement, but don't you think he went a little overboard?
Well, you gotta give him something that he can't say no too. Like uh, Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you're guaranteed he'll say yes!
Oh. What?
Well you-you-you-you might say congratulations! I saw the board! I went to the audition! I got the part!!
Come on man, you drove all the way up here.
Hey, Kate!
All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game.
How is it you?
Look at this! A millionaire's checkbook.
Or maybe, it's because you're hanging around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday.
What 'cha doing?
And that's Wednesday. Ohh.
Y'know, I can see why you think that, but ah, actually, you know who I think it is?
Hey Monica!
Then she came back with "The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a bomb?"
Alright... I've got to go shower.
Ah, y'know just in general people being gay, thing. I'm totally cool with that.
From now on, it's gonna be Joey and Ross, best friends. Okay! We're gonna be the new Joey and Chandler.
Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.
The allergy guy got the part! Thanks!
Yeah. What are we getting?
I got this pair marked excess, I gotta tell ya, there was no room for excess anything in there.
Alright open your eyes.
Yeah! Much! Listen uh, not that I'm y'know insecure about my manhood or anything y'know, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right now.
Hey!
Wh-wh-what's going on? Wh-what's this about L.A.?
A little foos?
Well, these really are the days of our lives.
Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?
She's not crazy is she?
You shut up! I love arguing with her. I'll be right back.
Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man! All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time. And whatever you say, I'll believe ya. Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?!
Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried!
Oh good! Can I tell her?! Can I tell her?!
Was she happy you gave her the job?
Thank you!
Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jo's manuscript. I don't see how he could ever forgive her.
Wow!!
Hey guys! Look who's back! It's Ray-ray!
Great. Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the spoons.
We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man.
Her name is Dutch, and also Marklan.
Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!
Okay! Okay, look! You-you-you got Harrison Ford up there!
And she's back in the game.
I'm sorry, it just felt nice.
Yeah, you're roommate is a soap opera star.
And a 50. Huh, these must be Chandler's pants.
Yeah, yeah. It's like my chance to give something back to the acting community.
Hey man, you feeling any better?
Okay, really good. Anyway I gotta go; I'm late for work.
Oh, no. Ah, I playing your husband, Victor. I'm Joey Tribianni.
Well, I get the medical award for separating the siamese twins. Then Amber and I go to Venezuela to meet our other half-brother, Ramone. And that's where I find the world's biggest emerald. It's really big but it's cursed.
Look, it's a nice gesture, it is. But it just feels like--
They're here already?
I don't know how to lead.
Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know.
No, I'm alright man. Really.
Yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck got sick!
Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together.
No, no, I didn't mean you. But, you believed me, huh?
So, what did you guys think?
Hard to tell, I was naked.
Well, may I ask for one example?
About what?
I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.
Beth is really, really sick.
I-I wasn't in that.
Now that's a thinker.
Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it's getting darker and more painful, that means it's healing.
Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?
Felicity and I, we're watching My Giant, and I was thinking, "I'm never gonna be as good an actor as that giant." Do you think I'm just wasting my life with this acting thing?
One-Mississippi. Two-Mississippi. Three-Mississippi.
So, we're having fun, right?
But it really...
I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex.
What?!
Oh, God!
No, but I'm gonna!
...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See, I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here.
Oh yeah, yeah, sure. Absolutely.
Oh, ha-ha-ha! Ooh! Wait a minute, I used to get medical experiments down on me all the time!
No, but he's...
Oh well, okay, good luck.
No plans, huh?
I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands...
Nice, nice. Hey I got somethin' for you. [hands Chandler an envelope.
Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. There's no meat in beer, right?
Because it's all tainted with your betrayal. From now on this apartment is empty for me! And I'm not happy about you either. Oh, and just so you know, I made that bread for you.
Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?
I bet that kiss isn't looking like such a big mistake now, is it?
So what.
Hello.
Thank you! Well, I guess now I know who I'm taking to the awards.
Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.
Pheebs, I am so sorry! I know I promised you a fun road trip with your friend and I didn't deliver. But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship! So, so, so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as I know you.
No kiddin', hmm.
Of course!!
What?! What?!! What is it?!
Hey, hey. How was the first day?
All right! Just hurry up!
There are?
What are you ah, what are you gonna do?
Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
Surprise!!
Didn't I tell ya? Always showin' off.
Maybe, my ruler's wrong.
Because, Monica, the guy's so good, and I really, really want this part.
All right, relax, relax. Just relax, just relax. Be cool, be cool.
Well, I can't do everything! Look back over your time together.
Hey!
Hey, opposite, is opposite!
Oh my God! That's huge! Wait a minute, why come I wasn't invited? And who was going to be your best man? Don't say, "Ross." Do not say, "Ross."
So Monica, still going out with Dr. Boring huh?
Nooo, later.
Well you're whippin' so slow! Can't you do it any faster?
Man, this is a long drive! Are my eyes open? No!
A handsome man enters. Hey! How's it going guys? I don't know what you two were talking about, but I'd like to say thanks to both of you. You, you wouldn't let me give up on myself, and you well you co-created Fireball. The end.
Will you calm down, he's just a human guy.
I can't believe you. You told me it was a nubbin.
You kissed my girlfriend!
Hey! Hey Chandler look, I know you're mad, but I just want to say I'm sorry. I-I was a total jerk. Completely o-over the line. Uh, I just I hate pulp! Y'know? I mean, y'know how Monica feels about low fat mayonnaise?
Oh unless you uh, you wanna hang around.
Hey, I'm back!
Hey! Hey! Be careful around my Porsche!
Oh, just, y'know.... science.
No, my first fan mail.
Uh, don't you mean "for whom?"
Uhhhh.... I'll just pee in the street.
Alright. Cab driver number two?
So I'm thinking, basically we pick it up and then we flip it.
No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity...anymore.
Can we come it yet?! We're dying out here!
I said name one!
Oh God, yeah.
Yeah. I understand. I understand. Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first!
Yes that's the one about the soldiers who fight in World War I!
So, you just left? Her place was really that bad?
Yeah, hero sandwiches.
What happened?
No you won't. Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, he's sorry. But, you've got one more apology to make, all right, you've got to apologize to Mary-Angela.
We could climb Mt. Everest!
Dude, you soooo need this car.
Do you uh, do you-ready for a refill?
Beth, Beth dies?
Big day.
Well I didn't tell them!
Oh I-I uh, found the keys and now I'm just polishing her up.
Listen, I know you're new, but it's kinda understood that everything from Young Men's to the escalator is my territory.
Hey, yeah! Then we could do that telephone thing! Y'know, you have a can, we have a can and it's connected by a string!
So Pheebs, do they know about each other?
Warm milk and Excedrin P.M.
That he doesn't exist.
Yeah.
Yeah, but, hey look, don't go through her stuff. She gets really mad.
What is it?
"I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke."
Don't come out here!
Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?!
But what about how much taller he is than me?
Thursday! Look if you need help remembering think of like this, the third day. All right? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when? Huh? What day? Thursday! The third day! Okay?!
Nothing. No, nothing.
There was a seen in Footloose...
There's my scene, there's my scene. "Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wanna know how I did it, I'll show ya. When you handed me back the card, what you didn't see was, I looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye. I just did it. I just did it, again. Here, I'll slow it down so that you guys can see it.
What?
What are these, like famous chickens?
Listen, I ah, went to that restaurant that you were talking about last week...
Did-did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear?
I fell down an elevator shaft.
Uhh, just a minute officer!!
Are you strippers?
Huh?
Wow! I can't believe this! This is incredible. I mean you just won an Oscar!
This is amazing.
Relax. Here hold this . This old stuff just comes right off.
You can't go out there.
That's right!
All right.
All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today.
You look like a freak.
Aww, man. That's the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out he's my roommate, she's gonna tell him what I did.
Maybe we shouldn't pay our gas bill?
Uh, de-clawing cats. Hey, tell ya what. Let me walk you home. We'll stop by every news stand and burn every copy of their Times and the Post.
No. Nope, I uh...I th-I thought it might be kind of a cool character thing. Y'know? He's uh, he's a face toucher.
Not in my head.
Listen, I ah, I know it's a longshot. But, by any chance did she find that funny?
Who said it was for you?
And?
Nooo.
Fifty-six!
What's wrong with the twentieth?
Hey.
Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.
IN LONDON!!!
Uhh, do you mind sitting there. I'm-I'm saving this for my friend Ross.
I don't know, birds just don't say, "Hello, sit here, eat something."
Hiya.
Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers they're just, you know, they're nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of a famous baby.
Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn't think big enough to fit a grown man!
Morning! Hey, how's my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?!
What's up man?
Hey! Wanna play some foosball? Please?
Dahhhhh!! No! Noooo!!
Morning, Paul.
And that'll get rid of my wisdom?
Well all right so, it looks like we're even!
He doesn't do much, does he?
Oh... Can you imagine if I hadn't left you that last one? You two might've never gotten together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sent that hooker up to the room like I was gonna?! It's like it was in the stars!
Ohh, then no. Maybe I should hear those specials again.
You hug me!
Of course I'm jokin'! I don't take checks.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, they do! Quit being a baby and leave me alone! There, you've just had your first class!
And I ate the food, I had the fish, it was good, yeah. It was good, yeah...
Yeah! Yeah. I'll be all right.
Oh, hey let me.
You don't think my mom's sexy?
Not following you.
Hey Rach?
We just got the message.
No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed.
You're really thinking about having sex with your brother?!
No! No-no. Look, there's a bug stuck in tar right here.
Hi!
Yeah, yeah. Hey, why don't you give a pull on that rope?
Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink?
Oh, how bad is it?
Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist too!
How is this your seat?
Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It's one of my gifts.
The question should be Rach, what is not so great about the shining. Okay? And the answer would be nothing. All right? This is like the scariest book ever. I bet it's way better than that classic of yours.
Anybody want to say good-bye to me at the car?
I don't know. Maybe pizza?
What?! Tonight?!
How ya doin'?
I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that I can't take care of myself. Okay? Look, I'm not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing that I'm gonna miss...is you. And now the dog.
Excellent.
Oh my God!
Thanks for coming Mrs. Greene. Well, ok, you take care.
Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still get cake right?
Damnit Phoebe!!
Wow! There's a lot I didn't know about vomit. In a minute.
All right they got water, orange juice, and what looks like cider.
Hey!
Whoa! Okay. Yeah well, who-who was in World War I?
What?
Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her.
I can hear you!
No, I'm not! And it wasn't a hop it was a pademarie.
Well... I'm helping out down at the N.Y.U. Med School with some... research.
You knew about that?
Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love.
Yeah. Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?
Great! Thanks, Rach!
Dude, you just described seven days worth of stuff. You've got to spread it out a little, you know. Haven't you ever been unemployed?
Hello? What are you talking about? The audition's not 'til 5:00! Well, nobody told me! Who'd you talk to? Nevermind!
I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her.
Hey! Samboucha Margarita?
Oh, yeah.
Look, we are not gonna...
Yeah, I... I don't want Stevie to see her like this.
Hey!
Lookin' good Mr. Cotter.
Well, I'm sorry. I thought parents were coming! Y'know? Your parents are comin'! Chandler's parents are comin'! Ross's parents are comin'!
What award are you practicing for?
Well, I figured we're in another country, so it doesn't count.
He-he-eyy.
Yes! Didn't you ever read Sports Illustrated?! No! I didn't read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!
Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again. And-and I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready. You really think I'm ready?
Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my shot, and I blow it!
Ahhh!
Uh, yeah, okay. Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to get ready.
Yeah, I guess, but what's like heads and what's tails?
Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step.
Goo, goo, goo, waaah!
Yeah, I've had it.
That's right.
What are you guys doing up?
Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!
Had the beef-tips, huh?
Hey Rach.
Come in. Thanks for comin' back, umm, okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and you are one of the finalists!
But Phoebe, wait! Wait! Phoebe. Phoebe!
Alright, alright, hey y'know fair is fair, if you're right, you're right, what can I say, but hey oh no!
That's right! And what are you not gonna do?
Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.
Ah.
I don't wanna.
Hey!
Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...
What the heck is that?
I know...
Hey, y'know what a really good rainy day game is?
Hey!
Because, I know what I like and what I don't like! It's not the same thing!
All right. But if you weren't my best friend.
But you haven't even heard the chorus!
Okay, uh Pheebs, quick. Look! This is for the babies to look at someday, so is-is there anything you want to say? Y'know before it all starts?
Yeah-eh-eah! Oh-oh, sorry, I-I knew what he meant.
No, only for sex.
It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.
Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now, you're gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the landlord.
This will just be my batch.
Thursday's clearly not good for ya, pick a day!
Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? You know, as friends?
Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did.
Okay! Look-look-look, uh, if you're gonna be moving in with him I feel it's my responsibility to tell you the truth about him! Okay? He's a terrible roommate! Terrible! He uh, forgets to umm... Oh-oh he always, he always umm-Oh, who am I kidding! He's the best roommate ever!
That thing was a hazard! I'm very safety conscious.
And you're not supposed to be gossiping!!
All right, I'm gonna go say hi the chick and the duck.
Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it.
Hey.
Ugh, I cannot wait to ask her out!
Me?! Oh come on, man! You can't do this! Come on! I'm your hand twin!!
The airport?
Yeah, yeah. We went to a Mets game, we got Chinese food, and you know, I love this woman. You have got competition buddy.
Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear..
I just wanted to come by and y'know, wish you good luck on your date.
What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's furniture has got Rachel coodies?
Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.
Nooo. No, no, ah, are you sure it wasn't something that sounded like Ginger, like ah, Gingeer?
Like this.
I can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'.
Someone like an...angel?
Whoa!
Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right...
Ohh great!! Hello.
Theres the waitress. Excuse me, Miss. Hello, Miss?
Ye-ye, we go to yours!
Look-look-look you guys, I need some help! Okay? Someone is going to have to convince my hand twin to cooperate!
Her answer machine?
Oh, absolutely! You're talented and you're good looking.
No you're not! Not to me!
Yeah! I don't want you on the trip!
What?!
Fine!
I got one. Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married?
Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, "Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg."
Got it! So...
Oh, I'm gettin' heat from the guy in the hot pink thong.
No reason, I'm just saying that uh... That's where I'll be.
I guess.
Power saw kinda got away from me there.
No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
Like what?
Chandler's wearing panties.
Whoa, dude, look out! You almost crushed my hat!
I dont know. I like her, you know. Shes different. Theres uh, somethin about her.
Yeah! And hey, thanks for coming with me. And thanks again for helping me take a shower.
Hey!
Really? To what?
Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy direct Burger King commercials?
Hey.
Chandler.
Okay.
A swimmer!
Oh! And so the miracle of life begins, and aaiiyyyeeee!
Yeah, it's mine.
Whoa, wait, Pheebs, wait a second! Don't you wanna stay here and talk about it?
Who cares? You're Rachel! Who's Kip?
Hi!
Oh! Oh!
Who's your friend? He's hot!
Hey.
Yeah, and there won't be a relationship left to rebuild.
Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again?
Get out!!
Okay! How you doin'?
Monica, relax, go get a beer.
Come on man! You've been here all day!
Oh my God, is she going back to him?
What else?
I'm sure it's a famous watering can, okay. But, come on...and what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom?
It's not that bad.
What? Me having a job?
Lean-lean-lean!
Ah yeah-wait a second now! Look we're gonna have to set a spending limit on the date. I don't have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.
Hey!
Hey.
All right, I'll see you guys.
Ah.
That sounds perfect!
What are you doing?
Oh that's nice. Happy birthday Rachel, here's some goo.
Well, I know what I'm giving you for Christmas.
All right look, y'know how-y'know how when you're dating someone and you don't want to cheat on them, unless it's with someone really hot?
Uh, listen I gotta double check for tickets tonight. Who-who got what?
Ohh!!
You cuddled.
I ended up at Ross's place. Oh, I musta missed counted or something. Damn! She's not there anymore. Oh, l-l-look, Ross is doing his 'Watching TV' bit.
And that's just in the city. I get her up to 160 when I take her upstate.
That's-ah what I suspected-ah.
Maybe he could slip her the tongue.
Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn't the hair straightener that started the fire. No-no, it was the candles. It's very not good leaving candles unattended. In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is... Uhh... Uhh... Okay. Well, I have to go now.
And there it is.
How you got three women to marry you, I'll never know.
He's talking to London!
Whoa, I didn't know we could date your sister!
All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesn't mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise you're just an idiot in a box!
Rachel, there you are! Come on, let's serve that dessert already!
Ah, are you okay?
Oh, and guess what, I got an audition for All My Children.
Exactly.
These'll go great in my new place. You know, 'till I get real ones.
Oh-whoa, what party?
Who you what? Who you what?!
Look, I don't know why the kids need a youth center anyway! Y'know? They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine!
So that's it? It's over? Just like that?
I know!
You pushed him!
No! No! I can't! You gotta get me out of it! I've got plans! Important plans!
Oh!! Shrimp toast!
Hey! Any good mail?
Ross, how could you let this happen?
All right that's it, school is in session!
Look! Oh! Is that the Pope?!
Okay uh, look I know you're a great actor, okay? And you play all those Shakespeare guys and stuff...
Yeah, what-what's going on?
Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.
Chandler loves marriage!!
How do you figure?
Look, come on you guys, you said you were gonna try! All right look, I came over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and Janine.
We have a half hour.
Why?
Uhh, I'm guessing the threshold's clear now.
So, you're just Bing?
Hey! It's Porsche!!
Hey!
Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?
Well, I figured we're in another country, so it doesn't count.
Damnit Carl!
Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green.
Yeah, I didn't know you guys were going to be here.
No. Rosita does not move.
Wow, it's really long.
Uh, I don't know. Ya see, it's just, see I was a regular on a soap opera y'know? And to go from that to this, I just... Plus, I'd have to wait on all my friends.
What a phony.
Yeah, she's gonna live with me!
That's weird!
First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just make stuff up!
You can't do anything!
Not like him, per-se, just not un-like him.
Bwah-hah-hah!
Okay, take it easy.
46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states?
They do!
When's that?
C'mon show us what you bought. . . You know you want to.
Your sister stood me up the other night.
Everybody smile! Okay, thanks a lot! Enjoy your stay at Caesar's! We hope it's toga-rrific! Kill me. Kill me now.
God, it's gonna so weird like when I come home and you're not here. Y'know? No more Joey and Chan's. No more J and C's. "You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler's?" "Can't, its not there."
It certainly is a miracle.
London baby!!
I meant female nudity. Alright? I don't need to see Lou Grant frolicking.
Aww. Ohh!
Dude you said, "No!"
Hey!
Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket.
Yeah lady! Give us candy!!
What?!
Okay.
Oh, yeah, he rode the bus today.
I'll get it.
Hey! You guys! Remember that audition I had a while ago and didn't get the part?
Well actually...
I don't know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell 'em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.
Yes! Shame about you man.
Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. All right, when was 1990?
You spit on me man!
You could drink the fat.
That's right baby.
Yeah, I thought I was pretty good too.
See you later, Gene.
Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross's behalf. I-I think the rule applies here y'know, since she has a chance to get on broad back...
Hey!
Ahh!
How?! When?!
I'm 30!
Oh, yeah, totally! That's such a turn-on!
Really?
Hi, how ya doing?
Or, I could just point to it! Huh? Blah, blah, blah, Purina One, point to a bag today. I didn't get it, did I?
Hey!
Hey!
Hey. Uh, can I talk to you for a second? This, uh, kid in this picture. Do you, uh, know this kid? Is that like a relative or something?
Hey! Hiya!
Set....hike!
Hm-mmm.
Oh, what about that thing he did when he tipped the guy who showed us to our seats. You never even saw the money, it was like this. Hey Chandler, thanks for showing us to our seats .
What the hell's the matter with you?! This is my favourite jersey.
Yeah, sure, spread some of that on there.
You don't think I know that!
Yeah, there's this superintendent's dance, the Super Ball. I don't know, and he wants to impress Marge, this lady super that he's a crush on.
Good evening. I'm Mr. Tribbiani. And I will be teaching acting for soap operas. Now um, on my first day as Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives, I learned that one of the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting again, it means, you don't have a line, but someone else just did. And it goes like this. Thanks, thanks, a lot. Oh, by the way, before I forget to work in soap operas some of you will have to become much more attractive. All right, moving right along.
Nope.
Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier!
I'm Joey! I'm an actor! I don't know squat about dinosaurs!
Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture-I didn't have my camera!
Done!
There's a lost and found? My shoe!
Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle. Y'know like you guys were doing last night. So, that's it. I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out.
Hey, how did you do that?! Come on in.
Yes sir! Yes sir, I'm-I'm-
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no... It's okay, I mean I-look Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday's thing, but we don't have to do that!
That is incredible! You are the master!
Home is Home Star stew.
Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat.
Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can't figure it out! I talk to you and nothin'. You look at me, and it's nothin'. Nothing.
Aw, man I'm sorry . This must be very tough for ya, huh .
It's Joey.
We didn't ruin it!
Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.
Hey-hey come on you guys, give him a break. Ross, seriously, how's it going with her?
Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there! That was my agent. My agent has just gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie!
Hello Mr. Bing...I love you.
'Kay!
This sucks man! The last night you're here and I lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500.
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! You just take a big, big swing. Now, don't hold back. and Phoebe picks up a wooden baseball bat and starts to swing as Chandler and Monica enter.)
You guys are messin' with me, right?
That's so sweet. I'm gonna get some coffee.
They sent me today's script! They never send the script!
Yes.
What?
Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.
Yeah!
"...by doin' it."
Hey!
Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.
Hey, are you unsupporting me again?
Oooooh!
Hey, are you cool with this. I mean, I don't want to leave you high and dry.
All right!
Yaaaay!
Bob? Who the hell's Bob?
Hey Rach.
Well, he's gonna. I'll see you a little later, ok? Hey, how ya doin'?
Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!
Hey-hey, I'm not judging.
No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.
Thanks! Yeah, there's pulp in that.
'Kay!
That's uh, scenes from next week's show. Next week's!
Okay. Have a benefit.
Okay. Okay, I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a little 'til they get there?
Whoa-ho-ho! Yeah, okay.
They're gonna do it together.
Yeah!!!
Oh.
Yeah, not it here it isn't.
It's never gonna happen.
Oh, uh, okay, how, how about now?
Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't you guys?
Umm?
What? I have seven Catholic sisters. I've taken care of hundreds of kids. Come on, we wanna do it, don't we?
Yeah, hi. You guys got any of those baby chicks? 'Cause I was watching this ah, commercial on TV and man, those guys are cute!
Now? You want me to go over there now?
Aaaaagggghhhhh.
What's wrong buddy?
Aww, man, he took the five of spades!! Oh, no-no-no, here it is!
Hey. I just got off the phone with Estelle and guess what. I GOT THE LEAD IN A MOVIE!!!!!!
That's all right. Hey you guys, you know what's going to be great about the fishing trip this year? When my dad gets me out in the middle of the lake and gives me that, "Joey, what are you doing with your life?" stuff. I can say, "Well, I'm doing a movie with Charlton Heston dad. What are you doing with your life?"
I gotta do what I gotta do, you gotta do what you gotta do, you just do it.
What's the big deal, sit somewhere else.
Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn't get it?
Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, Days of Our Lives. That's actually on television.
Now that you're a couple, we don't get two presents from you guys?
Well check it out, I was with this really hot girl who just moved in right across the street!
Sure. So how long you been...
Ahhh...... Eh?
The Red Ross! Okay.
Totally! I would love to spend New Year's with you.
Hey-hey dancer girl! Can I go to the bathroom? I just.. Here we go. Looking good Gellers!
No.
Yeah. Well, so far yeah. But it's tough you know? I got all this built up flirting energy and I don't know how to get rid of it. How you doin?
Oh! Wait-wait! Is it my bologna sandwich?
Yes!! Ha-ha!! All right! Hey! How cool would it be if you could watch like a real life-sized version of this? Huh? I mean how crazy would that be?
Oh yeah, I always picture your Mom when I'm having sex.
Hi, yeah, it's me. Oh, no no no, we're just friends. Yeah, I'm single. 25. An actor. Hello?
Wow, what-what do you think she wants?
Very good! Okay. G.
Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?
Yep.
You went through my personal property?
Well, we're, we're just goin' over here so that we can get away from the horrible flesh eating virus, for the love of God woman, listen to me. Is he lookin', is he lookin'?
Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?
What you do mean?
I-I-I don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, Ross is right back there.
Hey!
Call it even?
Hey Ross, I'm aware of what I owe.
Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, it's gonna start a little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?
Uh, well they might be a little mad at me over there.
Yeah, the man wreaks! Smells like he went on a three day fishing trip and then ate some liquorice.
Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, I'd better go.
Yeah! No?
Not anymore. So anyway, how do you want to pay me?
You wanna eat? My treat!
I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.
YEAH!!! YES!!!
Pastrami.
Hi, uh, I'll be reading for the role of Mercutio.
Hat, milk, got it.
No, no. He said "When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?"
Yeah, I know!!!!
Yeah?
I don't know! I haven't totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.
Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya!
Marcel?
No! All right, who-who makes up the questions?
Good luck, man.
Well look, I'm breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra padding. Y'know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?
Yes! Yes! Unreasonable!
Oh, let me get this. These are for you.
How young is young Ethan? Young?
So let me get this straight. If you go with Bonnie tonight, you're doing the smart, healthy thing and moving on.
You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica.
If you don't do it, I will.
Hey!
He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food.
Wow thanks!
Hey, Pheebs!
Oh, here's where I win all my money back!
Ross!! We're having a surprise party for Rachel!!
Soon, soon, I'm gonna be on soon. There I am!
Hey Estelle, listen...
I don't get it. What happened? What about everything you said under the bridge?
Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I like you. I-I really do, I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat.
Noo-no-no, no, those are nicknames. I'm the chick and Chandler is the duck.
We all hate Emily!
That's not what I said. Okay, I just meant...
You got a better idea?
See, now it's weird again.
Don't you see what this means?! I can forget about that stupid movie. I'm gonna be a millionaire!
No, can we get back to me?
C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all.
The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limes-Hey, what was in that brown jar?
Yeah.
Ms. Monroe... Oh there you go.
Hey Rach, do you smell smoke?
Dude, I'm telling ya! I'm fine!
Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt!
Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?
No-no-no-no-no we came together!
Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!
I don't know! It's not like it's porn! This is a serious, legitimate movie. Y'know? And the nudity is really important to the story.
Don't you think I asked him that before he got in?!
Well, maybe he's, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy.
Oh-Wha-Ho! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note!
So uh, what's your name?
Ah whatever!
Monica-Monica-Monica-Monica, listen-listen, listen, listen, would-would it make you feel better if we all stop talking about Ross and Rachel.
Over the line?! You-you're-you're so far past the line, that you-you can't even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
It's 4:30.
Ross, hey, the band's ready outside for your first dance with Emily, so...
Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didn't know there.
My scones.
Phoebs, that's OK. You took a big step today.
Oh! Hey, somebody left their keys. Ooohh, to a Porsche! Hey Gunther, these yours?
Oh my God! How many of these things did you have? These are pure vodka.
Or?
Dude!
I, um, can't tell you.
Hey! Tag's still talking to the police.
Yeah.
Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.
Oh... Yeah, you do.
Nope.
Cool.
But you said one.
Look Rach, wasn't this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff?
Nothing, I'm just practicing blowing you off because I'm gonna be a big movie star!
I figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat!
Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure our personalities match. Okay, so I made up a little test. Now, I'm gonna say a word and then you say the first thing that comes to mind.
Okay!
Ew, you get thrown from a horse into an electric fence.
That's mean! You really had me going there!
Hey!

Oh yeah, sure, that makes sense. Yeah. 'Cause you already told her you love her and she didn't say it back, then she called you and told you that there's another guy, so yeah, go to London that'll scare her!
Hey-hey, Ross?
You just give him a spoon baby!
Come on baby, don't go. Please? What do you say?
Why don't you ask Chandler, 'cause he's the one that fooled around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that true? Or are you just gettin' over Janice by groping my sister.
Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you'd be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!
Maybe he's. . . gay.
Ugh! I don't know what I'm going to do! I called the company that sent and th-they don't care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn't an emergency, then what is?
Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell. Now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?
It looks like a women's purse.
...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
Oh, I don't know.... Yeah, can't do it.
What, like there's a rule or something?
Hi! You uh, movin' in or movin' out?
Okay, all right.
Well knock it off, you're supposed to be my friend.
And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
Probably Monica and Chandler.
Days Of Our Lives. Anyway, you're not gonna believe it! My character is coming out of his coma!!
So, Ross and Rachel got married, Monica and Chandler almost got married, do you think you and I should hook up?
Okay, may I see the comics?
Hey-hey-hey you made it!
How could this happen to me?! Yesterday I had two TV shows! Today, I got nothin'!
I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler.
Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?
No-no, no! We have to move the table into my room, yeah! 'Cause of all the boxes. Come on!
Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch.
Dude! He's right there!
Oh man, she's so smokin, she has got the greatest set of. . . no guys around, huh.
Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I'm gonna do that.
Yeah.
So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
You sure? Some extra crispy? Dirty rice? Beans?
Yeah! Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch!
Hey!
This is clearly in the wrong apartment.
Aww, you guys are so cute!
Thanks!
Good, me too. Eggs and milk are in the fridge. Thanks.
Oh, it's Ross's bachelor party.
Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you.
Yeah, maybe it's like y'know, that jock thing. Y'know how football players pat each other after touchdowns.
Get out your checkbook, mister.
Oh come-look, when I was a kid my dad's company gave season tickets to the number one salesman every year, all right? My dad never won! Of course, he wasn't in the sales division, but still, I never ever, ever forgot that!
What's the matter, Pheebs?
Done!
No.
Yeah.
No, not really. They give you all the information, it's uh, it's like memorizing a script. "And on your left, you have Tyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period.
Ben! Ben! Ben!
Yeah well next thing you know, he'll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!
Check this out. Can I have this?
Morning!
She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think.
Okay, look I'm sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldn't have, but you got porn!
Yeah!
Well, hey I did learn.
Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat.
A four and a nine.
Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.
Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I...
What do ya say? What do ya say?
I knew I shouldn't have mentioned it! That's what I wanted to name my kid!
No, seriously.
Yeah.
And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be like, 'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'
Well, safer. Y'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining, without making sure we've got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know.
What is the matter with you?!
Hey, Phoebe, I asked you, and you said it was okay.
Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy , and that guy . And that one-Dude! They're all huge!
And you'll be topless?
I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is the greatest sandwich in the world!
Man, do you know what guys want!
No no, uh, don't thank me for comin' in. Uh, at least let me finish. Uh, we could take the expressway but uh, this time of day you're better off taking the budge. You were goin' for the word bridge there weren't ya. I'll have a good day.
Have you been here all night?
Ahh-oy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right Monica?
Hi.
What if we have to pee?
Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it.
Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
Hey listen, I'm sorry about what happened. . .
Whoa-whoa, what is it?
Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!
Y'okay, Phoebe?
Yeah well we should order some food then.
I'm movin' out like we talked about.
Will you hurry up? Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janine's friends are dancers?! And that they're going to be drinking alot!?
Kinda.
No.
Uhhh, I was an impulse buyer, near the register.
Okay listen, how are you gonna ask her?
All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.
Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can't figure it out! I talk to you and it's nothin'. You look at me, and nothin'. Nothing.
All-all right! Start it up! Let's go!
Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run!
And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
Oh, classy.
What?
All right, how about the ladybugs?
Hey!
No! Not unless! Look this must end now!
Oh my... How much do you weigh Ross?!
I don't feel like talkin.
Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious.
No! No. But ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything in there.
How ya doin'?
Hey, you're not Kip!
Oh right great! Welcome aboard!
Oh you should, it's great.
That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?
You got it! Oh-oh!
I can do an English accent?! That baby's going on my resume!
Holden McGroin.
Oh, no no, that's the beauty part, it goes with everything. You put this on, you're good to go. Ohhh man, you are so wearin' that bracelet.
Oh, so you're playing Adrienne, huh?
What?!
What are you talking about?! I'm the lead in a movie!
Come on, they're close.
Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it!
I'm not answering that.
I think we gotta end the freeze out.
Check out the rack on this chick!
How little are they? I mean, are they like scary little?
This is how much we pay for electric?!!!
Are you kidding? I love that guy! Morning's here! Morning is here-
Well, I'm just-if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!
Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate.
Home sweet home, huh? Nice to, uh, get back to reality. Plus we know how the New Year's gonna go off. I guess there's no reason for all that Y2K panic, y'know? Anyway, g'night!
Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani!
Thank you. Cha-ching! Oh, well hello Mr. Lincoln. Better luck next time buddy. And the drinks are on me!
Uhh, Monica?
Hey Phoebs, if you want, I'll do it.
I know I don't have too! It tastes good.
Good.
No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.
No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.
Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.
It's not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally--Owww!! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right? Well he just told me that he's not entirely happy.
All right, look I'm sorry you guys, but it's just that I gotta get these new head shots made. And they're really expensive, y'know? I'm down to like three! Well, actually two 'cause one of 'em I kinda blackened in some teeth-Why did I do that?!
Phoebe, that's crazy. When I first met you, you know what I said to Chandler? I said, "Excellent butt, great rack."
Oh hey come on, don't-don't-don't do this! Umm, look let-let me tell you something, okay? Now when I watch you do a scene, I'm thinking, "Boy, she-she is a great actress!" Uh but-but, I am also thinking, "She is hot!"
Well, no not yet. But the audition went really good.
Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!
A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That's the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?
It's between us and the sea, Ross!
Oh wow! You can tell this soon.
Look, when everyone eats that...that...Banana-Meat thing, they're all gonna' make fun of her, do you want that?
All right, you're right. I'll talk to her.
No! Hey no! This is wrong you guys! Phoebe's our friend! Well, I'm not gonna watch it!
Cool.
Yeah, you're great! Okay, let's take it from...
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! We have a winner!
So uh listen, I think I'm gonna take off now.
Excellent.
It's not what you think, that was...
So, you and Angela, huh?
All right! Westminster Abbey! Hands down, best Abbey I've ever seen. Hey! Okay. What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?
Have you kissed her yet? It's awesome! I could do it forever! Y'know what? She-she kisses better than my mom cooks!
All you want is a dingle, What you envy's a schwang, A thing through which you can tinkle, Or play with, or simply let hang...
No, it's not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let you down!
But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!
But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game.
There y'go, kids.
Monkey lover!
Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!
Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you Chandler.
No. Really?
Whoa!
You're kidding!
Ah, Gunther, I can't pay for this right now because I'm not working, so I've had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin' for stuff.
Hey!
What?! All right-Hey! Don't look at me! You're the one who wanted to come up and look for some stupid Burger King comet!
Yeah!
Okay.
Hey.
I don't know Ross, not if you're gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist.
What's not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Gooooood.
Hey no, seriously, I don't need you to pick me... Alright! It still works.
Hey.
That's right, all the ladies want to stay at Joey's.
Dude, I am sorry about what I said!
We have a winner!
Why isn't that valet back with my Porsche?
Oh, you have no idea. And-and when we're on stage I get to-to kiss her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it's like somebody's ripping out my heart!
London baby!!
No! No! I-I can do it one more time! See? Look! Hmm, noodle soup. Damnit!
She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it.
Great, well, I'm happy for ya. Alright that's it. He just comes in here, Mr. Jonny Neweggs, with his, his, his movin' the mail and his, his 'see ya pals'. And now there's no juice. There's no juice f or the people who need the juice and want the juice. I need the juice.
See ya!! What the hell was that?!
Sure, it looks stupid now, there's no music playing.
Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man, it's a great part. Look, check it out. I'm the lead guy's best friend and I wait for him in this bar and save his seat. Listen-listen. 'I'm sorry, that seat's saved.'
Everything on your application looks really good-Ohh! Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?
Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad....
Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?
What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant.
You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?
Does a good teacher say, "Put down the beer pinhead!?"
Okay.
The part I want to audition for is a fireman, this is so meant to be!
This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married?
Okay, is there anything else?
Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!
You do?
We love you, man.
Yeah! You...you were wonderful.
For just you?
Well, the part's mine if I want it.
Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.
Well uh, I had breakfast here so technically I saved $3.50.
Let me see. Oh, right.
No way! It's mine!!
Yeah, I'm an actor.
Y'know, there's two women dude.
Dude! I am trying to sleep!
Sure?
That's not gonna work out! Then she's gonna come home all weepy and you'll be tellin' her, "Oh that's okay. You'll find someone." And then, bamn! She finds you!
I don't know. I mean I like her a lot, and she's really nice, but...
All right, it won't go down any further. It's stuck.
Well if it's free food, how come you're charging me for it?
Look we've got to find her. Phoebe just called!! Rachel's coming to tell Ross she loves him!!
What, are you crazy? You haven't beaten me once since my injury plagued '97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.
I'm surprised you didn't go home wearing your lunch.
Uh, four.
How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?
You don't know how long we're gonna be in here! We may have to repopulate the Earth.
So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?
Yeah!
I'm Joey Tribbiani.
Hey!!! Oww!! And I'm bleeding.
Uhh, excuse me is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table?
I want this part so much! Y'know? If I don't get this part I'm never gonna eat Macaroni and Cheese again!-No, I didn't say that! That's a lie.
Oh! Hey right! Not a problem. I totally understand. You need to y'know make sure I don't have any horrible scars or tattoos. Don't you worry; I have nothing to hide. So there you go, that's me. One hundred percent natural! I tell ya, that has never happened before.
They actually said that?
Because it's faster.
What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you?
I know. Yeah.
Hey, imagine if I never got fired off Days Of Our Lives! Oh-hey, there's Carol again!
Since then?!
That is so not my motto.
Oh don't listen to him, he's just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don't think he's gonna get it.
How come Richard looks so much cooler with one of these than me?
Uh, yeah but uh, I may have said those things before but, I never truly meant them. Until now.
Of course I did.
I came over here to tell you guys.
What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?
I bet 'ya ya I could fit in there.
You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?
Oh no-no-no, you don't understand...
Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.
Oh, yeah.
You bet I do! I just ah, wasn't listening then, that's all.
I like it!
We're 29, we're not women.
Any one of the brilliant actresses nominated for this award tonight deserves to take it home. Unfortunately only one can. The nominees for Best Supporting Actress are from Passions Erin Goff. From One Life to Live Mary Loren Bishop , from All My Children Sarah Mchann, and from Days of Our Lives Jessica Ashley. And the winner is......Jessica Ashley from Days of Our Lives. Uh, unfortunately Jessica couldn't be with us tonight so I'll be accepting this award on her behalf. And I'm sure that Jessica would like to thank my parents who always believed in me. She'd also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Ross, Phoebe, and Rachel who's sittin' right there!
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find...
He-he-he, how's it goin'?
Tequila!!
I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday.
What about me?! You-you just said I could!
You really think he'd take me? I mean, we had a pretty good talk last night but, when I moved out, I hurt him bad.
Yeah! Look!
You really think so?
Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...
What's going on?
Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?
Oh, now I have to go!!
Hey! Ah!!
Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?
All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?
Damnit!
...look both ways before you cross the street.
Whoa-whoa-whoa! You're not gonna use the pay phone to call work, are ya?
