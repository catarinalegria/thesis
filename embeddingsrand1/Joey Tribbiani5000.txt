Hey, whaddya wanna do for dinner?
Yeah! Yeah!
Y'know what I think? I think somebody's got a little crush on Casey. How 'bout I fix you two up? What do you think?
Oh, well think of it like this, when you're 90...
You guys don't think I look 19?
Hey Robert, could you ah, ha, pass me those cookies?
And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don't fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they'll start listening to all the nice things I've been saying about you.
Yeah, hey hey, Happy Thanksgiving everybody!
Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.
All right.
Wow! Yeah I ah, I gave up a job too.
Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.
Oh, yeah, he rode the bus today.
All right. Hey, but it better make me look really, really good. Oh, and another thing, the video camera? Nice!!
Can I come?! I won't even talk! You'll just hear the noise from my video camera.
If you want, I'll sell my friends and use the money to buy you presents.
Of course I'm jokin'! I don't take checks.
Dude-dude-dude!
Sure, what do you want to see?
Would you let it go Ross. It was just a dream. It doesn't mean...
Maybe he could slip her the tongue.
What?
No! Hey no! This is wrong you guys! Phoebe's our friend! Well, I'm not gonna watch it!
No, smile! Not that face, smile! Everybody smile!
I'll be playing Drake Remoray's twin brother, Stryker!
What the heck is that?
Thank you.
Yeah, you're roommate is a soap opera star.
Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that and that he'd better come up here and apologize. I'll see you later.
Well, these really are the days of our lives.
All right, I'll take a box of the cream filled Jesus's.
Okay, fine, I will bring you a tape, huh?
I'm the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!
I'm 30!
Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! It's like the end of an era! No more J-man and Channie's!!
And you'll be topless?
I'm Joey Tribbiani.
Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?
Hey guys! Look who's back! It's Ray-ray!
You could?
He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew! You think we could get a bathtub in our kitchen?
It's me, Joey!
Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.
I think you're right.
Ross, did you really read all these baby books?
I got this pair marked excess, I gotta tell ya, there was no room for excess anything in there.
Awww, man! He promised he wouldn't take the chairs!!
You do?
Aww, you guys are so cute!
Get him a bone, get a bone. You gotta bone?
No I'm not. Why would you say that? That's just mean.
Wow, that was kinda brutal.
All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty.
What do you mean?
Boy, it was so hard not to laugh, I tell ya. Hey, hey, the place looks great!
Thanks Ross.
Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It's like Ross not likin' ice cream.
Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet!
Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!
Come on! Do something!
This is your place?
I know, it was the best I could get out of them.
Hard to tell, I was naked.
No-no-no-no-no! It's a surprise, but it's gonna be tricky thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.
Hi!
Nothing.
Please don't kick Monica and Rachel out, this wasn't there fault, it was mine.
You wanna see her again, right?
So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe... huh-huh?
Hey. Uh, can I talk to you for a second? This, uh, kid in this picture. Do you, uh, know this kid? Is that like a relative or something?
Whoa! This guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town! Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition!! I mean, way to go Ben! Man! I've been in that park a million times and no one offered me an audition.
Yeah, it's mine.
Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? You know, as friends?
Hey.
Hey, where are you going?
Hey.
Your sister stood me up the other night.
3, 2,
Nana?
Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job.
Ahh, yes.
Yeah.
Was the chord at least right...
Movies?
Put your hands together.
Whadja think?
I don't know. But I can see through your sheet. Yeah, yeah, that's her. But y'know what? Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway.
Yeah. Okay. Ross's treat! Where do you wanna eat?
Oh, 'cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom, there's your admirer.
Uh, well, kinda yeah. Like, remember last week when Alex was in the accident? Well the line in the script was, 'If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to die.' But I made it, ' If this woman doesn't get to a hospital, she's not gonna live.'
Thank God!
Well Ross was hangin' out over at our place, Rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from Chandler....
Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey!!
Well, it was a fight. . . based on serious stuff, remember. About how I never lived alone or anything. I just think it would be good for me, ya know, help me to grow or. . . whatever.
Yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck got sick!
Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, Days of Our Lives. That's actually on television.
Ross good, I'm uh glad you're here. I wanna talk to you about something.
Miracle!
He's back! The peeper's back!
And you're not supposed to be gossiping!!
Look, it was a job all right?
Hold on, you-you knew?
'Sup? 'Sup dude?
Okay. Hey uh, when do I get to meet the robot?
No-no-no! No-no wait Rach, you know what would even be more fun? Telling them.
You guys promised you'd be more careful! I mean, come on! The good Joey name is being dragged through the mud here!
Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction...
Uh, Pheebs, you're leaking?
Hey!
Here we go! Here we go! Here we go! How you doin'?
Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant.
Okay.
You can pee here!
Ahh, forget about it, I'm havin' a ball. How's the apartment doin'
Yeah!
I'm Joey! I'm an actor! I don't know squat about dinosaurs!
I think so.
Hey-hey-hey!
Boy that Julie's a talker, huh?
Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7.
Chandler? A word.
What?
No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. Hey, Angela.
You want me to lie to Chandler?
I think I left a donut up here.
So what're you guys gonna eat?
Ross. I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape.
Don't stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!
I can't believe she would say that too you.
Fine, make fun. I think it's jaunty.
Hey, it's gonna be all right.
You know you've been spitting on me?!
I've got cold feet.
Dude! He's right there!
You don't think I know that!
Hmm that's weird. I don't remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.
That's weird!
Ahh, to be 13 again.
Oh my.
What-what's so funny?
I guessed 20,000!
Ross! Ross! If you're going to the airport, could you pick me up another one of those Toblerone bars?
Hello!
Is he gonna be ok?
Thanks, yeah. I love this but ya know what, it makes me wanna pee.
So how you two gettin' along?
We did?
No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot.
Hey! Great, you're home! Guess what Phoebe got me for Christmas!
I don't believe this!
OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.
Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still get cake right?
Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.
Are you all right?
So, we're walking down the street and I turn to you and I say, "Hey, let's go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes," remember? And then, and then, you turn to me and say, "Nah, let's just hang out at your place." Well, that was a nice move dumb ass.
Oh, so you're playing Adrienne, huh?
Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat.
So?
And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!
Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room.
But it's dark out.
Oh yeah, yeah, she's great, but... I kinda got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me. And I definitely would get the part if I would've... you know... if I would have sent the Little General in.
Okay.
Ahh, the babies miss me?
That he doesn't exist.
Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman! And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition! Okay, look, if I have to pretend I don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about.
What?! Tonight?!
Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, I'll let you have her.
Kristen Lang.
Hey.
Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man, it's a great part. Look, check it out. I'm the lead guy's best friend and I wait for him in this bar and save his seat. Listen-listen. 'I'm sorry, that seat's saved.'
Ok.
How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!
All right. But if you weren't my best friend.
So, there was no miracle?!
Well I uh, got what I came for. I'll uh, I'll see you guys.
Morning! Hey, how's my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?!
Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again.
Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.
No-no, Kathy.
Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost $1,500 to him in Cups!
Both of us?
Nope, not that one.
Hmm, soup. I mean, noodle soup. I mean soup!
No-no-no-no-no we came together!
No, but if you're willing to cook naked, then you might be willing to dance naked. And then...
It's not what you said. It's the way you said it....Oh My God, I'm a woman!!!
Hold on. Hold on. Rachel coming. Do...Something.
Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're dead! You're gone! You're worm food! ...So Chandler looks gay, huh?
Oh man, she's so smokin, she has got the greatest set of. . . no guys around, huh.
Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual scenarios and stuff huh?!
Well, I've been better. But, I'm all right. So you like her huh?
What's up with Gene?
Oh. Ohh. Ohh, you're out of your mind.
Yeah.
You're in!
Porsche.
Which what?
You guys kissed! Oh my-this is huge!
I think you did.
You're right, you're right, I'll get back to work.
And I know both of them, they're really good. One of them is the guy from those allergy commercials who's always getting chased by those big flowers...
Yeah, y'know at first I thought we could talk about this y'know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don't think I...
Oh, well we watch it a second time and its Die Hard 2!
Hey! Hey!!
No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.
Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.
All right, listen, Ross... you like this girl, right?
Really? Thanks.
See? Eh, wasn't that fun?
Oh well, it's not on TV yet.
Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!
No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross see Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!
Hi, Lauren.
Had the beef-tips, huh?
Wait, here's one. Uh, would you be willing to cook naked?
Well, I think it's ridiculous that you haven't had sex in three and a half months.
What?! Wait-wait-wait! The handsome man was about to enter!!
Okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat.
And what?! Did you sleep with her?!
Aww man! I can't believe I locked myself out again!
I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!
When you're off the phone, do you wanna get a pizza?
Hey, opposite, is opposite!
Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did.
Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??
Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.
What do you like better action or comedy?
Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!
Look I don't know this baby. I don't know if she's a famous artist or not. You know, and I don't want to be a jerk but you're changing too much around here.
All the way to the airport huh? You know that's over 30 miles, that's gonna cost you about so bucks.
Why wouldn't ya? Erin is great! Then-then there's you guys.
Look we've got to find her. Phoebe just called!! Rachel's coming to tell Ross she loves him!!
That's my line! I can take it from here, thanks. Dearly beloved, I'm sorry I'm a little late. You may be confused by this now, but you won't be Memorial Day weekend 2002. Well, let's get started before the groom takes off again. Huh? We are gathered here today, to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. I've known Monica and Chandler for a long time, and I can not imagine two people more perfect for each other. And now, as I've left my notes in my dressing room. We shall proceed to the vows. Monica?
I know.
All right, all right, all right. I mean I'll have to check with him first, but I'll think he'll be cool with it.
Yeah, the other day I was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up. Oh! Which reminds me, I'm also thankful for thongs.
Really, a shower huh? And uh, which-which room might that be?
For Ross.
Uh, boat rope.
Ross, you should know that my pants are startin' to come down and I'm not wearing any underwear!
Hey!
The silk? Feels really good!
Yeah, I guess, but what's like heads and what's tails?
Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.
Yeah, and when you do, he'll be lucky to have you.
Oh! Yeah, look there's this play all right? And I'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse. So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.
Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.
Hey, Paul!
Well, maybe a little. I wish you hadn't seen me throw up.
Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. We're going to a New Year's Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great! Y'know? But if she says 'Dude, what the hell are you doing?' I can say 'It wasn't me, it was New Years!'
Ohh. Wow! Well how-how, how will you be gone?
Yeah, I didn't know that.
Oh, come on Rach! My turn just started!
Oh, just, y'know.... science.
I don't know how to play Cups.
No. Really?
So, assistant to the director. That's a really exciting job, I mean, you must have a ton of cool responsibilities.
And deaf!
Oh my God! I cannot believe you guys are talking about this! The problems in the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! All right?!! Now Chandler is doing the best he can!!
Hey! So I'm back.
I'd say, come again. No-no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this one, uh...
Okay uh, look I know you're a great actor, okay? And you play all those Shakespeare guys and stuff...
Whoa-ho-ho! Yeah, okay.
Yeah.
Ooh, very official.
Ugh! I don't know what I'm going to do! I called the company that sent and th-they don't care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn't an emergency, then what is?
Fortune! This guy is so stupid. It's Count Rushmore!!
Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya. I'm sorry man.
Hi, Rach.
Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this.
Dan just moved in downstairs. Yeah, he just got back from like this four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella.
Say that to him and you're golden.
Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?
I can fix it. Hold on. Look out. Look out.
Hey well, you can't teach someone to be good with women. Y'know, that's why I never had any luck with Chandler.
Come on you guys, come on please-please just give her another chance, huh? She'll come around I promise.
Oh, forget about it. She rocks!
Yes!!
Oh, is today the day you're gonna tell them about you two?
Well, I had a whole ceramic zoo thing goin' over there but now, without the other ones, it just looks tacky.
What?
Isn't it? And it's engraved too, check it out.
Hey, hey, they're runnin'
You kissed him?!
'Kay!
What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?
Hey!
Me too! Me too! Me too!
A handsome man enters. Hey! How's it going guys? I don't know what you two were talking about, but I'd like to say thanks to both of you. You, you wouldn't let me give up on myself, and you well you co-created Fireball. The end.
Because Vincent, we were lovers. For two years!
Oh Monica. Wow, this guy's an astronaut. That would've been cool, for like a day. .
Wh-what?! Why?!
Oh no-no-no! No-no-no-no-no-no-no!
Oh, ha-ha-ha! Ooh! Wait a minute, I used to get medical experiments down on me all the time!
Yeah.
That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that?
Okay. Okay, I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a little 'til they get there?
Just okay-Did you do it right?!
Ok, I got one, I got one. Uh, if he blows into one, does the other one get bigger?
Hi! You uh, movin' in or movin' out?
Okay.
Thanks!
What-what's wrong with Monica and Chandler?
All right, here we go.
She keeps punching me.
Oh that's okay. Hey, actually in a way it's kinda nice. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!
Alright, just one. Wow, you're good at that.
Hey! Y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when we get Chinese food?
Yeah, is Sidney there? Oh, this is? Sidney's a woman.
Ross, how could you let this happen?
"...when I look back over our time together..."
You got it. Okay. Now, I can pass for 19 right?!
Oh, Urse...
Doctor? Wow! I didn't know he had a nickname.
Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you.
The country?
How're you doing?
So what are you doing bringing her here?! There's people here!
Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch.
You went through my personal property?
I wanted to go to the strip club!
Pretty nice?
He can still catch her! Come on, get out of there! Get out of there!
Well, I can't do everything! Look back over your time together.
Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?!
Definitely!
Yeah, well, you don't have your racket.
Hey! Tag's still talking to the police.
That one will.
Well, I think it went pretty well. I.. I got a callback for Thursday.
My whole family's from Naples!
Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling.
Oh, I'm sorry. You wanna bite?
Hey!
Gotcha.
That's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross!
Thank you. Thank you.
Oh, tell me about it. And she's been on the show forever, it's gonna be really hard to fill her shoes.
Oh! Oh-oh, you gotta pick Joey! I mean, name one famous person named Chandler.
No.
Okay.
Yes!
'Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about to-
It's not what you think, that was...
No! He blew us off!
I want the drugs Ross, I want the drugs!
Come on! Who has the biggest boobs?
No you won't.
Nice!
Man you are incredible.
No, in Ross's building! She's back! She's back! Okay, wait there, I'll be over in a second. Got it!
Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.
You've got to pick a pocket or two. Boyyyyssss, you've got to pick a pocket or two..........
Oh man! Now she's gonna start all over! We're never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world!
Wow! Maybe uh, maybe you and I ought to get to know each other a little better.
Hey, dude, let me in. I got a girl out here!
Me too. Alright, whattaya got.
Ooh, I was gonna say bologna, but that's much better. How about a little of that smoked turkey?
Okay. Can I squeeze your ass?
Hey! Are you okay?
And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.
You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?
Warm milk and Excedrin P.M.
Yeah that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if were ever to have kids, well that's a...
Come here.
Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...
No-no-no-no-no, it's-it's uh, you just uh, uh reminded me that uh, I need to do my stretches too.
All right.
Really?
Oh, yeah. He's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head.
Oh hi!
Yeah right after we stole his lunch money and gave him a wedgie. What's the matter with you, he's parking the car.
Yeah, and I'm a little tired from digging the hole.
Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missed my chance.
All right, so... next time, you take her to your place.
Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.
Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors!
Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!
Hey-hey dancer girl! Can I go to the bathroom? I just.. Here we go. Looking good Gellers!
So where you gettin' it?
Oh, hey. Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive you nuts before too, remember?
Yeah. With a bite! Gee-e-e-eez!
Ooh, Ross, look! Look!
Well, thank you. So, can we play 20 Questions now? I've got a really good one! I've been thinking about it since Kansas.
Well, what's it called?
We're now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, "I do" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!
I'm gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
I'm not sure.
Hey you guys! What's happening?
Oh, you have no idea. And-and when we're on stage I get to-to kiss her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it's like somebody's ripping out my heart!
Oh that's on the house courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.
What's the matter with you?!
You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!
Uh, de-clawing cats. Hey, tell ya what. Let me walk you home. We'll stop by every news stand and burn every copy of their Times and the Post.
Why not?
Okay, but I don't see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.
Sure. Yep.
You know, I think I was sixteen.
Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me.
I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.
Whoa, wait, Pheebs, wait a second! Don't you wanna stay here and talk about it?
Thanks!
Hey.
Pheebs, I am so sorry! I know I promised you a fun road trip with your friend and I didn't deliver. But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship! So, so, so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as I know you.
Aaaaagggghhhhh.
Yeah.
Ross! So when is it gonna air?
Yeah.
Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.
Oh-oh!
Oh, so your weekend was a total bust?
Great, you can cover Chandler.
I know, here-here!!
Right this is staging.
Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today.
Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.
Oh, what about that thing he did when he tipped the guy who showed us to our seats. You never even saw the money, it was like this. Hey Chandler, thanks for showing us to our seats .
Lifeguards.
Is it back in the cage?
No! No! No! No! No! How you doin'?! How you doin'-Damnit Carl! Go wait in the hall!
Very funny Ross! Very life-like and funny. Okay. Oh no-no-no, I wasn't waving at you lady. Whoa, maybe I was! Hey, Monica, this totally hot girl in Ross's building is flirting with me.
No-no-no-no-no, I'm not fallin' for that again.
Hey everybody, look who's here! You remember my grandmother!
Marcel?
Vomiting stories are funny...
Whoa!!!
No, look.
Why God?!! Why?!! We had a deal!! Let the others grow old! Not me!!
Yeah may-maybe you don't tell anyone about this.
Oh my God! Those are almost right on the floor!
Well, when Jake did it I saw that...he was wearing women's underwear!
Mine!
Uh Rach, if you're gonna start another story, at least let me finish mine.
I mean if-if you're thinking it's a woman's bag, it's not. It's a man's bag!
That's how they do pants! First they go up one side, they move it over, then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?
Oh-whoa-wait, Gunther don't-don't forget your shirt.
Oh sorry, I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross. Who-who's Barry and Mindy?
Hey, Julie, I didn't know you wore lenses.
Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while!
Say what?
I know! I know! Come on, please-please you guys, don't-don't be mad. I'm sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends! Y'know? And it was our first date! Plus, she's really sick!
So the Porsche guy took his car back.
Take it back?
Well, you gotta give him something that he can't say no too. Like uh, Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you're guaranteed he'll say yes!
And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv-
Havin' some trouble?
Hey, woah, let's go down there and get your hat back.
Fine.
Nope.
Are you naked in there?
Yeah. And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous rock formation.
Well, hey I did learn.
Half the taste is in the smell! You-you're sucking up all the tastiness!
Hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me?
Am I psyched? The lead in my own TV series? I've dreamed about this for years! Why have I not been preparing?!
Uh, well yeah-yeah, I've got all of that going on. Yeah, listen uh, I want you to make sure you tell Chandler that he couldn't have been more wrong! Uh-oh! I gotta go Monica, my uh, my sushi's here!
Yeah! Yeah sure, just long as it's handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold.
Yeah. We figured when we couldn't find you, you'd gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?
Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Y'know? The only problem is, Carl's acting is...
Terrible! I messed up every line! I shouldn't even be an actor!
Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girl...
You guys, can we please not watch this all right.
It-it doesn't?
Too long! Oh my God, Rach, I've been dying to talk to someone about this for so long! Listen, listen, we can't say anything about this to anybody, they're so weird about that! Listen...
But uh, uh, what about uh, Ross and uh. . .?
You couldn't do it?!
So he likes to break stuff.
You got all that from the back of her head?
Yeah, and not put us in the middle.
What, so I gotta shut it down now?
Aw crap! Okay-uh...uh let's-let's do the rings.
Oh! Maybe it's because I'm on television. I'm an actor on Days of Our Lives.
That's it, just hey. Like at the end of a dance, HEY! Hey. He-hey.
Karen.
Hey, how much did you guys tip the super this year?
Uhh, rub it?
Yeah, and oh she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.
Hey! Joey Tribbiani! I'm here! I'm here!
Y'know-y'know what I really want?
I know! I mean it's not like we weren't cool about it.
Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here!
Look, do you want the ring or not?!
Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too.
Whoa-whoa, what is it?
Yeah?
Likewise. Uh, I'll take that. It's what I came for. So, this is new. Where'd you two meet?
Yeah.
Yeah!!
Uh-huh!
G. I. Joe! Cool! Can I play?
Come on Treeger, don't say that. You just ahh, you just need more practice. Here, come on, let's ahh, let's try it again. Come on. Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway. I mean, y'know, I'm not really that comfortable dancing with a- We-he!! Hey!
Oh yeah? And who do you like?
Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there! That was my agent. My agent has just gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie!
Fine.
Alright, you're on. I can take two minutes out of my day to kick your ass.
Yeah! Look!
Somebody wanna help me out here?
I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her.
No I won't.
Yeah, what's up with that Serpico?
Hey.
What party?
Hey, all right!
I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
That's right I stepped up! She's my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, I'd pee on anyone of you! Only, uhh, I couldn't. I got the stage fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh, I turned to Chandler.
You?! And-and you?!
How you got three women to marry you, I'll never know.
Oh no-no-no, you don't understand...
You got porn!
Hey, Ross! What are you doin'?
Nah, I'm too depressed to eat. I'll probably eat in like 5 minutes. So I guess I'll just fly home with you guys, what time's your flight?
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.
Not a problem.
Uhh, cause, uhh, I'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal chokage. Alright, look, I got to tell you something.
You don't know!
Hey!
He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes.
Can we please turn this off?
I can't believe this Chandler!
Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks!
I love you too.
Aww, there we go.
Oh.
Well, how long do you think it'll be?
Yeah but I didn't read anything.
No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her.
Hey! You guys! You're not gonna believe this! I just got off the phone with my agent...
Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it.
There's a lost and found? My shoe!
Uh Cecilia Monroe, she plays Jessica Lockhart.
Really? A purse?
Aw-awww!
I think it's going okay. Looks like he's smiling.
Yeah, you are! I scared you!
Just a, uh... hearing disability.
Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?
Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday?
Hey!
Does a good teacher say, "Put down the beer pinhead!?"
I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone!
What?! He got to do it at your first wedding!
Hey!
Huh? Days of our Lives picked up my option.
Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn.
No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed.
Thanks man.
Well, that-that-that's it? You're gonna, you're gonna put it on your self or anything?
Morning, Paul.
Not in my head.
Hey.
Okay.
I know. And she's so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair.
I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her...
Woah, hey, yo.
Okay!
Huh?
You didn't cry when Bambi's mother died?
I've never slept with someone for a part.
Hey! Get into gear!
No. Y'know how we're always saying we need a place for the mail.
I did. I thought it'd be great. I figured I'd have like, time alone with my thoughts but, ya know, it turns out I don't have as many thoughts as you'd think.
Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads.
Well, the brown one brings out your eyes, but your butt looks great in the blue one.
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah! Enh? All right, what do you think?
I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
Multi-colored robes! Ooh, and maybe a hat.
London baby!
Hey Chandler, do we know that lady?
Really? To what?
She's gone. She had a bag and she left.
Some girl ate Monica.
Oh I am!
What?!
What?
Oh good! Can I tell her?! Can I tell her?!
Okay. "Hey, Timmy, I've got a surprise for you."
No, no. He said "When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?"
Good luck, man.
They didn't fight a lot?
Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island.
Well, he's not used to women being so forward with him; but uh, I good check with him-He says it's okay. Great! Thanks! Bye-bye!
Woah, woah, woah, woah. Which sister?
All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel-Damnit!
Look, I got to apologize on the behalf of Carl.
Hey-hey listen...
What?
Oh my.
Why?
Wow.
I couldn't do it.
Oh uh, well I just came in for a cup of coffee to go.
I don't know. Why? Did you hear something?
Okay, what else?
That's ridiculous!
Gotcha.
In the woods. No wait-wait, that's the joke answer.
Sorry!
So when do we get to meet the guy?
Me too.
Hey.
Ho-ho-ho, fried stuff with cheese!
What?
Okay.
Great, well, I'm happy for ya. Alright that's it. He just comes in here, Mr. Jonny Neweggs, with his, his, his movin' the mail and his, his 'see ya pals'. And now there's no juice. There's no juice f or the people who need the juice and want the juice. I need the juice.
That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!
You guys are messin' with me, right?
Ooh, sorry. Sorry. You finish, go.
Hey guys! I was at the library all morning and I already finished my five pages for today!
Yeah, what' going on?
Oh... Yeah, you do.
Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas....
When's that?
What?!
That's right!
Hey, so how'd it go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart?
What's up?
What are you talking about? Keep it!
Cool!!
Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States.
That's true.
Aww that's nice. Family should be there, huh? This is her wedding, happiest day of her life.
Aww. Ohh!
There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? All right who's first? Huh? Ross?
I couldn't help it, there love is so pure.
I didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok.
Well, I-I might've said supergay.
So, we're having fun, right?
No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Or, or I'm the one who dates her.
Oh-ho, and mine!
Hey, if we know it can we have candy?!!
IN LONDON!!!
Okay, really good. Anyway I gotta go; I'm late for work.
Yeah, sure. Well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography.
Oh. That is quite a situation. Uh, do you see any like, powder?
Hey!
Oh, how bad is it?
Look, I'm telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here it doesn't hurt that bad.
C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit.
I-I-I don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, Ross is right back there.
Maybe you'll order a little sangria?
Hey.
Oh, it's easy. Yeah, I-I can do it with anything. Watch uh, Grandma's chicken salad...
Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!
Hello?
She's right y'know.
Me?
You don't know how long we're gonna be in here! We may have to repopulate the Earth.
I knew that! I sooo didn't know that, but you should see your faces.
I don't know.
It's a name, yeah. I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big pool.
Merry Christmas!
Um, sure! Did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way?
Come on, Chandler, I want this part soo much. Just one kiss, I won't tell anyone.
When do you think we lost her?
Check it out, he's winning! Pete's winning!
What?
Hey, hey, look at that talent.
Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?
You-you have to pay that! It's not just a guess.
Hey, that's never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!
Emily is kinda taking a long time, huh?
Was his name Angus?
Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step.
Hey little buddy, how are you feeling? What the hell is in that face cream? That's so soft. Pillowcases! Zelda looked at the chimney sweep. Her father, the vicar... The vicar? ...wouldn't be home for hours. Her loins were burning. She threw caution to the wind and reached out and grabbed his... Whoa! Whoa-ho-ho-ho! This is a dirty book!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Chandler, Heckles was a nut case.
And you'll be nice?
Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh.
Hey!
Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!
Hey!
All right, all right, all right, all right, you wanna know what I do when I take resume shots?
Thank you!
H-h-h-how's the duck?
What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph.
Oh, you said it Mike. Aw! There's got to be a better way!
Nope-op! I insist! You get the wine right?
Yeah I did!
Yeah. Sorry about that. Oh, hey little girl. Uhh, is-is your mommy, or sister, or babysitter by any chance a hot girl?
Yeah that'd be great! Thanks Pheebs!
Oh thanks. Thanks. It was great meetin' ya. And listen if any of my friends gets married, or have a birthday, or a Tuesday...
Hey! Where have you been?
...I'm his
My Giant? I love that movie!
I figure my character has kids.
Well-well-see? Parents are comin'!
Absolutely! And if it doesn't, can I get the extra ticket?
Oh-ho, you should get inside my head.
I guess I'm done.
Wait a minute.
You cuddled.
No, my first fan mail.
So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that's nice!
How about a scone on the house baby?
No it isn't, I ate that.
Well, since you ask. They want me back on Days of Our Lives!
Okay, all right.
Have you kissed her yet? It's awesome! I could do it forever! Y'know what? She-she kisses better than my mom cooks!
Yeah!
Yeah. You okay?
You got a little bored?
Hey-hey, what's going on?
Yeah.
Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me. Go get me a sweater.
Don't answer that.
All right Phoebs, way to go.
What happens if you flick it?
Die Hard 2.
Well, then it wouldn't be a secret. So yeah, that would be okay. Yeah. Yeah!
I don't wanna give up the bag. I don't have to give up the bag! Do I Rach? Oh, you think I should give up the bag!
Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go together, we're like the three hocke-teers.
What?!
Okay, now the Mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic period.
So what's it gonna be?
Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me.
My scones.
Hey, look, I don't need you getting all judgemental and condescending and pedantic.
Yeah, she broke up with me.
Look, I just need a wire something to jimmy it. Oh hey, one of you guys give me the underwire from your bra!
RACHEL PLEASE!!! JUST HAVE DINNER WITH US!!!
Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room.
Well uh, it's just that uh, y'know if-if you're gonna be wearing someone's sweatshirt shouldn't it be your boyfriends--and I'm not him.
Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000. Can you believe that? $5,000!
Yes! Didn't you ever read Sports Illustrated?! No! I didn't read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!
I don't know, it looks the same.
You know what the. . .
Oh, come on! Have you seen what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he dials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!
Well my old man is doing a plumbing job down there and he heard they have an opening. So, you want me to see if I can get you an interview?
To her parent's I think and she said you shouldn't call her. But if I were you I would.
But I'm the host!
Wh-what's going on?
Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project.
If it's not you, this is a horrible story.
Thank you Phoebe, that is very, very generous.
Wow! Look at this! He wrote a check for 50,000 dollars to Hugo Ligrens Ring Design. Oh, sorry, what do you think the good news is?
Oh my God, quick turn off the TV.
If you don't do it, I will.
Chandler! You are not gonna believe this! I have found my identical hand twin!
Ohhh.
That's uh, scenes from next week's show. Next week's!
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot, or just fall down. That's good too.
Yeah.
I like her so much!
Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off!
Or... just get a card that has a poem already in it.
Whoa!
Yeah, maybe it's like y'know, that jock thing. Y'know how football players pat each other after touchdowns.
Nope.
Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.
So, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you and me and Chandler?
Joey Tribbiani! From the wall! Okay, maybe this will jog your memory, huh? Huh? Okay eh-ah-anyway, I'm ready to go back up on the wall I'm the star of a new TV show.
Shhhh!
This is how much we pay for electric?!!!
I bet that kiss isn't looking like such a big mistake now, is it?
Well, I figured we're in another country, so it doesn't count.
Heads.
Yep, it's fat. I drank fat!
Me too.
There was a seen in Footloose...
Oh, you're Phoebe's fan!
Yeah, they're mine.
No, I'm not! And it wasn't a hop it was a pademarie.
Eight hundred and twelve bucks.
Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job.
Yeah, you're great! Okay, let's take it from...
I didn't get it.
No it's not weird, it's a miracle!
God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?
Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?
Am I in it?
Whoa-whoa-whoa. What ah, what happened to playing the field?
This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married?
Hey man, you feeling any better?
Uh, hey, Dr. Greene, why don't you come with me, we'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed.
And you don't a little good about donating the money?
My chair heels itself.
Uhhh, mine too! Yeah.
Richard told Monica he wants to marry her!
Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.
Hi, how ya doing?
Yeah, there's this superintendent's dance, the Super Ball. I don't know, and he wants to impress Marge, this lady super that he's a crush on.
I gotta do what I gotta do, you gotta do what you gotta do, you just do it.
Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a change. This has gone on long enough.
Oh! Tell her she's not marriage material.
Well, it turns out you were right C.H.E.E.S.E.
No-no-no, no it's uh, it's okay.
Hey, do we do this too much?
No-no-no, that-that's me, that's me.
I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.
Uh... Phoebe? Phoebe?
Can I see the comics?
Twice?
Whoa-whoa! No-no-no-no-no, nothing is going up! Okay? Up, up is not an option-what's a urethra? Are you crazy?!
What?!
No.
Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means?
Hey Ross listen Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend!
You got a better idea?
I'm sorry man, I didn't-I'm-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Yes, it's a highly controversial procedure.
Oh really! Where? Somewhere funny I'd bet!
Oh yeah. Hey! Should we give these shirts to the girls? Y'know, kinda like a peace offering.
OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met.
Well, we're fashioning a very long poking device.
There's my scene, there's my scene. "Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.
I don't know.
Uhh, they're tall.
Kinda looks like that stuff you get when you get a bad infection.
Dad, Ronni's here.
Yeah, in my third drawer on my dresser. You don't want to lose that.
I think I'm gonna take-off.
Yeah?! So's yours!
Soooooo... you are now looking at Dr. Drake Ramore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at least four episodes!
And?
Hey.
You ah, you forgot your shoes.
Anyway, it wasn't the robot, it was the guy who controls him. Yeah, he doesn't like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E. knock over the sandwich right when I was reaching for one! Ohh!
Hey! How you doin'?
In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!
With a man?
I gotta get one, too.
Hey.
Wow.
He forgot to leave his grip size!
Yeah, I can dance, y'know.
Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... Although actually I'm really not that hungry...
Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside.
Ahh!
No, it's okay, but if I'm Marge, my breasts are coming out my back.
Oh, y'know what? Since I'm here, I think I'm gonna have me a little beer on the port side.
They're takin all my stuff back. I guess you were right.
I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it! Look Ross, if anyone should step aside it should be Ben!
What's up man?
Right. Goodbye Erica, good luck in Salem. Take care
Uh, no, she's at dance class.
Well, we were! But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out!
I'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets!
Is there a problem?
Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now.
That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?
That's a really long time.
Street noise drowned any of that out? No, all right, I see you later, okay...
Actually I rent the whole place and, I just got what you meant. Thank you.
Na-uh! Hey did anybody lose their keys?
Suck-fest.
Hey, who wants to ah, throw the ball around a little, maybe get a little three on three going?
Anyway, I started working on what I'm going to say for the ceremony, do you wanna hear it?
Marcel?
No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.
Ye-ye, we go to yours!
I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal.
Noooo!!
Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It's one of my gifts.
Okay.
Something like that?
I still haven't gotten a check for your half yet.
You look good.
No. Rosita does not move.
Hey!
Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! Yeah, my pants are a little loose!
Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want Ross out of the picture.
Yeah. Cushions the blow.
Okay, but let's say there was. How might that go?
Okay.
No reason, I'm just saying that uh... That's where I'll be.
Whoa, I didn't know we could date your sister!
Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again. And-and I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready. You really think I'm ready?
Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl.
Oh. Oh.
Check this out? Huh? Yeah. That's the stuff. What do you think?
I, I don't get you. I mean first, you hate me. Then you sleep with me. Then you want nothing to do with me, now you want me again.
Where are you going? The vicar won't be home for hours.
No-no-no! We gotta go! Come on! Here we go.
I can't believe Ross went out with Rachel's sister! When Chandler made out with my sister I was mad at him for 10 years.
Thursday! Look if you need help remembering think of like this, the third day. All right? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when? Huh? What day? Thursday! The third day! Okay?!
Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.
Why are you doing this?
What's wrong with the twentieth?
It's uh, right through there.
No! No! I-I can do it one more time! See? Look! Hmm, noodle soup. Damnit!
What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!
Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.
Shhh! This is a museum, no talking. Right down here, we have a large foot. Uhh, and over here we have Ross Geller. Everyone wave 'Hi' to Ross. Ross is one of our most important scientists, look at him, hard at work. Okay, moving right along. Come on.
I don't know why you say that so soon.
Ugh!!
Oh, ah- the kid has it.
Dude, if you go back out there, you're gonna be Dead Ross!
All right, how about the ladybugs?
Okay, the last thing...
Oh, hey, Lauren. Uh, you guys this is, this is Kate's understudy, Lauren.
Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. There's no meat in beer, right?
You wanna smell him?
So, you'd hire me, right?
Wow! Sure! That's great!
You knew about that?
I want to go on a ride along!
Oh, you're kidding me! All-all right, well make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes. Okay? I'm an actor; I'm kinda getting my picture up there on the wall.
All right, relax, relax. Just relax, just relax. Be cool, be cool.
Uh.
Hey guys! What 'cha been doin'?
Okay, good, good, good, 'cause, good, 'cause I was kinda having second thoughts too.
Excellent.
Hey.
Whoa, that doesn't necessarily mean that he's breaking up with you.
Heh... I was bluffing.
Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English.
Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.
Ahh.
How ya doin'?
Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...
Yeah!
Come on man, you're not a potato.
Done.
What the hell's the matter with you?! This is my favourite jersey.
Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?
G'night.
Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey.
Yes! I win again! Ha-ha! That's like 500 bucks you owe me! Whoo-ho-hoo! $500 that is a loooot of electricity! Whoo-ho-ho! I gotta buy some food.
Me too, we should get goin'.
I don't know how to lead.
Then you hold on to it!!
What message?
Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?
Here you go!
Phoebe here with the cab yet?
Ohh, then no. Maybe I should hear those specials again.
Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.
Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate this Pheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle.
Because of... the reason.
Yeah, I know!!!!
Ahh, you drive safe.
Well, it doesn't matter what I would do.
Everybody smile! Okay, thanks a lot! Enjoy your stay at Caesar's! We hope it's toga-rrific! Kill me. Kill me now.
Pheebs?
Hey guys!
Damnit Carl!
We'll just see.
Oh, I'd love too, but I got acting class. But y'know what? I guess I can blow that off, for you.
Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.
No! No! No! For my new fridge-our new fridge!
Oh, yeah.
The Celtics? Ha. They couldn't hit a boat if...wait. They suck, alright?
Who?
How could you lose him?
That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, "whoa."
Really?! Uhh, what color is it?
Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?
What do you need?
Hey-ooh Pheebs, are they in there?
What if I smack my head on the concrete?
Yeah! Much! Listen uh, not that I'm y'know insecure about my manhood or anything y'know, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right now.
I don't want to talk about it. Y'know, you could've at least saved me a whole cookie.
No, I'm good.
Nooo. No, no, ah, are you sure it wasn't something that sounded like Ginger, like ah, Gingeer?
How come the writing is in Spanish?
I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to?
I know!
Great. You got anything that's not Ralph Lauren?
Come on look guys, don't fight.
Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it. I was just going to get dressed.
Why God?! Why are you doing this to us?!
What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula.
But what about how much taller he is than me?
Alright open your eyes.
Yeah!
Yeah, I saw her this morning walkin' it by the park.
Problem solved.
Now? You want me to go over there now?
Hey Monica!
It is me! It's a musical version of Tale of Two Cities. So I think I'm gonna sing New York, New York, and ah, oh I left My Heart in San Francisco.
Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?!
Yeah.
You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.
What?
Sort of...
Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month.
: Ahhh, that's alright. Y'know, that's a tough hand to beat.
Ooh-ho-ho!
Just being friendly.
Yeah, they do! Quit being a baby and leave me alone! There, you've just had your first class!
Hey! You're here! Great! Great! Great! Let's get going buddy, we've got a scene to shoot!
All right that's it, school is in session!
Listen, I ah, I know it's a longshot. But, by any chance did she find that funny?
No, never done that either.
Hey!!
He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food.
Hey.
Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, she's real, uh, mellow!
All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today.
Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell. Now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?
Yeah?
Oh, "you do, do you"?
Oh I like this place. And technically, technically I'm not breaking any rules so I...
All right, I guess this will be fine.
I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back.
How'd you get to that?
Oh dear God, let me think.
Not good, no. I didn't get the part, and I lost my job here, so ...
Mornin'. I said, mornin'.
Damnit!
Yeah.
What?
Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks.
Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?
I don't know. You uh, you got something for me?
Had the beef-tips, huh?
Hello? Oh hey! Can you, can you hang on a second? It's the producers over at Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. can you excuse me for a minute? Hey, funny you should call. I was just looking over next week's script. Canceled?! Like they're taking it off the air? Ohh. All right, see you Monday. We're not even shootin' them anymore?!! All right, bye! They canceled Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E!
Hey! Hiya!
Oh, wait-wait! Maybe it's a pickle?!
What?
Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There's a lot of theories that didn't pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.
Hey, Pheebs!
Days Of Our Lives. Anyway, you're not gonna believe it! My character is coming out of his coma!!
Hey!
Hi!
You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!
What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's furniture has got Rachel coodies?
What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie.
Oh, great! Can you believe I found it on the second floor?
Don't come out here!
Two days ago.
Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!
'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
Nice!
What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?
Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn't have the car! Right?
Oh hey listen I got us tickets to a Knicks game tonight.
YES!!
Monica, pigeons learn faster that you.
Thank you. Hey Pheebs!
Ohhhh, good one! And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country.
So that's it? It's over? Just like that?
All right.
Now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya.
I think Saturday-.
Six.
Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine. Yeah. Yeah! It's not that I'm a bad actor...
Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.
Hey guys. Listen uh, you wanna get some dinner with me and Kathy tonight?
Yeah, my uncle Sal has a really big tongue.
Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!
Oooooh!
You hug me!
Well then tell me things like, 'Joey you'll be fine,' and, 'Hang in there,' and, and, 'Somethin' big's fonna come along, I know it.'
Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!
Okay.
Why?
Well, back to square one.
No. No. No.
Uh, listen I gotta double check for tickets tonight. Who-who got what?
Hey!
I don't think so.
Yeah, but uh, I don't want to be up too late, so uh, I'll have a decaf.
What do you got there?
Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now, you're gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the landlord.
Hey Phoeb's, I think you're good to go.
So, so how did it happen?
Pantyhose! Y'know? They way they start at your toe and go all the way up to here... I should go take these off shouldn't I?
It's all London, baby! Here we go.
Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.
Hey!
So, I hear you're single now...
You got all that from saline solution?
What, what is it?
Oh, we're supposed to just get him a ticket?! That guy is always mooching off of us!
How?! When?!
All right well, I'm outta here. Wish me luck.
Okay, done.
Hey.
We dare.
Well what is it?!
Check it out. How much of a man am I?!
I know! Neither did I!
Yeah, we'll be fine.
This is great, this is great, what else, what else?
Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea.
Hey Rach, do you smell smoke?
You wanna eat? My treat!
But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!
Marcel?
Hey Pheebs! Hey!
Well! What happened?! Did we miss it?
Which, is the new plan!
We did it!!
Saw a girl with that vest.
Ok, now that your coat is safely in the bedr-, oh, ok we can come back out in the living room.
Yes! I will have the lobster ravioli.
Dude, this isn't funny! What am I gonna do?! I go to bed last night, everything's cool! I wake up this morning, the stripper's gone and the ring is gone!
I can't believe what I'm hearing here.
They loved me!
Okay. Did ah, you guys mean you plus one?
Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!
She really said that?
Oh, can you believe they gave Stephanie skin cancer?
Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle. Y'know like you guys were doing last night. So, that's it. I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out.
Damnit!
Oh, that's OK. You uh, you had a thing.
From now on, it's gonna be Joey and Ross, best friends. Okay! We're gonna be the new Joey and Chandler.
Uh, they're like my best friends. Are you saying we can't hang out with them? 'Cause that would kinda be a problem.
Nope.
Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too.
I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.
You all right Chandler? Is there something funny about that name?
Who?
I'm coming up!
Well you gotta kiss someone, you can't kiss your sister.
Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played.
Damnit Carl!
Well, I couldn't do it. I told her I didn't want to get the part that way.
Whoa, I'm not done.
Bye-bye.
Look, it's too late, and I got an audition. I can't shop anymore! I...
What up?!
This is Janice.
Oh! That's nice.
Won't-won't that take longer?
What?
An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I'm getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me...
So, so, what'd ya think?
Hello.
Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger?
I didn't finish my five pages.
Not from where I was standin.
Well, I'm sorry. I thought parents were coming! Y'know? Your parents are comin'! Chandler's parents are comin'! Ross's parents are comin'!
Did you see the size of the closets?!
No! If anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica! Yeah. Yeah. She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London!
Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do?
In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.
Phoebe?
I just have to call my agent and tell her I can't do the part.
Althea!
Will you hurry up? Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janine's friends are dancers?! And that they're going to be drinking alot!?
All right, let's get me back up there!
But you got to be with both of them, right?
All right, I'll see you guys.
Nothing, why?
Hey, I don't need violence to enjoy a movie. Just so long as there's a little nudity.
Just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth?
Face to face, yeah!
Yeah, lady, I do! I got a problem with that!
Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?
It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A. That'd be cool.... This blows!
Pheebs! Pheebs! Ross wants to kiss you at midnight!
You should both know, that he's a dead man. Oh, Chandler?
Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still get cake right?
Come on! When you go away, you-you have to play, it's like a law!
If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you've got nothing pushing you to get another one. You need the fear.
Sure I can, standard shotgun rules, I'm sight of the room and I called it.
That's because all people are selfish.
Rachel, there you are! Come on, let's serve that dessert already!
I like that! Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em!
No! I want an award I did win! But nobody's giving me any of those! Plus-Hey Rach, if-if I put it up there right? When people come over they'll see it and they'll think I won it.
We don't make enough fun of you already?
But Phoebe, wait! Wait! Phoebe. Phoebe!
Can you believe this place?
Okay, pick a card.
Oh God. Uh, okay, here's the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is...
Oh, hey, don't forget your shirt.
What about me?! You-you just said I could!
Well, suppose until the baby's born I laid off it. No extra animals would die, you-you'd just be eating my animals.
I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldn't believe me.
Oh my God! How many of these things did you have? These are pure vodka.
You want to see her again, right?
Hey, how did you do that?! Come on in.
Oh! Hey, somebody left their keys. Ooohh, to a Porsche! Hey Gunther, these yours?
Well down at the adult video place down on Bleaker.
Oh, and plus I'm 1/16th Portuguese.
Oh, that poor bastard.
So?
Oh, it is.
Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big. Which I'm not.
WHAT?!!
Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right?
It's gonna be worth it. It's a known fact that women love babies, all righ? Women love guys who love babies. It's that whole sensitive thing. Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there. Maybe one of them will break away. No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left. All right, gimme the baby.
Well, we could do that!
Re! Re! Then I can watch that! Rewind it! Rewind it!
Huh?
So! You and Phoebe huh? How long have you been going out?
Oh, well no problem there.
Thanks man.
Okay.
Wow! Well, uh... Hey! I'm really happy for you guys! Congratulations! See you later.
If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah.
All right.
Hey-hey dude, why are you changing the subject? Why? Will you make the call or what?
Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh...
I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?
Sorry.
Noo-no-no, no, those are nicknames. I'm the chick and Chandler is the duck.
Greens? I'm a Tribbiani! And Tribbianis quit!
Sure!
All right.
Excellent.
What is the big deal?
Oh hey, here Pheebs.
Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour.
Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn't the hair straightener that started the fire. No-no, it was the candles. It's very not good leaving candles unattended. In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is... Uhh... Uhh... Okay. Well, I have to go now.
Hey, hey, check it out, guess what I got.
Hey.
Oh hey uh, be careful with that 3-D last supper, Judas is a little loose.
Uh, well they might be a little mad at me over there.
She's still asleep.
What are you doing?
Really? Who-who have you taught?
Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out.
I'm sorry, it just-I don't know it doesn't really look like it can do anything.
I'm telling ya, you guys are totally getting back together!
Hey, so where are my parents gonna be?
Yeah okay. Even though my tax dollars paid for this car.
Okay, pick a card, any card. All right, now memorize it. Show to everybody. Got it?
Tell us!
All right, put your 20 bucks down. First one to find the tasty treat wins. Okay?
Yeah, that was real.
See, I actually can pour milk, but I got you believing that I couldn't. Now, see, that's acting.
Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big? This is your baby. Hi Daddy!
Look, we're not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own hands!
Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges.
OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second floor of the New York CIty public library.
Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?
I won! That was my guess!
Thanks, Chandler.
What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you?
Hey, what have you guys been up too?
All right look, Ross, he's right. Emily's great, she's great! But this way too soon, you're only gonna scare her!
And you never knew she was a lesbian...
Hey-hey, hold on, this isn't some kind of like girly dance. All right, it's like a sport, it's manly!
Why don't you like PBS, Pheebs?
Hey!
Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk.
Everyday use.
Yeah, we haven't dropped it in...
All righty, what do you say we head back to my place?
Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I...
So Monica, still going out with Dr. Boring huh?
Look, we were way out of line, we totally support you.
Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio. Hey Monica listen is-is Phoebe there? I gotta ask her something about the car.
Now that you're a couple, we don't get two presents from you guys?
It'll kill him. I mean it'll, it'll just kill him.
I guess.
Yeah-eh-eah! Oh-oh, sorry, I-I knew what he meant.
Can I use your phone? Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.
Uh-huh, not as high as... It worked! King!
Hey.
No problem. Hey Chandler
And we don't work hard?
Phoebe, what-what are you doing?!
Man, I'm starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! "Do you want soup or salad?" Both! Always order both!
Hey!
Finally!
Well, maybe that's because you're closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.
What?!?!
Yeah. I'll uh, I'll call ya.
Really? I don't...
It's not.
Good. Hey.
All right, and over there is Brady's Pub where I like to unwind after a long day of surgeoning.
Yeah.
Who's Rick?
That's right baby.
Who's Elaine?
Uh, we might be leaving now.
Rach, there is a decent place to...
Gotcha. Phoebs, walk with me.
You got married to fast.
Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend zone.
Just kiddin,' I'll talk to them, you distract Rach.
Damnit, I'm a doctor, I'm not God.
Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.
And that's every month?
Who's Paul?
....Are we still talking about sex?
Look at this, how did I spend so much money?
Oh no this is devastating! My faith is shaken. I'm so glad I have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life.
What are you guys doing up?
Well, this has been great!
At least I care about his feelings!
What? What?
Your other student, was you!
Excellent, I'll be there.
Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking.
Question. Was ah, 'Egg the Gellers!' the war cry of your neighbourhood?
The balloon?
No, I don't think so.
What?! What's wrong with my eyes.
No, I'm not questioning it, I'm saying it's stupid! What?!
So, what did you guys think?
I like it!
Monica. Oh... huh, I always thought it would be Rachel.
Wow, what a cool job. 'You have two new messages.' 'Please, pass the pie.'
Y'know, we don't have to imagine.
I can hear you!
But I was Dr. Drake Remoray. How can I go from bein' a neurosurgeon to drivin' a cab?
Oh right great! Welcome aboard!
You gave him cookies?
Wow? Wow what?! Wow what?! Who you-what?!!
Yeah? What did ya have?
We can't do that.
You got it! And the rabbi's beard, 100% horsehair. Nice catch C.H.E.E.S.E.! It's your line C.H.E.E.S.E.! Wayne! Wayne!!
Ah whatever!
What's my little chef got for me tonight?
Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports-team!
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani!
You could say that.
All right, you got it.
Yeah...
You spit on me man!
No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.
Uh-uh nothing. I-I-I-I didn't want you to touch me cause I'm -I'm all sweaty from the workout. I better hit the shower. Oh my God!
Morning!
Oh my God!
No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.
Sorry. Wrong boobies.
And what did he say?
I'm gonna be on two TV shows!
Still not hot enough!
Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates.
Good night.
Well, I don't know!!
I'm out.
Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?
Let it go, Ross.
You meant sex, right?
Big day.
Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over, gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!
Ah, just one thing umm, is it all right with you if I, if I scream right up until you say action?
It's London, baby! All right, the hotel's here. Wait. No, we wanna go... No. I know. I'm gonna have to go into the map.
Let me see that!
I told ya.
Oh don't listen to him, he's just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don't think he's gonna get it.
Come on, Chandler, Ross is our friend. He needs us right now, so why don't you be a grown up and come and watch some TV in the fort!
Okay.
Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?
Yeah.
I'm, I'm okay. See.
Oh well listen, anyway she's directing the new Al Pacino movie. You gotta get me an audition!
So Pheebs, where are you doing all, your bell ringing?
Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?
Why isn't that valet back with my Porsche?
Why would you need to say hi to them, you've been feeding them for four days?
Oh yeah.
Yeah, so.
Yeah!
I think I'm gonna cry!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Like-like when I'm doing something exciting and I don't wanna get too excited, I just ahh, y'know try to thing of other things like ah sandwiches, and ah baseball, and ah Chandler!
We can't, alright? We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out.
Monica? What time is it?
So what's really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer.
Well uh, look Ross I uh, I think Carol's great and I'm sure you're a very attractive man, but I....
Girls say it to me all the time! And believe me, if she's anything like me, she's just gonna be relieved.
Yeah, not it here it isn't.
Hey!
Okay, is there anything else?
You know it's funny you should mention that 'cause I was thinkin'... what's with the boxes?
Oh, it's a new TV show. Yeah. I'm up for the part of Mac Macaveli or "Mac." Yeah, I'm a detective and I solve crimes with the help of my robot partner. He's a, he's a Computerized Humanoid Electronically Enhanced Secret Enforcer or-or "C.H.E.E.S.E."
I called the sperm bank today, they haven't sold a single unit of Tribianni. Nobody wants my product. I mean, I-I-I don't get it Maybe if they met me in person.
Yeah!! I call that London style.
Okay.
That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career we're talking about here!
Great! Problem solved!
She laughed at you?
I think face to face.
Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food! What's the matter?
Ahhh.
Hey! So, did you watch the tape of my show?
I don't need to think about it. I was Dr. Drake Remoray. That was huge. Big things are gonna happen, you'll see. Ross, you still there?
Thank you.
Sure. Coffee? 'Cause I'm going up there.
Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever.
But Jo's got a crush on Laurie. Oh. You mean it's like a girl-girl thing? 'Cause that is the one thing missing from The Shining.
And I ate the food, I had the fish, it was good, yeah. It was good, yeah...
What? Were you like in the movie, or... Anyway, she takes off her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve. Very sexy, and classy.
This is like the temporary robot, right?
I don't know! I haven't totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.
Um, this?
We should really learn how to play the real way.
So I uh, I just talked to the director. That's it, we're done for the day.
I'm fine with it, I mean, if you're OK watching a video filled with two nippled people.
Welcome to America.
Yeah, what are ya gonna do?
Who's seven?
Right over there! Right there! Look-look-look!
It's the big night! We wanted to wish you good luck!
Come on man! Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up?
Are you going to do it?
In the box.
Ooh!
Ah.
No, but he's...
Uh-huh.
What?
Yaaaay!
Okay, and ah, this one here is a Douglas Fir, now it's a little more money, but you get a nicer smell.
Awful! Horrible!
What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?
Tequila!!
How's that different? Oh! Yeah!
Yeah. Hey, I hope Ross didn't think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!
Uh, I scratched it on the ATM machine down on the corner.
Are you really not going?
Yeah-yeah, I'm one of the cops that won't work with you 'cause you a lose cannon. Anyway, look, I'm really sorry, but I stink!
No! Drums!
Great!
I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...
Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?
All right, congratulations you lucky bastard!
That's way uptown! That's like three trains away! Which is great! I love to ride that rail!
Yeah, we set up a court in your room. Uh, you didn't really like that grey lamp, did you?
Hey, stripper!
I put it on to scare Chandler!
I mean naked game. Strip poker, we should totally play strip poker.
So that's why I feed my dog Purina One! Pick up a bag today!
What?!
It's the chick! She's...going through some changes.
Yeah, well, I couldn't find any cards, so it was either this or Strip Bag Of Old Knitting Stuff.
Listen, you know how uh, when you're wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?
Woo-hoo!!
Dude, I'm telling ya! I'm fine!
Yeah.
I know!
Not following you.
What?!
Uh, does it hurt?
No! No! I can't! You gotta get me out of it! I've got plans! Important plans!
Oh no! No!! My hole!!
Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I've never been able to cry as an actor, so if I'm in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let's say I wanna convey that I've just done something evil. That would be the basic 'I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it' Okay, let's say I've just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13. And that's how it's done. Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.
But only in the moment. So do ya wanna kiss again?
OK, uh.... listen, there's something I want to talk to you about. The network casting lady...
What?
But it hurt's my Joey's Apple.
Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didn't know there.
Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?
What?! I didn't touch a guitar!
You know more than one Fun Bobby?
Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green.
Is it her fault that some of them didn't make it to you?
Isn't there any way you can keep him?
I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you.
I was thinking Chinese food.
Yes.
Yeah, I know, I sleep in the next room.
Yep! There's always room for Jell-O...
Yeah?
I don't know! Charity?
Yeah lady! Give us candy!!
Hey uh, what's a matter?
...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt.
Yeah! Once.
This sucks, I was just up by that much!
No-no-no, I'm serious. You don't smell it? Something's on fire.
Hey I was crying because, because nobody believed Quincy's theory. Okay?
I'm sorry Dutch, I didn't get that last little bit.
Yes!! Ha-ha!! All right! Hey! How cool would it be if you could watch like a real life-sized version of this? Huh? I mean how crazy would that be?
Your chair?!
Hey, Ross, Bodington's!
Great. Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the spoons.
I know! All right, I'll see you guys over there! I'm off to fight the Nazis.
Ooh!
Okay. Sorry about that... Uh, so where's C.H.E.E.S.E.?
Rach! Rachel! Okay, the next highest bidder is at table one.
So I guess it's Joey then!
Alright, well, I'm gonna order a pizza.
Can we see her?
You got me. I don't...
Hi!
Hey!
You shut up! I love arguing with her. I'll be right back.
From the land down under? I didn't know that either!
Come on! You like this woman, right?
Yeah, come on, think about it. You're 18, okay, she's 44, when you're 36, she's gonna be 88.
Hey, Phoebe, I asked you, and you said it was okay.
They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer?
Oh my God!!
Women are mean!!!
Get out.
Hey, Pheebs! It's Joey!
Come on man, really how old?!
Ok, um, uh, we three feel like, that uh, sometimes you guys don't get that uh, we don't have as much money as you.
They gave me the shaft all right.
Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she's like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!
With Carol? Oh.
Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Chandler, listen.
Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women.
Hey.
Hey!
That's right, it's all ruined! You guys ruined everything! You ruined it!
Yeah! And hey, thanks for coming with me. And thanks again for helping me take a shower.
Come here, check this out!
I got it.
No! All right, who-who makes up the questions?
Come on, quite yankin' me.
Hey, Monica bought a bed from the Mattress King?
Hey.
Hey, yo.
Estelle said I didn't get it.
Done.
Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.
This is clearly in the wrong apartment.
I just got off the phone with my sister.
I don't like this anymore.
Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?
So uh, what's your name?
All right. But, you're gonna have to tell them.
Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?
Okay.
Now, don't argue with me...
Here. Now I only owe you $49.50.
No, don't be sorry. I don't need it anymore. I found my identical hand twin!
Judge rules, no violation.
Let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat.
Look Rach, wasn't this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff?
Okay, get ready to owe me!
Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!
Oh, hey Katie! Everyone, this is Katie.
No we weren't!
Set....hike!
No. Nope, I uh...I th-I thought it might be kind of a cool character thing. Y'know? He's uh, he's a face toucher.
Uh, some of her friends, yeah.
Wow! Huh? Mac Macaveli, Private Investigator!
Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!
Sure! What's up?
A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks.
Hey.
Alright look, that's it. I don't think we should see each other anymore, alright. Look, I know I should have told you this a long time ago but I am not Drake Remore, OK. I'm not even a doctor, I'm an actor. I just pretend to be a doctor.
Hey uh, have you guys scene Chandler?
I know, but don't you think the sick thing is way better than the play thing?
Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me.
Yeah! You did! And that's why I'm leaving.
What's he doin' in my section?
Shut up!
No one.
Good, and hey! My treat. But that's only because you're not eating anything, right?
That's OK, Ross, you can ask me. What?
You're one to talk.
Hey, want a beer? WHOA!!!!
Hey, Pheebs?
Uh, Entertainment Tonight. Yeah, okay so, good talking to ya and don't come out here. All right.
All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk. And-and when she comes in hopefully, she won't recognise you because, well, why would she? Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I. You be Mr. Gonzalez, and I'll be uh, Mr. Wong.
Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man! All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time. And whatever you say, I'll believe ya. Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?!
No no no, behind it.
Yeah, life's pretty great isn't it?
I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the place. Y'know, everywhere I look she's like...
Hey!
Hey, you can't say you're breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy.
Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?
Anyone mind if I save this?
Well uh, I had breakfast here so technically I saved $3.50.
Oh, hey! Joey Tribbiani.
Okay. Well, if that's how you feel about it, fine! None of you get to live with me in my great big hand-shaped mansion! Except uh, you Pheebs. You can live in the thumb.
Yeah you see umm, well, I'm an actor. Right? So I gotta keep my emotions right at the surface y'know? See what I'm saying? I gotta lot of balls in the air. Y'know what I mean? It's tough! Guys like me, y'know, you wander around, you're alone...
Oh, uh, ok. Right this way. All the other pregnant women seem to be goin' in here.
Good, otherwise my watch would fall off.
Hey, I didn't stalk her. I mean
What are you guys woofing about?
Wow! Well, my folks really liked it! So what-what did you guys think? It wasn't that good.
Umm, do you see any-oh, Vaseline?
I am... free!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! She obviously didn't understand the question.
Oh no! No-no, keep reading! The good part's coming up. Keep going.
Wow!
Hi.
Look Mon, if you could just call my mom...
Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad....
Thank you.
It looks like a women's purse.
Ten. Okay. Now Tag there's such a thing as to many women.
I can't write! Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know? I can't do it.
You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.
But, I love you.
That's not gonna work out! Then she's gonna come home all weepy and you'll be tellin' her, "Oh that's okay. You'll find someone." And then, bamn! She finds you!
Dr. Drake Remoray. Days of Our Lives. Voted most datable neurosurgeon by Teen Beat.
Oh yeah.
Well, maybe he's, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy.
I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex.
Look, there's nothing I can do for him right now, he's still in his sweat pants, that's still Phase One. Y'know? I'll be back for Phase Two, I would never miss Phase Two.
Well, how-how come?
Hey. Man, it is so hard to shop for girls.
Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together.
Hello.
Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it.
The Red Ross! Okay.
Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes. I'm tellin' ya!
Hey.
Well, you're amazing.
No, the quiet down thing!
Oh man!
Chandler gave me word of the day toilet paper. I'm gonna get some coffee.
Well then maybe I will.
It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock! Huh?
Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?!
It's just I can't because my manager said I... "Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear Annie...
All right. Okay. Well this is the same kind of deal. If you're going to do something wrong, do it right!
Aaaaagggghhhhh. Mommy
Hey listen, so when's-when's my audition? I mean I know it's Thursday, but what time?
What?
Hi!
Okay, you're on.
Ah yeah-wait a second now! Look we're gonna have to set a spending limit on the date. I don't have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.
Uh-oh, shht! The Misses.
I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars.
No, one man for the rest of my life? I don't know if I can do it! This means I'll never get to sleep with Joey!
Well all right then, I guess I shouldn't get to excited about the fact that I just kissed her!
So let me get this straight. If you go with Bonnie tonight, you're doing the smart, healthy thing and moving on.
Yeah but it's too much stuff. You know like, you got the candles and the foofy schmoofer thing here and over here you got a picture of a watering can.
Yeah! But if would've know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn't have worried about it so much! See you around!
Yeah.
I went back to Riffs. I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered was coffee, she brought me a tuna meltt and four plates of curly fries.
No-no, things ah, finally happened with Kate.
Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!
Umm, well, what else could it be?
Well, well that one has ducks on his t-shirt, and this one has clowns. And Ben was definitely wearing ducks.
What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?
You got it.
You got it!
Cookie, now you can punch him!
You guys need anything, 'cause I'm heading up there.
Then you're not invited.
'Kay!
Sure! But hey, you know this way sounds good too.
Oh, no no, that's the beauty part, it goes with everything. You put this on, you're good to go. Ohhh man, you are so wearin' that bracelet.
I don't think so.
All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game.
Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not.
Here comes the beep, you know what to do.
And I ah, borrowed some of your cologne. I hope she likes it.
No! Not unless! Look this must end now!
What about Ross? I mean, are you still mad at him cause he made that list about you?
PBS telethon.
Uh, Pheebs we kinda need you to drive us all up there in your grandmother's cab, but y'know what, I'll stay.
Aaaaagggghhhhh.
Yeah.
I hate Pottery Barn too. They kicked me out of there just because I sat on a bed!
What?
Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
What?
Nice!
I'll take it back tomorrow.
Sweepin'. Why? Turn you on?
Their not breaking up. Chandler and Janice. Their not breaking up. He didn't blink or anything.
You think I need a new walk?
Okay, great!
Listen, drama critics they're nothing but, but people who couldn't make it as actors. You know what you should do?
Heh, what d'ya say?
Oh-ho-kay, I'm talking to the king.
Yeah! I stayed at Kate's, but ah, nothing happened. Hey, Pheebs, where were ya?
I call it!!
Are you bachelors?
Uhh, just a minute officer!!
Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her.
Phoebs, he's just a little dog. Ahhh.
How can you say that?! The Mets have no closer!
You have any idea what this'll do for your sex life?
Well, it's not a part, no. I'm teaching acting for soap operas down at the Learning Extension.
Hey!
I can hear that!
I did not know that! Thank you Monica. I can't believe I almost lost another girl because of counting.
Okay, retract the device, retract the device.
Oh, I got it! How about saying something like, "Monica...
Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually.
Yeah?!
What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant.
I don't feel like talkin.
Yeah, it is! You wouldn't have lost the ring, right? Y'know what, Ross you were right from the start, he should be your best man.
I mean, there's no way I can make myself taller now, y'know? And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?
What are you doing?
Oh yeah!
Yeah!
Sounds nice.
Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!
Mornin' Pheebs!
I know! It's stuck!!!
Get out!!
Can we come it yet?! We're dying out here!
Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.
Oh, man, I could totally get that part. 'I'm sorry, that seat is taken.'
Wow, look at that. The car is on fire, yet somehow it's expensive paint job is protected by the Miracle Wax.
Heard about the leg burnin' huh?
Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?
You don't drink.
Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment.
Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know...
Hey!
Yeah-yeah, absolutely.
Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!
That is incredible! You are the master!
Someone like an...angel?
No-no-no I've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret?
Whoa-whoa, what's the matter?! Talk to the captain!
Rach, these are for you.
Yeah!
I know.
Not the other one?
All right, you're probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it was me, and this is just me, I would ah, I would bow out.
When? Today? Some, not a lot.
Yeah.
Sir.
Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady.
I didn't do that! Who would've done that?!
Her name is Dutch, and also Marklan.
All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, you should go for it!
Oh no-no-no-no!
Hey Gunther.
Pisst, Monica. Alright, we really need to start looking out for Rachel. I'll cover the front door. You watch that big hole at the back of the building and I got Chandler covering Ross.
Aww crap!
All-all right! Start it up! Let's go!
Well, I want it!
He doesn't do much, does he?
Yeah.
What? I don't get it.
I can't believe you're not picking me.
Oh, well I'm uh...
Oh.
Look, what am I gonna do? I'm not flirting but still, I'm drawing her to me like - like a moth to a flame! What the hell's going on over here?!?!? Monica's gonna kill you! Look I need your help, I have to do something to-to repel this woman! Wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all the time.
All right.
It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands.
Yeah?
Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?
What is the matter with you?!
Ohhh. Ahh! What are you doing?! I thought you were gonna take her back to the store today.
Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy direct Burger King commercials?
Yeah good luck, good luck.
Actually, y'know it's kinda cold, so how about I keep my boxers on, and give you all a peek at the good stuff?
Don't you see what this means?! I can forget about that stupid movie. I'm gonna be a millionaire!
I'm comin' out!
So, you saw me on Days Of Our Lives huh? Want me to, want me to do a little Dr. Drake Remoray for ya?
I'll be right back. What was that?
Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.
Hey.
Yes! Yes, I did.
Hey.
The Irish gig guy?!
Ooh-ooh, I! I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having.
Yeah, but what if he doesn't? He's such a good duck.
How is "Monica, I love your sweet ass," inappropriate?
Thank you so much.
Yeah I guess you're right.
I have to pee. And Rachel's in the bathroom!
Yeah?
Well, it involved Monica.
Uhh, I'm guessing the threshold's clear now.
No, no, no, don't get up, I got a cooler right here.
'Cause it's a television show.
Okay. I went down to the 'Mattress King' showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband.
Dawson?!
You guys! You guys! You're not gonna believe what my agent just told me!
All right, I'll take care of it.
Not a dad.
Yeah-Hey, don't worry, she's a terrific girl. And hey listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I'm not looking for a serious relationship; that'd be great.
Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.
Look, we are not gonna...
Later! Oh man! Hot girl! Hot girl!!
So I'm thinking, basically we pick it up and then we flip it.
That'll be $3.85.
Yeah.
But that's what...
How many times do I have to tell you! Ya, turn and sliiiide! Y'know, turn and slide.
Well, that went well. Yeah.
I know.
What?!! That's even worse!!
Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!
No.
How do you do there, Wayne?
It's Joey.
People, people, people.
Whoa-whoa-hey-hey! Hi, Paul is it?
Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me, here.
Like you wouldn't believe. Wow! This is a great place.
Well, y'know those special skills I have listed on my resume? I would love it would be great if one of those was true.
That's not a bad idea. Yeah. Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow I'm not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys. Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs.
I don't know. But hey, I know we can decide. Okay, I'm gonna ask you questions and you answer real quick. Okay?
What are you mad at me for?!
All right, I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You see Rach I'm an actor...
Yeah, I'm an actor.
You got it! Oh-oh!
Dah!!
Yeah? Really? No one's home?
No.
Okay, I guess it doesn't seem that weird.
We've got a box.
No, that's VH-1. I gotta tell you, the music these kids listen to today . . . It's like a lotta noise to me. I don't know...
Okay.
Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars.
Who knows?
Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?
Good luck Phoebs.
Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me.
Oh, thanks, thanks. Bye bye Jeannie.
Uhh do you happen to have a hot girl in there?
See ya tomorrow!
I'm still on the set!
Where's my underwear?!
I'm sorry, I just...I like things the way they are.
How could you do this to me Chandler?! This part could've turned my whole career around!
No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.
Oh, that sounds like fun, but we've got a ring to find!!
Okay.
Oh, well great.
Well you-you-you-you might say congratulations! I saw the board! I went to the audition! I got the part!!
Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever had!!
Hey! You ready to go?
Aww, me too. Now let's finish this and go to bed.
Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two.
Dude you said, "No!"
Yeah.
And of course, crotchless panties.
Judge rules, Nutter-Butter.
I'm listening.
Okay, maybe he's not his best friend, but ...
Look it's not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door.
Oh what, wait, wait a second, I mean, what are we doing? Who's going with who?
What?
My mom will.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, that's why I let people watch.
Thank you! Well, I guess now I know who I'm taking to the awards.
She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it.
I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those...
Awwwww!! Awwwwwww!!!
It does in mine!
Where are you going?
What's the big deal, sit somewhere else.
Thank you.
What's wrong buddy?
What are you doing?
U-N-I-sexy?
Do you want me to want you to care?
Oh yeah, I always picture your Mom when I'm having sex.
Hey Jessica.
Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought you'd be out partying with Gandel-worf.
Mary-Angela.
It's no big deal. Hey, y'know, you do what you gotta do. Right?
Really? Oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it.
Are you sure?
Alright, I can make my peace with the clean dry towels...Also what is with these chips you bought?
Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.
Oh, and guess what, I got an audition for All My Children.
Hey!
Damnit Phoebe!!
Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.
Ah-ha!
Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?
Doesn't seem like it's going to work, I mean...
Look, I don't wanna hear this right now.
Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know....
It's got 'em!
No, that means nothin to me.
That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously? Okay.
Hey, there's a dog out there!
Get out! I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me.
Well, either you break it off with Ronni
Hey! How's it going?
Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember?
Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?
Right, they uh, they choppered me in. What's up?
Ten, ten.., nine, nine, nine...., eight, eight, eight... Okay, Blast off!
Why not?
I didn't know that! Well, what a pretty last name!
Where the hell have you been?!
Look at this clown! Just because he's got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. Get out of the way jackass! Who names his boat Coast Guard anyway?
And he never played before either! Y'know what I think? I think beginner's luck, very important in Cups.
Yeah, it's for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. It's a very important issue in this month's Playboy. I'm sure you all read about it.
Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't you guys?
My folks.
How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
No it isn't! No, it's not. Because you can also explain it with the truth!
You can't make crotchless panties? You take, you take a pair of scissors and you just cut...
North route!
How's that pig-in-the-blanket workin' out for you? I wrapped those bad boys.
Serious?
I call Godfather!
Or maybe, it's because you're hanging around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday.

You practice losing the Grammies too?
A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That's the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?
Ohh great!!!
Yeah. What are we getting?
Oh, OK.
Uh, four.
Check the freezer. If there's none in there, then we're probably out. Are you just getting in from work? It's late.
Have you seen Monica?
Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?
I know. It was so cool when I was up there before. Me and Jim Belushi would just be crackin' up about something... Then I get fired off of Days Of Our Lives and he takes me down. Now he's just laughing at me. Look at him, that smug Belushi bastard, I'll...
Yeah, sure.
Wow! I'm so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much.
That's a two line part.
What they're not invited?! Oh no, that's terrible! They're gonna be crushed!
Mark's a genius!
That's right!
Wow, it's big!
All right, I'm gonna go say hi the chick and the duck.
Yeah well, I'm guessing after this she's not going to be crazy about electricity either.
Seriously, good game though. Good game. What are they so mad about? They get the apartment back!
I have an audition, but I'll definitely hook up with you later. Where are you gonna be around noon?
Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing.
Well, I guess I could sleep with her... I mean, how could I do that?
Oh, what did I say?
Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and...
Uhh, hey. Where's the other guy?
Look, you guys have been to every play I've ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?
Hey.
No! No, I'm the minister! All right, look-look, put 'em both on the phone, I'll marry them right now.
And the winner is...Joey Tribbiani! Oh... Wow! I honestly never expected this. I uh, I didn't prepare a speech. But umm, I'd like to thank my parents, who've always been there for me. I'd also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel...
Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or- That's fine, yeah...
What's the rush? What?
Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!
Yeah. So uh Ross, well now-why did that first marriage breakup? Was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian?
Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!
Oh noo...
Im sayin I see a difference.
Check out the rack on this chick!
No, no, you can't, you can't, okay, you can't, you can't buy her pearls, you just can't, you can't, you can't.
I've gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy!
I'm sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.
What award are you practicing for?
Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello. He'll know what it means.
Oh no, can't invite her. She also steals.
And what's cool is, the character is from Naples, right?
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wanna know how I did it, I'll show ya. When you handed me back the card, what you didn't see was, I looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye. I just did it. I just did it, again. Here, I'll slow it down so that you guys can see it.
But hey, Ross, this place is available now!
Whoa. Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Oh my God.
Sure.
Oh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay, maybe I'll talk about London! Y'know when you two hooked up! Only, only I won't say hooked up. I'll say, "Began their beautiful journey..."
Exactly.
They can't kill me, I'm Francesca's long lost son.
Y'know, when we talked about face to face, I don't think we thought it all the way through.
So, I guess this is it.
Okay!
I can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'.
What's in it?
It certainly is a miracle.
Yeah!
Look at this! A millionaire's checkbook.
Two pizzas?!
Well we'll see!
I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!
Oh, yeah, totally! That's such a turn-on!
Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.
Oh wow! You can tell this soon.
I don't know.
Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joey's your pal. Joey's your buddy. "Where is everybody?" "Well, they're hanging out with Joey."
I know. chandler: Now we can finally watch Green Acres the way it was meant to be seen.
Hey, how much will you give me to eat this whole jar of olives?
Oh, we're having a big party tomorrow night. Later!
Ben! Ben! Ben!
How was your conference?
Is that your card?
Hey.
We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that I'll be there as soon as I can.
Whoa! Okay. Yeah well, who-who was in World War I?
If anything should happen to him...
That tone will not make me go any faster.
Eh, what are you gonna do?
Oh!
Y'miss it?
Now you're thinking you gotta sleep with him.
Yeah!
Hey Gunther, don't let that guy in here anymore! He just said Phoebe's a porn star!
Picture? What picture?
I'm him.
Hey. I just got off the phone with Estelle and guess what. I GOT THE LEAD IN A MOVIE!!!!!!
Chandler! I don't need luck. I have thought this through!
Well, you might wanna make a little extra, y'know you'll probably be hungry after the sex.
"...by doin' it."
That's Fergie baby!!
So you ah, ready for our last practice?
Thanks for stopping by. See ya! I-I am so sorry. I...
That sounds fair.
Yeah.
No!
Uh listen, here's your Soapie. I accepted it for ya.
Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is...
Ahh-oy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right Monica?
Hey!
All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay? You're hot. I'm lovable. Clearly there's a vibe going on between us. But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.
He-he-eyy.
A two and a five.
Hey!
Well hey, at least you got to see a lot of stuff, right?
We already knew that!
So I got your car, it's right outside.
Probably Monica and Chandler.
Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her! And her roommate!
It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.
We make fire. Cook meat.
Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.
Geez, look how fat she got.
Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.
She's gone.
Yeah, she's been in there all day , uh high fever, a nose problem... Phlegm! Phlegm! Phlegm-phlegm-phlegm!
C'mon, she's your mom!
Home sweet home, huh? Nice to, uh, get back to reality. Plus we know how the New Year's gonna go off. I guess there's no reason for all that Y2K panic, y'know? Anyway, g'night!
Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I like you. I-I really do, I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat.
How could I not get the part? The play was about a 29-year-old Italian actor from Queens.
No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. It's a one day job, max.
Where do you think, Zelda?
No you're not! Not to me!
See you in 2003.
Wait. Give him a minute.
Thanks Ross. I really like that bird though...I'll take the dog though.
No! I'm up for a Soapie!
Okay, look I'm sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldn't have, but you got porn!
We'll do it all, and better! Look, after tonight, Gandolf will want to party with us, dude! Come on!
Well, everyone will enjoy my music as well.
I didn't get it?
Monica-Monica-Monica-Monica, listen-listen, listen, listen, would-would it make you feel better if we all stop talking about Ross and Rachel.
Hey!
We have a winner!
I was tryin' to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I'm gonna do?
Yep, that's my audition.
You can't do anything!
Right! And when is that due?
Vulva?
Hey there you are!
Well?!
Seven hundred bucks!
Yeah! I'm fine! Thanks! Hey Rach, how you doin'?
Oh, and how is Allison?
Ahhh...... Eh?
Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there!
Goodnight.
Rachel, would you stop saying that?! Hey-hey look, remember on the show when-when Caprice was dying and she gave me...
Blah?!
Come on man, just-just let the girls stay, I'll do whatever you want.
Pheebs!!
You know what, you guys? It's their first time, why don't we just forget about the money, alright?
Yes! Yes!! And every time you look at it, I want you to remember that you are a good person. Okay, you've had the chance to cheat, and with me, but you didn't. And that's what this ring stands for.
Okay, what if the puppy said, "Help me Chandler. All the other puppies pick on me."
Hey, what's the horsepower on this thing?
It's not that far! Just drop!
Hey!! Hey-hey-hey!
Yeah!
So uh, how you doin'?
I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not.
You could drink the fat.
Well, I'm pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey, Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy.
Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?! I wanna sit in my chair!
And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.
I'm movin' out like we talked about.
I kinda feel like it's my fault.
Y'know what? I think that's enough for now. Yeah. I don't want to be over rehearsed.
Uhh, Ms. Phalange, may I ask you a question as an impartial person at-at this table?
Yeah I did!
Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!
'My scones.'
Hey Ross!
Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first.
But I counted, you're not supposed to live here! Oh man!
All right, give it back to me. 5 of hearts.
Saw the Porsche out there Mon, lookin' good. When do I get to take that baby out again?
Wow Pheebs, you speak Italian?
Okay.
Merry Christmas!!
The fruit roll up.
Hey, Felicity.
Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?
Whoa. That was really good.
Well all right so, it looks like we're even!
Well I didn't tell them!
Yeah. No-no I-I know I might not win, but it's just...I've never even been nominated before! I want it so much.
Come on, they're close.
Yes!
Hard to say.
Wouldn't she?
Ooh! So close.
Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does.
Freaky.
What if we have to pee?
Are you serious?!
Uh, I don't know. Ya see, it's just, see I was a regular on a soap opera y'know? And to go from that to this, I just... Plus, I'd have to wait on all my friends.
No-no! No! I mean it's gonna be all smelling like Monica!
No. No. No. She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left.
I will sit with you Dr. Geller.
Very good! Okay. G.
Yeah, he likes porn.
Yes!!! Ha-ha-ha!
Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!
Well then, do it better!
-Peaches?
Listen also we're uh, we're watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over.
What's the matter with Rog?
What a phony.
Chandler!
Did-did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear?
We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...
Wait, well, where did you get it from?!
What?!! That's even worse!!
Page 42, page 42, page 42.
The Empty Vase. Translucent beauty...
Or clowns. Oh, oh wait. That one's definitely Ben. Remember, he had that cute little mole by his mouth.
Hey you guys, check it out. Check it out. It's like it's coming right at me.
Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie!
I'm...happy...for you?
Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right? So, I'm in my map and-and... Hey!
No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
Mornin' Pheebs. Well, my movie has officially been canceled.
Well, you should've told me that before, I'm not a mind reader. Hey, we're out of beer. I'm going to Monica's.
Really?
But, he loves Emily?
Ohh, no, no. We're not going to just sit. Shhh.
All right, I'm here, let's ahh, get this over with.
Yeah I'll take that.
No you don't, I just saw you go in there with Monica!
Yeah but, I can pronounce Jurassic.
Yeah, that guy really hurt us.
Wow! Didn't know that.
Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.
Good enough to get fired.
And-and-and-and-and the toothpicks?
Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valente's.
What do ya say? What do ya say?
Oh, I will.
Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!
I am telling you Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again! Now, is that what you want?
Cool, thanks.
Ooh, we could end up with nothing.
Yeah! You...you were wonderful.
No, no, no, I'm telling ya. Imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand okay? So the question is, what do we do?
Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!
Hey!
Sure, it looks stupid now, there's no music playing.
Okay. Okay.
And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and, and, and bite her!
Damn! I am good at Cups!
Oh, absolutely! You're talented and you're good looking.
Yeah, that's her.
Are you calling you people? Yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal on Santa Clause right?
Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!
No-no-no, please-please Chandler I-I-I would owe you so much!
I look more like him than you do!
I know, Monica told me.
Sorry, that was wax.
I'm sorry! But hey, it's over now, right? Because you can tell them that you know they know and I can go back to knowing absolutely nothing!
Oh hey, do you still have their final exams?
Dude! How come you took off?
How'd it go?
Shhhh!
I can't hear a word you're saying, my ears are ringing so bad.
Well anyway, the guy they wanted backed out and now they want me! I start shooting today!
I know it doesn't make much sense...
Yeah, she said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day.
That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?
Yeah, I-I just made up the stuff about the wedding because I didn't want you to worry about me. But, I'm having surgery today.
Power saw kinda got away from me there.
What?
Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it!
Hey now!
The question should be Rach, what is not so great about the shining. Okay? And the answer would be nothing. All right? This is like the scariest book ever. I bet it's way better than that classic of yours.
Come on man there's gotta be something that gets you choked up! Like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?
Oh unless you uh, you wanna hang around.
Oh there is! If you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen!
Yeah. Yeah.
Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?
Because they wanted me to audition!
Oh yeah, sure, that makes sense. Yeah. 'Cause you already told her you love her and she didn't say it back, then she called you and told you that there's another guy, so yeah, go to London that'll scare her!
The airport?
Well, there's really only one thing you can do.
Lean-lean-lean!
Hi.
Thanks. Yeah, I figure if I wear these in my scenes at least I won't get spit in the eyes, y'know?
Yes! Yes! Unreasonable!
Great! Thanks.
Get down!
Hey Rach, you uh, you want some sandwich?
Yeah, he's the reason I didn't get that big Minute Maid commercial a couple of years ago remember? We were supposed to be brothers, but he messed it up.
Oh yeah?
No that's all right. Don't worry about it.
All right!
All right relax, look I'll pay you with the money from the acting job I am definitely gonna get thanks to you.
What you-you don't think I'm gonna win?
Wow thanks!
Hey, you don't even live here anymore! What are you doing answering my phone? I have my machine!
Okay.
Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how you'd handle maid of honor type situations.
God, it's gonna so weird like when I come home and you're not here. Y'know? No more Joey and Chan's. No more J and C's. "You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler's?" "Can't, its not there."
So then how could you I mean, how could you?!
Hello.
He's kinda tall, dark hair, hand looks exactly like this. See?
Wait up!
Ross!
Hey!
What?! What?!! What is it?!
Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross's behalf. I-I think the rule applies here y'know, since she has a chance to get on broad back...
Oh-ho-ho, yeah! Hey! Y'know what goes good with that?
Wow! That was good. That was... Tweezers?
Yeah well next thing you know, he'll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!
Dude, they're not objects.
What are we supposed to be seeing here?
It's a rented tux. Okay. I'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues.
Pheebs! There you are! Okay, you broke my fridge; you owe me 400 bucks!
Nice move.
That's not food...No, I don't, no... Everything's different here...I want to go home. I...I miss my family. I miss the coffee house. I can't even remember what Phoebe looks like.
Oh come on. Nobody likes two different kinds of eggs equally. You like one better than the other and I wanna know which.
Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening?
There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!
Then, uh, then I'm sorry.
How?! When?!
Hey! Now, I've been watching some tapes, how's this? "Jessica Lockhart will never step foot in this place again! Ever!!"
Yeah, whatever.
No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.
No, we're alright.
Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, it's Julie, for you.
Come on, Lydia, you can do it. Push! Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder, harder. Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out! Let's get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho. Let's I was justyeah, right. Push! Push!
See ya!! What the hell was that?!
Yeah right!
Oh, okay. The what?
What?!
Right-right up here.
Hey, look who's up.
Yeah!
Wow. That's almost as much as a new book.
Oh, dude I'm so sorry!
Joey Tribbiani.
Yeah, they're not coming.
Well usually...yeah! Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice. Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. I'm such a jerk.
Ugh, I cannot wait to ask her out!
no. No, I, I couldn't do that.
You pushed him!
Ewwwww!
We love you, man.
Ooh, sorry! No-no-no, so close though, but-bye-bye!
Okay listen, how are you gonna ask her?
Oh, y'know what? It's probably just your burnin' loins.
Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don't have time! They're just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.
Yeah, it's this great part, this boxer named Nick. And I'm so, so right for it, y'know, he's just like me. Except he's a boxer, and has an evil twin.
After she gave me that big speech?! She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me? I think she's trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!
Yeah! Well, now that you brought it up, our fridge is broken. We have to get a new one. Now, I checked around and your half is $400. Thanks a lot.
Well, where was I?
Uh, yeah but uh, I may have said those things before but, I never truly meant them. Until now.
There y'go, kids.
I couldn't even if I wanted too.
That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.
...look both ways before you cross the street.
Hey, no way, that rooster's family!
No, I wasn't gonna ask you that, no.
Yeah, or-or to get a hooker.
So that if we went out on a date, shed be there.
Oh God, yeah.
Then you go to Tokyo.
Hey!
Fine! Do you want something to drink?
Yeah, I... I don't want Stevie to see her like this.
All right, I'm gonna go say hi the chick and the duck.
Oh-oh-oh, yeah! That's right, you take good care of those babies!
Well no, I'm just in a coma. This must mean I have lines! Oh...
Pheebs! Sorry!
Hey.
Whoa-whoa-whoa! You're not gonna use the pay phone to call work, are ya?
Well, so anyway Beth, what I'm saying is I should've considered your feelings before I went home with you that night. I've ah, I've recently learned what's it like to be on your side of it, and I'm sorry. So, do you think you can forgive me? Great. Thanks. Okay, bye. Hello, Jennifer? Oh hi, Mrs. Loreo, is Jennifer there? Oh, she's not home huh? Well ah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.
Who?
Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.
Well sure, you name a kid that, what do you expect them to grow up to be?
No more jam?!
Yes.
Hey! Mine was by accident! All right, the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel, and kills the dad.
Wow! The new Playboy!
Yeah, I uh weighted like 27 pounds when I was born so...
Phoebs, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out.
Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more-
Ugh. Now if a cow should die of natural causes, I can have one of those right?
That's right Ross, I can see you in your new apartment! And you can see me! Same as yesterday, same as the day before.
Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment.
Hey.
Holden McGroin.
Hey!
Do we have to know about that?
Look.
Well if it's free food, how come you're charging me for it?
Hi!
Hi, uh, I'll be reading for the role of Mercutio.
How's that going?
How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might.
Yeah, she tops out at 130.
Ahhh, I fold like a cheap hooker who got hit in the stomach by a fat guy with sores on his face. Oh, I'm out.
Plastic spoons. Great.
What a bad idea!
Hey, here's a thought, Ross.
And-and-and not only that, I'm gettin' a new brain!!
Aw, man I'm sorry . This must be very tough for ya, huh .
Great! Thanks, Rach!
Oh well, hey, Joey's loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he'll be there.
You forget how many great songs Heart had.
Everything on your application looks really good-Ohh! Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?
Look, Rachel, we don't have to do this.
Yes sir! Yes sir, I'm-I'm-
Yeah, I was bummed too.
Oh, I am going to go for a walk in the rain.
Yeah, take a hike wetpants!
We're the guys.
Don't worry man, I get to bring a guest. We'll show him.
Incredible! I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was.
Joey.
No-no-no, I think I'm gonna see how things go with Kathy. She's pretty cool.
Look listen, that TV movie I went in for? Did you hear anything? I think I got a shot at it.
Chandler!
Why can't I find that?
Thanks.
This is Vegas man! People will pay to see freaky stuff! Okay, how much would you pay to see this hand twice? Huh?
When I was little, I wanted to be a veteranarian, but then I found out you had to put your hands into cows and stuff.
Uh-oh.
Heyyy.
Just pull on it.
That's how they do pants! Ross, will you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?
Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned.
Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else.
How can they do this to me?
Sorry.
Oh man! They-they just redid my make-up!
Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!
Ah, now Rach, these ah, these little women.
Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice.
Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it myself, y'know.
I Gotcha!!
Uhhhh.
She is so hot!
Oh Monica, listen, I ah, I saw down at the hardware store, they got those designer tiles on sale. If you ever want to redo the bathroom floor.
Not if you're gonna be like this!
Well, the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money, so I'm working here 'til it starts up again, if it ever does.
Come on!
Wow! Well then I'll just have to carry you.
All right, I'll see you in the morning.
What?
Ohh yeah, that's the stuff.
Oh.
Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.
Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!
Pheebs! Wait up! Listen uh, close your eyes. Maybe that's one thing you can cross off your list.
Okay, great.
You got that from what I said?!
Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks! Okay? She-she-she's hurting me.
Good for you!
Hey, y'know what? I'll come too. I'm making money now; it's about time I give something back.
Come on Rach! Look, turning thirty is not that big a deal.
Well, no not yet. But the audition went really good.
That's what it says.
Oh, nothing, no. It's an acting exercise, I'm practising my fake laugh.
Spock's birth control.
Hey.
I-I wasn't in that.
..ah, what're you doing here? I've been trying to call you.
Because, I know what I like and what I don't like! It's not the same thing!
Pastrami.
Woo-hoo! All right! Yeah!
Ok, ok, How about if we split it?
Y'know what?
Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.
I've got a science question.
I know, and only one layer of jam?! What is up with that?
London baby!!
Okay, here! I wanna be the on camera guy. All right, first stop, Westminster Abbey.
I don't know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall, smart blond guys, name like.... Hoyt.
You're smart. I like that.
You serious?
Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.
Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?
That's great. Thanks Rach.
The vicar!
Good, me too. Eggs and milk are in the fridge. Thanks.
Yeah! No?
Hey.
Yeah?
Name one!
All right! Now hey, I need to use the bathroom. Since I don't need any assistance in there, take a break!
Well, now we got a reason.
Forget about it.
Why not?
Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout.
Hey that's not true! Look at uh, look at Angela Lansb-Angelina Jolie!
Alright... I've got to go shower.
How you doin'? Joey Tribbiani, America.
My identical hand twin! The person whose hands are exactly like mine! This thing is a gold mine!
What-what is it, what is it?
Okay, uh Pheebs, quick. Look! This is for the babies to look at someday, so is-is there anything you want to say? Y'know before it all starts?
Ohh, hey! Why don't you book a date for both of you at one of those romantic spas?
Okay, I'm all right, okay, but hey, could you just leave your lips?
Rach we had to get out of there because, look what I won!
Hey no-no-no-no! It's cool! It's cool! I-I'll only be a second, I'm still with my bride's maid, I just-Where are those condoms you brought?
Now-now, listen this is just a first draft so... "We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to celebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share." Eh? "It is a love based on giving and receiving. As well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared and received. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving." "We too can share and love and have and receive."
Well, I get the medical award for separating the siamese twins. Then Amber and I go to Venezuela to meet our other half-brother, Ramone. And that's where I find the world's biggest emerald. It's really big but it's cursed.
Hey! So, what's with the 20 percent tip? Did I do something wrong?
Not me.
I said name one!
No. No, Kathy.
Seriously, you like it? This guy was sellin' them on 8th avenue and I looked at 'em and I though, you know what I don't have?
Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.
That's not funny at all!
Yeah. I understand. I understand. Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first!
Why?
Why is 10 the highest?
Hey, Kate!
I don't know! How about, "Thanks for taking the message." Jeez!
My god, Angela.
Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?
This sucks man! The last night you're here and I lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500.
Dahhhhh!! No! Noooo!!
No, as part of the audition. See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses.
So anyway, I'm trying to get my boss's ex-wife to sleep with me. . .
All right that's it! You're yelling and I don't see you taking your top off! I quit!
"Happy birthday to you!"
Ooooohh!
Hey babies! Oh, I'm having the best morning. That uh, that Porsche I've got the keys too, still there!
Yes you are!
Yeah, he did, look... look, it's right there on the counter! Ha-ho-ho!
What you do mean?
Hey Pheebs, guess who we saw today.
You guys have one of those signs that says 'We don't swim in your toilet, so don't pee in our pool.', you know.
Oh yeah! I got in there myself once. My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn't, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in. Yeah. It was funny 'til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.
Nicole Eggert. You'll like her.
She's my biggest fan. Yeah, she's the only one in the family that's believed in me.
That's great, but isn't it gonna bother that people still think you're a porn star?
No I just uh, thought you liked your eggs with the bread with the hole in the middle, a-la me.
Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!
Right, and you go with Rachel, Bonnie's free tonight?
It's never gonna happen.
Sure! It flushes it.
No! Forget it! Okay-I mean thanks, but I'm done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, what's next? Come on.
Well, just shimmy down me and drop!
What?!
Oh, no no no. Its for Ursula. I just figured, you know, size-wise.
Phoebs look, if you want to know what the deal is, you're just gonna have to ask him.
Arrrghh!!
Yes that's the one about the soldiers who fight in World War I!
Hey Phoebe!
Okay.
No-no, I don't really have any money. Not yet, anyway...
Huh. But still Ross, you're worst day with two women, pretty much better than any other day! Y'know what I mean?
Hey.
Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat.
That's horrible! Well, you did the right thing man.
No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?
Ross?
Oh, it was so amazing. After the love making...
Uhh, that's not them. I'm gonna go call the police.
Hey!
Did she just ask me out on a date?
Let's go watch it at your place.
No, no, no, don't say "listen." I know that "listen." I've said that "listen."
Nothing. It's just old and dingy, that's all.
Well Ahh, yeah! Yeah, sure, a drink sounds great.
Uh-huh.
Oh my God, you're back!
No that's not what I was going to say at all. No, what I was going to say is when you're 90 you'll still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old.
I bet I stopped listening before you did.
Hey-hey don't look at me! I just work here!
Yeah! Why don't you stick around. You can sit right there.
Oh I-I uh, found the keys and now I'm just polishing her up.
Whoa! And the... huh-huh?
He-he-he, how's it goin'?
Okay! Look-look-look, uh, if you're gonna be moving in with him I feel it's my responsibility to tell you the truth about him! Okay? He's a terrible roommate! Terrible! He uh, forgets to umm... Oh-oh he always, he always umm-Oh, who am I kidding! He's the best roommate ever!
Hey! Now, we're not actually gonna be sleeping in her, but do you mind?
Hey!
Yeah? I just figured y'know, after living with you it'd be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, y'know? Someone I can learn from, someone-someone who's different than me. And what's more different than me; a guy who's not 19 than say a girl who is 19? Enh? Not just a hat rack my friend!
Well, not that its any of your business, but, no, we havent, okay?
Did I say you could smell it?!
You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica.
Who's your friend? He's hot!
Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!
I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you! I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Mother-Kisser... I'll shut up.
How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free.
...is because they were friends first. Y'know? So I asked myself, "Who are my friends?" You and Phoebe, and I saw you first. So...
A swimmer!
Done!
Oh-Wha-Ho! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note!
Oh umm, not go.
Will you quit hoggin' it!
What about Game 1 of the Series?
You want my advice?
Bye!
Emily is kinda taking a long time, huh?
Why would you want to do that?
And while we're down at the video store, you know what else we could rent? Die Hard! Oh, y'know what? I just remembered, that Everest thing is only available through mail order.
Well that's true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great. My character's catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. It's really sweet and-and tender.
Y'know what, I don't think we should listen to this anymore.
Okay. I'm in.
Hey Pheebs!
Sure?
Ahh Pheebs, you know you're still my number one girl.
No no, uh, don't thank me for comin' in. Uh, at least let me finish. Uh, we could take the expressway but uh, this time of day you're better off taking the budge. You were goin' for the word bridge there weren't ya. I'll have a good day.
No! No! I am not a sex addict!
Hey Chandler!
He's right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that.
All right back off! I gotta gun! I'm not afraid to use it!
I got a gig!
I know!
All right.
No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!
A four and a nine.
Uh, don't you mean "for whom?"
I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is the greatest sandwich in the world!
No plans, huh?
Yeah, the man wreaks! Smells like he went on a three day fishing trip and then ate some liquorice.
Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.
Yeah, I know.
Oh yeah, no problem.
Look, I don't know why the kids need a youth center anyway! Y'know? They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine!
Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I don't think any of them are gonna work out.
Yeah, look how that worked out.
Ooh, hey, I know how we can decide! All right, uh, I'm gonna ask you a bunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast. Okay? So uh, clear your mind Clear it right out! Clear it out! Clear!
Are you all right?
Maybe this should be more of a quiet game.
C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!
No, not really. They give you all the information, it's uh, it's like memorizing a script. "And on your left, you have Tyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period.
Yeah, I guess it is. Listen, I ah, I gotta say good bye, and-and I gotta say it quick 'cause this is killing me. One thing you gotta know, is that I will never forget you. But, you've got things you have to do now, and so do I. And so... I'm gonna get on this spaceship, and I'm gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, you'll be long gone. But I won't have aged at all. So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne, baby, I'm gonna want to meet her.
Are you drunk?
Oh uh, can I give you a hand?
Sorry! Sorry.
That's okay. Chandler's the one I'm mad at.
Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it.
Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!
I took a shot.
Well if he's not gonna eat it, I will.
Oh yeah? If you're gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.
Pretty much, yeah.
Well, that's gonna be tough Mon. I mean it's hard for me to be around an attractive woman and not flirt.
Hey! Now I'm a man of the cloth, but I still have feelings!
Why would you need to say hi to them, you've been feeding them for four days?
Well, I can't use these forever. I mean, let's face it, they're no friend to the environment.
Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?
Fine. Gang up on me! I got you all right where I want you.
Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job. Like you'd believe that. This sucks!
We could climb Mt. Everest!
What's this?
Hey! I am secure with my masculinity.
Uh Ross! Are there uh, are there naked chicks on that piece of paper?
Yeah well, maybe you should go back! Okay? Rachel moves in, and before you know it you're right where you don't want to be! Back together!
Yes! Whew!
Oh, it went amazingly well!
Ohhhh man
I like it.
I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did.
How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?
Oh whoa-whoa wait a minute! I have to do it?!
Is that why you bought all this stuff?! Well, y'know what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and there's a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I'm not gonna eat! You know why?!
Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!
Hello?
Wow, it is easy. Now, I can have milk everyday.
Like a goalie, right?
Argh!
What?! I don't have 20,000!
Do you uh, do you-ready for a refill?
Okay.
Me too.
And there you go!
I dont care. Phoebes Phoebe. Ursulas... hot!
Art.
No-no, this only took five minutes. I spent the rest of the day coming up with new, Ultimate Fireball. Ha-ha!
Thank you! So, did-did he get it?
Uhhhh.... I'll just pee in the street.
Hello, Zelda.
Uhh, the ball thing.
And that's Wednesday. Ohh.
And I got custody of the kid, right? Now suppose the kid dies and-and I gotta buy a new kid.
Yeah, yeah, okay. Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown &#150; I'm trying to win her over, so I was wondering if..
Pizza!! We like Pizza!! Get out!!!
Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?
Hey Mon, do you have another pillow? Y'know, something a little snugglyer?
All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! It's not like he's...Chandler!
Hang up, hang up.
Okay.
Yes!
You're a dork.
"Take good care of your Momma son."
You think it would be okay if I asked out your sister?
Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.
That you're actually 50?
Well, first it's not a purse.
Yes! Shame about you man.
I can't tell you that, no.
And it's not fake, it's totally brutal.
How is this your seat?
Okay!
Whoa!! Now look, don't be just blurtin' stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?
No, we didn't even pay our cable bill-maybe this is how they punish us.
Huh.
I don't! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australian dancer.
Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.
Hey, is, is, is Chandler here?
Oh, no!
Hey Erica, c'mon in.
Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges.
No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents always lie. You know, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went another way', but this, I can use this. I canna work on a new accent.
Ohh, well, that's ok then. But, okay my towels for instance. I come in to the bathroom here and my towel is not on the floor where keep it. It's up here on some hook..and...smells different.
Ew! What is that? Something exploded!
They break your heart, don't they?
Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of sex.
Yeah, you did some real good thinkin' in there.
You've seen my huge stack of porn right?
No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! I'm serious this time! In-in fact, look, there's a-I wanna give you something. And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money. Now, I want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, y'know, thank you for being such a great roommate.
Hi, yeah, it's me. Oh, no no no, we're just friends. Yeah, I'm single. 25. An actor. Hello?
Theres the waitress. Excuse me, Miss. Hello, Miss?
Oh my God, you guys have no idea.
Nah.
Wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of being my agent.
Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything. I haven't dreamt about her like that since I found out about you two--ish.
Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place.
All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. And they're off!
Well, it's good thing you got out when you did, before she blew up like that Vesuvius.
No, things are fine with Kathy. I'm having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.
Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy.
I want to make a ship to shore call to Chandler.
Yeah right.
I gotta get the before shot!
Hello.
You do have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are you, are you crazy?!
Who?
Bob? Who the hell's Bob?
Yeah really, Ross, have you ever been beaten up before?
Iced tea.
That's so sweet. I'm gonna get some coffee.
Dude, you don't have to brag! We got nothing here!!
They're ribbed for your pleasure.
Duh, where've you been?
Who wants French toast?
But it's available now! Isn't it?
Obviously! So, how do we decide?
Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around?
This is where I keep the pizza. And-Hey! Where did the napkin go?!
What-what are you guys doing here? I thought I told you not to come.
Heh, heh. It was nothin'.
"Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!"
Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?
Huh? Uh...
Wow! Cool!
All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.
Hat, milk, got it.
Well, what am I gonna do Rach?! I don't have that kind of money!
What is Rock 'n' Roll about that?
Well, that is a large piece of television equipment. And uh that is an old man! Hey old man!
Ooh, that bad, huh?
Stegosaurus!
That's fine. I'll just have a Tic-Tac to hold me over.
Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey!
Alright, alright. Woah, someone's flossing.
Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?
What are you doing?
But you haven't even heard the chorus!
I don't know, it smells good.
Oh. Then, no.
Yeah, yeah. He's got a, he's got a really bad cough, and our vet, he can't do anything about it. Is there something you can do?
I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?
Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is she cute?
Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I like that!
Oh yeah-yeah. And I got the duck totally trained. Watch this. Stare at the wall. Hardly move. Be white.
I fall down an elevator shaft? What the hell does this mean, I fall down an elevator shaft?
Felicity and I, we're watching My Giant, and I was thinking, "I'm never gonna be as good an actor as that giant." Do you think I'm just wasting my life with this acting thing?
Really?
Oh, no thanks, I got it. No I don't!
Calm down, do you want this unit or not?
Hey, don't start judging me! Huh? You're the one who's in love with her assistant! Huh? And you, you're the one having the affair with the guy who keeps the pigeons on the roof!
Hey, hey, and I'm in the movie.
Give me $400!
Guggly worm.
I did it anyway.
No! No, I quit a long time ago. Did I forget to you that one? I'm sorry.
I'm sure it's a famous watering can, okay. But, come on...and what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom?
All right, relax. It's just a shoe.
Yeah! Yeah, I've been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe I would have if these damn boat shoes wouldn't keep flying off!
Yeah, for you!
Many are scheduled to appear.
Okay, I see what's going on here.
Oh, not my parrot.
What are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me?
Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it's getting darker and more painful, that means it's healing.
What is it?
Well to tell you the truth, they uh, they had a problem with the bag!
Yeah, that's what I was afraid of.. Okay, uhh...Look Janine I really want you to feel at home here, but some of this new stuff. It's...too girly.
Ahh!
Yeah!
Not like him, per-se, just not un-like him.
I'm gonna do it.
Not as upset as he's gonna be when he finds out what I did with his sweater vests!
Okay, Ross, look-look-look-look, look right here. That's called a scrum, okay? It's kinda like a huddle.
So did that do anything for ya?
Of course it's true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on?
Well, I like it. Here you go.
Whoa! Yeah, what the hell is that? What smells so bad?
Hey!
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk.
I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants.
The hell with hockey, let's all do that!
That-that is a good trick.
You are dogged man! I totally fit!
Hey, it's not like it sounds.
Oh and uh the guy who got the Paris trip is at table four.
Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it.
Yeah! Well, well really it's three. Please. You're so good at it. I love you.
Yeah!
Hey-hey come on you guys, give him a break. Ross, seriously, how's it going with her?
Nope.
The green bottle next to the shaving cream.
46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states?
What is with your nose?
Yeah, yeah, I met this woman.
Hey!
See you later, Gene.
Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left.
All right, uh... Oh hey, you've done this before Ross, well what did you say when you made up your vows?
Yeah
Do you think we'll get our three bucks back?
Do you have any respect for your body?
Okay.
I don't know.
Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.
How you doin'?
Hey, you know what naked card game is never boring?
I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!
Pheebs?
Yeah.
Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run!
Yeah.
Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island?
Come on Pheebs! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
All right, huddle up, right over here.
Oh, here I am, here's my big scene!
Hey, it's me. Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble.
Yeah!
Ross, hey, the band's ready outside for your first dance with Emily, so...
He's doin' some thinkin'!
Yeah, whatever you need. Hey, you wanna go home?
Man, I'm getting pretty tired. You're might have to take over soon.
Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember?
Nooo, I said we needed a new plan.
Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?
Needs some clothes altered?
Great!
Oh my!
Over there! Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said "No," you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!
Are you thinking about Monica?
So, does that mean the audition is off?
Consider it done.
I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?
I don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought that's what it was. Let me see it again.
Oh, they cut me out of the show.
Can you tell me how this happened?
Oh, I know how we can decide. Phoebe, show him your game!
Look, I told ya, I'm not going to any clinic! I don't have a problem, you're the one with the problem! You should go to a "Quit being a baby and leave me alone" clinic!
Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?
Hey, I'll be alright. I mean it's not like I'm starting from sqare one. I was Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives. Heh? I mean that's gotta have some kind of cache.
And you feel like we hold you back.
Well, there's gonna be strippers there. He didn't say anything about no strippers.
We just got the message.
Oh yeah!
What a tool!
..Naughty!
Hey.
Okay, fine.
Ohh!
This man is my God.
It's 4:30.
Ah! Huh?
Oh my God!
Okay. Uhh, tortilla chips, yogurt.
It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.
Me?! Oh come on, man! You can't do this! Come on! I'm your hand twin!!
What?
Yeah, o-o-o-o-okay anyway, I just wanted to say I'm sorry. Here.
I don't know! But it's the same!
Like this. Pictures of cute babies we don't know. We..we can't have that.
Hey, hey. How was the first day?
Hey, what's up?
What's the game?! What's the game?!
It's kind of embarrassing, y'know. I mean, I was an actor and now I'm a waiter. It's supposed to go in the other direction.
Hi! How are the Gellers?
I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...
You were right before. I mean, friends are so important.
Ah, are you okay?
Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago.
Hmm.
Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if I'm the best of the people they see, they give me the part.
You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it.
Why, are you moving out?
Hey!
Ahhh!
Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.
I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven't really paid the bill
Yaaahhh. Ahhh, candles. What'dya thinks gonna happen here tonight?
Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!
Yeah, you got a couple hours?
Oh yeah, I added three.
Would she? You ate my candy bar!
Hey, uhh, I need to talk to you.
Okay. All right. Umm, so uh, so how did it happen? Did your eyes meet across the room? And then the next thing y'know you're in the bathtub together and she's feeding you strawberries?
It's creamier.
She's comin'.
'Cause it's always somethin', you know, like Monica's new job, or the whole Ross's birthday hoopla.
How good is that?
Which goes where?
I'm so worried about him, y'know?
Oh. No! No wait, that's weird!
That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.
Pheebs! There you are!
Nah, it's okay. Right, Gunther?
Oh my God, I'm sorry, I'm being so rude. Rachel, would like a soda or something? Because Chandler would run right out and get it.
Hey!
Oh-oh! So that's the way it's gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too y'know!
Are you strippers?
We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man.
It's not my first time.
Yep. Ice Capades.
Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttin' up, eh?
There you go! Keep going. Keep going!
Oh, I'm-I'm not working tomorrow.
It'll be great for next weekend.
Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots.
Okay, imagine the best sex you've ever had.
I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know? Maybe a little longer.
Oh, hey, you guys are finally gonna get to meet Kate!
What's the thing you know?
Well, I think we all learned something.
Yeah, the Knicks rule!
Why not?
Here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.
Bastard!
The what?
Wha-
What do you got there?
Come on Pheebs! I can't take this anymore! Let-let me make it up to you. Huh? Ground control to Major Tom. Commencing countdown, engines on. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on!
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no... It's okay, I mean I-look Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday's thing, but we don't have to do that!
What was it?
Alright, alright, hey y'know fair is fair, if you're right, you're right, what can I say, but hey oh no!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What about you, having those babies for your brother? Talk about selfish!
What?!
Yeah, he's just really great to hang around with.
Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.
Wow! This girl is good.
Nope.
You sure? Some extra crispy? Dirty rice? Beans?
Yeah.
Kiss her! Kiss her!
Woah. Why do you get to keep the table?
That guy's still doing that?!
Um-hmm! Look, I-I-I don't know how much more of this I can take! Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if that had been porn?
You don't say.
I don't know, maybe I can't. I mean, maybe there's something wrong with me.
But don't you need experience for a job like that?
Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU. Hey, Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?
Oh, yeah, with the mug painting. Yeah. I was so listening to that. But ah, y'know what, I think I kinda need to work on my stuff tonight.
Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?
Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, "Hey, how you doin'?"
Don't you ah, don't you wanna ask me any questions?
Yeah! Wow, your like from a whole other country.
Oh, little party favours, check it out!
Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?
Thanks, you are such a good friend. And this is so weird.
No.
Joey. Hey Jake, do you like the Knicks?
It's not my first time.
Morning. I just uh, came by to pick up my mail. Where's the mail?
But I-I-I can't stay too long, I gotta get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow and I gotta look good. I'm supposed to be playing a 19-year-old. What?
Maybe we shouldn't pay our gas bill?
I'm sorry. See ya.
I got one. Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married?
It's between us and the sea, Ross!
Yeah. Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?
Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?
So you uh, still wondering?
And there it is.
Oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya.
Ah, anything we might of heard of?
I am so sorry man.
Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler.
What?!
Hi!
Huh? So whaddya think? Casa de Joey. Huh? I decorated it myself.
Yeah, it was! All right, listen, I can't...
Yeah! You don't like Kathy.
Yeah, you shoulda been there last night.
As in Rosita does not move.
Fight's over!
My animals. Hey the guy said they suited me, he spoke with an accent, I was all confused. I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's the pass!
Good for you. Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?
Yes!
Are you ok, Ross?
Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...
Hey, I see you guys already met, huh?
What's going on?
So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?
Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.
See, this is why I don't date women who read. Uh-oh.
You can totally tell! Here look, watch me. Smile! Frown. Smile! Frown. Smile!
Hey-hey, Ross?
That's all right. Hey you guys, you know what's going to be great about the fishing trip this year? When my dad gets me out in the middle of the lake and gives me that, "Joey, what are you doing with your life?" stuff. I can say, "Well, I'm doing a movie with Charlton Heston dad. What are you doing with your life?"
Oh, I do. How you doin?
Hey-hey-hey you made it!
Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me? Did you know this isn't Ma?
No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.
Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.
Sure! As long as they don't find out you can keep whatever you want! And I want you to have it.
Urse...
All right!
Okay.
Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and stuff.
Yeah, in a poem maybe.
Yeah, she's been out there for twenty minutes, I'm surprised you didn't hear her on the way over.
Are you kidding? I love that guy! Morning's here! Morning is here-
Ross! Get a shot of this. Hey babies! These are the headlines on the day you were born! Okay, now girl baby turn away and boy babies... Check it out, huh?! This is what naked women looked like the month you were born. All right, now let's dive right into the good stuff.
Sperm or regular?
Hey! It's Porsche!!
No you don't, I just saw you go in there with Monica!
Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!
What?! That's not fair! It's not my fault! I was off with my bride's maid! And who's to say I would've even said yes?! I mean I would've said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a deal out of this, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!
Hola, amigos!
I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y'know, you think I'll ever get there?
Ross has a boyfriend.
You think?
Oh!
Hey, what time is it?
Uh, I get Leslie out of the coma and then we make out.
Hello? What are you talking about? The audition's not 'til 5:00! Well, nobody told me! Who'd you talk to? Nevermind!
I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands...
Okay, Phoebe...
All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's poke. Steady. Steady. Okay, a little higher. Careful of the angle. Okay, okay, we're approaching the window Thread the needle. Thread the needle.
How little are they? I mean, are they like scary little?
Ow!
You'd tell me if you were moving out right
So uh listen, I think I'm gonna take off now.
Come on Rach! No one saw me take it! There was a whole table full of 'em.
All right, let's go Pheebs.
Hey Pheebs!
Hey-hey, who's your friend? Hey!!
Oh, classy.
Yeah and the most important thing is that it won't be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. It'll be me! And I swear I'll do a really good job. Plus, y'know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.
Hey Chandler! Y'know that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?
Ok, look, maybe I should just go.
No! I'm putting that in my room.
Can I ask you something?
Joseph's good, isn't he?
Hey!
You know those posters for the city free clinic?
Alrightalrightalright. There.
Bye, Pheebs!
Ross! They're gonna kill you!
Hey!
Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.
All right, I'm going. I'm going.
Whatever.
OK.
What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me.
Nooooo!!! Y'know what? Now that I think about it, I constantly find myself without twenties and you always have lots!
About what?
Well knock it off, you're supposed to be my friend.
Hey.
Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!
Don't do it!
I don't know.
Oh wow! He's so lifelike! Unbelievable! (He starts tugging on the guy's ears.
Aww, man, he took the five of spades!! Oh, no-no-no, here it is!
Fumble!
Did you not hear the plot of the movie? "She's been dead for ten years." I'm gonna be a millionaire!
Go Joe!!!
Why not?! I'm hungry.
Oh, yeah, I do.
Nice shoes, huh?
All right well, I'd better take that back.
Huh?
Look, the point is, there's a lot of women out there you haven't even had sex with yet!
Hey Rach, listen I was thinkin' uh, I'm gonna have an extra room over at my place...
Hey, Monica, wow you've been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.
Take the bra off.
Oh well, okay, good luck.
All right! Thanks! You're the best! Now listen, the last day of auditions is Thursday. Okay? So I gotta get in there by Thursday. Okay? Just remember Thursday. Thursday. Can you remember Thursday?
Yeah, yeah, and then Adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his waist.
Hey listen, why don't you come downstairs with me? There's some really nice girls down there.
Okay. I will. Ohh! Check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony! Huh? I wear it like this when I marry you guys, and then this is for party time.
Hey, hey, hey no.
Hey, you know about that?!
Why are you taking this away from me?
Hey!
Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man?
Well, I've just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paper that didn't have naked chicks on it.
Hey.
Hiya.
Oh my god, I got my very own stalker.
Hey!
I'm a man.
No!
I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.
Okay.
I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y'know, you think I'll ever get there?
We're 29, we're not women.
Oh-ooh, that's the turn-on.
No.
Oh, but hey look, at least let us bring the wine.
What?! It's 6 o'clock!
Hey, you're ah, pretty good at this.
Hey! Don't you hang up on me! I'll marry you and me right now! I have the power!
Hey, can you close that window Chandler? My nipples can cut glass over here!
You spit on me man!
That is so not my motto.
Alan.
And, and just so you know, if you wanted to expand this scene like, like have the cab crash or somethin', I could attend to the victims 'cause I have a background in medical acting.
Look, Ross look, I'm on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that's gonna get you in trouble.
What are you talking about? Bitch.
Oh, what are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me?
G-sharp.
Feminine.
Yeah! Okay! Hey! Hi!
Yeah, all right.
Okay.
So, you're just Bing?
C'mon, Ross!
Right, yeah. OK. Um, take care.
All right, hold on! Hold on. Hold on. This is Ross, okay? He's our friend. He obviously went crazy. He obviously lost his mind.
Hi uh, I'm Joey Tribbiani and with all do respect I'd like to donate some fluids.
I had the same dream!
Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. All right? Remember when Ross tried to say, "Butternut squash?" And it came out, "Squatternut buash?"
Y'know what Ross? I'm not gonna let you get away with this!
Yeah, hi. You guys got any of those baby chicks? 'Cause I was watching this ah, commercial on TV and man, those guys are cute!
That's an idea! Hey, if I hired an assistant, would-would you take money from her?
Uh-oh.
Yeah, did I fool ya?
So the ah, play's pretty great, huh?
Sorry about that. Thanks for waitin'.
Uh, I think he's in Rachel's room. See ya.
Glow-pop giggly jammer.
Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too.
Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little.
Oh Rachel look, don't say that, I think you just need a hug from Joey. Come on. Come on. She's back! Hot girl's back!
Hey!
Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?
Nope, got it and I got yours too.
Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial?
Ya know, one of these times you're gonna really be naked and we're not gonna come over.
Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. So when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes.
Yeah, I've had it.
Well I don't like to say it out loud, but, yeah! Don't feel bad man, we all have our strengths. You're better with numbers and stuff.
Ooh, it's probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, I'm kinda....
All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?
Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
Noo! I can't take any more secrets! I've got your secrets. I've got their secrets. I got secrets of my own y'know!
Who said it was for you?
No.
I don't know.
Thanks for coming Mrs. Greene. Well, ok, you take care.
Oh, here's where I win all my money back!
Yes!
Hey.
Ooh, I look good.
Felicity and I, we're watching My Giant, and I was thinking, "I'm never gonna be as good an actor as that giant." Do you think I'm just wasting my life with this acting thing?
Yeah! And you have so many more choices than you do with men's underwear!
Says who? Your mom?
I couldn't even if I wanted too.
All right, you know what we gotta do? We gotta get you outta here. Come on, I'll buy you breakfast, let's go.
No!
Wow! This looks great!
Did you call the cops?
Well so, how come you blew me off? Y'know? How come you were with him?
True story!
Oh.
Oh, I don't know.... Yeah, can't do it.
Thirty seconds left on the timer!
Oh no-no-no!
Yeah! Come on.
Hey! What's up?
Cool.
Thanks.
Hey, Monica, the knob was broken so I just turned it off from underneath, I hope that's alright.
That's mean! You really had me going there!
Hey!
We could get that Everest video though.
Hey Monica, what's on this video tape?
Oh, you weren't finished?
Hey.
Wow!!
Great scene yeah?
No hey Rach, it's cool okay? Y'know I'm a loner too! Right?
It's called Shutter Speed, it's really cool! Yeah, umm, I meet this girl in the subway and we fall in love in like a day, right? And then, she disappears... But I find out where she lives and when I get there this like old lady answers the door and I say, "Where's Betsy?" Right? And she says, "Betsy's been dead for 10 years."
I'm not listening to you!
Whoa!
I'll kick that door in if you give me a little sugar.
Get your non-believer ass outta my chair!
Hey you guys.
Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments, if you know what I mean.
Okay. "It's a typical New York City apartment. Two guys are hanging out." Ross
Then you do. Heh, heh.
Thank you. Wait wait wait wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am. . .
Phoebe, that's crazy. When I first met you, you know what I said to Chandler? I said, "Excellent butt, great rack."
Oh it was great. Yeah, you get to say stuff like, 'Hey, the bell doesn't dismiss you, I dismiss you.'
Hm-mmm.
Charity.
Oooooh...
Dude, you're not even man enough to order the channel that carries the sport.
Bwah-hah-hah!
What?!
Hey! What's up?
Whoa!
All right! Westminster Abbey! Hands down, best Abbey I've ever seen. Hey! Okay. What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?
Yeah?
Oh, yeah, good idea.
Yeah! And-and things aren't as...smashed down as I thought they were gonna be.
The Silly Putty! It's not so silly anymore!
Come on! It'll be fun! Me, you, and Ross, and... Paul probably...
Where is the waitress?! I'm starving!
Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.
Hey! He beat ya.
Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven't been able to stand up since. But um, I don't think it's anything serious.
So Pheebs what's this guy like?
Why? Is it because I'm friends with Phoebe?
I-I think everybody's pretending they don't hear you. Anyway, look, I don't know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, I'm telling you, he will sit in it! Ross! Ross! Over here, man! I-I saved you seat.
Thanks, man. And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card?
Wow.
Of course!!
It'll be great! We-we could talk, and play games! Huh? This could be our chance to like renew our friendship.
Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear.
Yep.
So you're gonna have to do it in the mess!
Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.
Whoa.
Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel.
Well how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani on attractive nurse receptionists.
Hi.
Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we... y'know each would, y'know be?
Hey!
What?
Wait a second, I see what you're trying to do here! You-you're trying to give me money again!
Well yeah, don't-don't you think it's a she?
Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!
Is everything okay?
Yeah, but I don't wanna die!
Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!
Hi everyone.
So what? Look, suppose we were a divorced couple.
Dude! What the hell are you doing?! God!
Chandler, come on nothing even happened!
Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo.
Yep! Looks like it's gonna be a leeeeean Christmas at the Dragon house this year.
All right, here's a list of things for you to do today. Man, this going to be so great! Thank you so much! All right, I got to go to work I'm delivering twins today, but only one of them is mine!
What? I have seven Catholic sisters. I've taken care of hundreds of kids. Come on, we wanna do it, don't we?
I like to see the previews. The candy.
Hey, I'm not interested in her sweater! It's what's underneath her sweater that counts. And besides, since ah, since when do you care who I'm going out with?
Later!
You'd better act surprised.
All right.
Oh, uh... don't forget your coupon. .
Who you what? Who you what?!
Well don't just say.
Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?
I know! Yeah, but, look I can handle it. All right? Look, I can listen to the radio, huh? And Ross gave me this great book .
Alright, now you say something.
What, like there's a rule or something?
Way to be strong, man!
All right! Just hurry up!
All right, here you go buddy. Go nuts.
Nothing. No, nothing.
Hey!
Listen, I know you're new, but it's kinda understood that everything from Young Men's to the escalator is my territory.
Yeah.
I don't know why you just don't say left.
I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, y'know, I just wanted to do a good deed. Like-like you did with the babies.
I slept with Monica.
It made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. Look, there's no unselfish good deeds, sorry.
So you're really doing this, huh?
Hey!
See ya! All right Pheebs, I am ready for my first lesson.
Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.
Hey Rach?
But I made cards!!
C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head.
If the Homo Sapiens, were in fact 'Homo-sapien', is that why there extinct?
Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross?
Baby shower. Wow! That sounds sooo like something I don't want to do! Later!
Oh that's great! Oh thank you so much!
It worked! I scared ya, I knew it! Ha-ha!
Need a new table.
Okay, it's a typical New York City apartment. Two girls are just hanging out.
Yes! Guess who's in an audition for a Broadway musical?
Thanks.
Wow! That was incredible! Beard of bees, here I come!
What, what are you doing? What are you doing?
Right! Okay.
Hey!
No. No way, I'm not signing that.
Oh! Ohh! Oh!!
All right I'll talk in code. Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?
Did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex with his wife and then fall right out of your chair?
What the?!
Fuggetaboutit. How you doin?
Me too! There's a game on Tuesday do you wanna go?
Oh-oh, what about Ross?
I'm sorry but we've got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in here. I, uh, I got to be a man! Okay. The living room has to remain a guy place, okay? That's just the way it has to be.
Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!
That doesn't sound like thinking to me!
Whoa, jam! I love jam! Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?
What's a matter Ross? What you're nervous about your speech?
Oh hey come on, don't-don't-don't do this! Umm, look let-let me tell you something, okay? Now when I watch you do a scene, I'm thinking, "Boy, she-she is a great actress!" Uh but-but, I am also thinking, "She is hot!"
Yeah, we're goin' to a Ranger game.
Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doin'. I mean, what if we're at her folks' place?
Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's! What? Thought we were trying to find stuff.
What?
Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it.
You guys okay?
Didn't think so.
Whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra, therefore has the biggest wire.
Hey Terry!
Hey! You guys! Check it out, check it out! Guess which job I got.
Now go! 'Cause you can still catch her! And Merry Christmas from you're secret Santa!
Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers.
No. No, I'm Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-I'm the guy in the coma!
Well, he's gonna. I'll see you a little later, ok? Hey, how ya doin'?
No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks.
What?!
Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?
No! No. Don't do that, just next time make sure she really likes me.
Good morning.
This is amazing.
Hey!
And Chandler I can't believe I let you pay for this one. Thanks man.
Yeah.
So are you gonna tell him?
Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.
I'm back baby! Ha-ha-ha!
All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough!! Enough! You two go home! I-I-I gotta talk to Janine!
Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.
One.
If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so.
Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming 'cause, 'cause her eyes keep going like this.
Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more.
Hi, here's the deal. We lost a carseat on a bus today. It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller. Oh, and there was a baby in it. He wants to talk to you again.
I don't know.
Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection. No stability. One day you're Dr. Drake Remoray, the next day you're eating ketchup right out of the bottle.
She's mad because I know today's her laundry day and that means she's wearing her old lady underpants.
Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?
Hey!
Uh, yeah, okay. Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to get ready.
Hey, how come, uhh, Chandler didn't come?
I-I can't handle this, you guys.
I don't want to move again!
Anything I can do? Whatever you need.
Yeah! Oh my God! Is this what it's like to be you?
Well maybe I got a little upset and maybe I told them where they could go.
So you're playing a little Playstation, huh? That's whack! Playstation is whack! 'Sup with the whack Playstation, 'sup?! Huh? Come on, am I 19 or what?!
I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.
Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department.
Hey, how was your chef thing?
What about the chick?
Ross has some big thing to tell everyone.
Well, you must be new here. Why don't we get a table and I'll buy you a drink.
Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?
Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.
Hey!
Hey.
No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally.
Uh, listen Phoebs, I know you're not goin' in there but do you think it'd be alright if I went in and used his bathroom? Oh, that's fine, never mind. Cool, snow, kinda like a blank canvas.
Yeah, but sandwich time is right now.
All right, we'll start with...apples.
He's fine!
Well-I got a head rush from standing up to fast right there.
Oh, ooh the food smells great, Mon!
Yeah, can you see me in a place like this?
Hey. That uh, that my sweatshirt?
Well Ross, it seems pretty clear. I mean what's more important? What people think or how you feel, huh? Ross, you gotta follow your heart.
I'm sorry, it just felt nice.
I discovered I'm able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.
You seen Sandy?
Dude, you should've gone out once and a while.
All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I'm gonna go see my agent.
Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready?
Okay, it all comes down to this. Whatever happens, happens. Destiny.
Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me.
Ross!
Yeah? That's so nice!
I can't believe it's Christmas already. Ya know, I mean, one day your eatin' turkey, the next thing ya know, your lords are a-leapin' and you geese are a-layin'.
There's my scene, there's my scene. "Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon. I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..."
Ross and Rachel left us a message saying they were getting married! Isn't that why you guys are here?
Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome.
R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?! And-and Chandler's tellin' ya how much he hates marriage?!
What? You ordered pizza without me?!
I'm just so nervous! Y'know? The callback isn't until tomorrow at five. I feel like my head is going to explode!
All you want is a dingle, What you envy's a schwang, A thing through which you can tinkle, Or play with, or simply let hang...
You should see the treatment I get when I'm with that car! People are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments.
Since then?!
Hey, here you go.
All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.
I can't watch this.
Phoebe! We're both your backup?!
Yeah, what-what's going on?
Because, Monica, the guy's so good, and I really, really want this part.
Yeah, unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons.
Hey Phoebs, if you want, I'll do it.
Uhh, because I'm shooting a scene right now. Yeah, I uh, I play a gladiator. Uh, y'know what? Hold-hold on a second. Can we cut? Yeah, my-my friends are here, I'm gonna take a little break.
Can we come it yet?! We're dying out here!
So what are you gonna do?
Didn't I tell ya? Always showin' off.
Wow! There's a lot I didn't know about vomit. In a minute.
Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!
Okay, can I-can I make it up to you? Huh? I'm sorry. How about uh, dinner tomorrow night?! I'll pay for myself!
Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do. . . so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, you know that's bad fo r the paper tray.
Eddie.
Ohh-oh, wasn't he cheating on you with her?
Ah, Gunther, I can't pay for this right now because I'm not working, so I've had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin' for stuff.
Sure you do, it was a gift from me. Oh! And you have these three great kids.
Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.
Well, anyway, I got to go change, I'm ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks.
The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybe they wanna sign me!
Well. I guess you think you're pretty special huh? Sittin' up here in your fancy small hall building. Makin' stars jump through hoops for ya, huh? Well y'know what? This is one star who's hoop... This is a star that the hoop-this hoop-I was Dr. Drake Remoray!
Hey! I'm off to my audition. How do I look?
I-I-I-I did?
Of course it was a line!
Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does, ok. If you try to pull somethin', he'll call you on it. 'What're you tryin' to pull,' he'll say.
The reactor's gonna blow in three seconds, we're never gonna make it!
Whoa-whoa-whoa. Jokes? You guys know they have naked chicks in there, right?
No?
Ooooooh.
The Ice Capades?
All right, all right.
Hey!
Yeah. You know why? 'Cause you came to me first.
What-But you saw the show!
What?! Why?!
Y-y-yeah! Yeah you do.
Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania.
Ha-ha, very funny-Look! I don't know what to do! I really want you guys to get along. Just please come to the movie with us. I mean you owe me!
All right look, let me show you the catalog! See? Huh? It's the latest thing! Everyone's got one! Men! Women! Children! Everyone's carrying them!
Quick volleyball question.
Boy, that guy's underwear sucks!
Noo! Nothing!
Hey, hey.
Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK.
No, I'm alright man. Really.
Okay!
Phoebe, this was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.
Sorry.
Really? 'Cause I could kinda use the money.
Monkey lover!
Yeah! Y'know, she could use a little... Oh nice shot!!!
If you want some privacy you can use my hole.
Uhh, Chandler's not here.
Nothing, I'm just practicing blowing you off because I'm gonna be a big movie star!
Aww, man, now we won't be bank buddies!
Nothing!
Come on baby, don't go. Please? What do you say?
Oh no, not you too!
Ross!! We're having a surprise party for Rachel!!
I'm not talking to you! You broke my fridge!
Where've you been?
What-what-what is so funny?
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...
Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in.
What is the big deal? It's not like we're exclusive.
Okay! Okay, you're yelling again! See that?
Hey, pretty smart! Tissue paper! You're at the wedding, you have to cry, "Handkerchief?" "No-no, I got my invitation."
Oh, I can't believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y'know? And it wouldn't matter. Now I gotta be careful?!
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find...
I knew I shouldn't have mentioned it! That's what I wanted to name my kid!
All right.
Ohh!!
See, there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office, but I'm still on TV and that's good exposure.
Oh. What?
Uhh Pheebs, I heard that. Can you put him on?
No. Why?
Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?
With this ring? No contest.
Well, she graduated from high school!
Why not?!
What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.
Listen uh, I'm really sorry, it looks like I'm gonna be stuck here for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the transmission wasn't there!
Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?!
You look like a freak.
No, I don't. It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you think that when you get it it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would be. But this so was. Ya know, it changed everything. Like the other day, I got this credit card application, and I was pre- approved. Huh? I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life.
Oh, very funny. I don't know if you remember, but my audition was supposed to be Thursday. You got me the audition?! Let's hug it up!
Ah. Hm. Wanna go to bed?
Yeah, this slow roasted salmon, just how slow are we talkin' here?
Uh yeah, where-where's the guy who decides who's pictures go up on the wall?
What, are you crazy? You haven't beaten me once since my injury plagued '97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.
Oh yeah, yeah, sure. Absolutely.
Uhh, this is it, this is how we're gonna die. Ready?
Oh well-Hey-hey! Maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing. Y'know? It'll-it'll give you a chance to shake things up, play different characters. You're so talented.
Hey man, what's up?
What about Andre?
She's not crazy is she?
Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.
No! I am not a pervert! Okay? It's just... I just... Kinda...
Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.
Mom, so what did you think?
Yes.
I don't get it. What happened? What about everything you said under the bridge?
You do?
Well look, hey, it's all your fault!
Can I tell you something? Me too.
Hey Pheebs! Listen, this wooden box keeps sliding out from under the seat. What-what is it?
Come, come here.
I can't take any...
No! No! No, not after seeing that.
Uh-huh. This and a bunch of bubble wrap. And, some of it is not even popped!
Well he actually saw you a little bit too.
Oh, I-I think I'm gonna stick with the V, I wanna see how this bad boy turns out.
All right look, y'know how-y'know how when you're dating someone and you don't want to cheat on them, unless it's with someone really hot?
And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
That uh, that is my roommate Rachel.
Why?!
Awww, one of my students got an audition. I'm so proud.
Yeah?
I mean come on you guys! My own TV show? I just don't know if I'm good enough.
Hey, Monica, wow you've been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.
Hey.
Oh, that's, that's ah, one of the old ones, he's just taking it to the back.
Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah.
I got fired.
Why don't we just go on two.
I know, it was amazing! I mean, we totally nailed it, it was beautiful.
C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all.
I don't know.
Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for... Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.
Maybe she never got your message.
Monica and Rachel made out.
Unless you wanna practice the Foxtrot again? Or-or the Tango?
Hey, you guys are still gonna come visit me, right?
Phoebe!
Yeah! Yeah, why? What's up?
Listen, sorry I didn't stop by last night but I had a date.
Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?
Uhh, well, she's...really good in bed.
They did it right there on the couch.
Oh, it's Ross's bachelor party.
It's a woman.
There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight, alright?
That's right, I have a phone in here.
Is to have a long, long talk. Y'know? Get Joey out on the open road and really open him up.
What's wrong?
We good? Yeah? Good? Once again, I pronounce you husband and wife. Now kiss her again.
Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.
Okay. See?! I told ya!
I was tired!
Thank you!
What?! He got me! Owwwwww!!!
Tongue?
Check it out!! Jam crackers!
Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink?
Are you kidding me?! She's gonna this boat!
Uhh, 11!
That's right, all the ladies want to stay at Joey's.
All right, but in the future...
No! No. But ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything in there.
Well it hit me anyway! And it would've hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer.
Hit me!
Hey!
So? Who would you rather have kiss you, me or Chandler?
You play hard to get.
Better?
The bigger half.
Okay that's fair.
Die Hard!!!!!!
This right here is where I keep the pizza. And uh that's where the napkin is.
No! No, you smell like a meadow. I'm sorry.
Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?!
Hey.
Wow, talk about your bad luck, I mean, the first time you try panties and someone walks off with your clothes.
Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture-I didn't have my camera!
What? What's wrong?
I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably should've told you about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg.
Hey, what's up?
Let's ride.
What happened? What happened?
No way! It's mine!!
Uh-oh.
Foxy lady.
Ross, you're mayor of the zone.
No! No-no. Look, there's a bug stuck in tar right here.
Yep!
Do you believe in ghosts, yes or no?
Oh uh, one of the writers.
All right, you're right. I'll talk to her.
Tell me about it, huh? Oh no-no-no, I'm not with her, she's just Monica! Ewwuck!
The part I want to audition for is a fireman, this is so meant to be!
All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!
Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love.
Ross, did ask us first, and we set that night aside.
Uhh, my stunt double. Yeah, and y'know, he's getting a little too familiar for my tastes.
Did I get it?
No. No.
Good.
Come on C.H.E.E.S.E., I'm not leaving without you! Try routing your backup source through your primary CPU.
If you didn't want to play, why did you come to the party?
Howdy partner!
The country.
No-no-no-no-no, I saw an ad for this video, people climb that thing everyday! We could totally do that!
No, no, I didn't mean you. But, you believed me, huh?
Hey!!! Oww!! And I'm bleeding.
All right, Ross!
Well, that's really a different question.
YOU KNOW!!!!
Hey.
Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not. Eh? All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket. I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs.
Transplant.
All right.
Come on man! You've been here all day!
That's right! And what are you not gonna do?
That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.
Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.
Cool.
It's been a while, huh? Wow, it's funny these halls look smaller then they used to.
I got time.
Oh, I know...
We're gonna climb Mt. Everest!
Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook.
"Heckles, you crack me up in science class. You're the funniest kid in school.
I don't want to marry Chandler!
You're driving me crazy with that!
Yeah.
Oh, you didn't see the Post?
Hey.
What did they do?
Hey Rach!
I fell down an elevator shaft.
Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.
I don't know! But he did not eat your face cream!
Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...
Yeah.
That's nice.
Uh yeah, right here.
Man, do you know what guys want!
Yep.
Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?
Hey!
Did you get your money back?
Yeah, all of us! All day!
What's not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Gooooood.
What picture?!
Yeah! That guy's all right!
Right!
Services? Oh, services.
Oh it's water under the bridge, forget it!
They have a kid together, y'know. They're like, they're like a family, and if, I don't know, there's chance they could make that work, I know I wouldn't want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. Are you okay? Do you wanna ah, come poke a nude guy?
C'Mon, You Guys. This Is A Real Movie, And Al Pacino's In It, And That's Big!
Eyes! No, no. Your eyes! No. Chandler's eyes!
Hey.
Hey! Ah!!
Listen, I know the invitation says 6:00, but does that mean that you want people to get there at six, or the show is gonna start right at six?
I don't want to drive all the way back by myself, I get so lonely. Oh-ooh! How about you come with me?
Hey.
Morning!
That makes sense!
All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.
Alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash.
What are you in love with her or something?
Mmmm. Good.
What did you say to him?
Yeah, I know exactly what she's goin' through.
Your folks are really that bad, huh?
Not a problem. And listen, hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while, why don't-I was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine.
Nooo!
Well maybe we just take that one away.
I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.
Here you go.
Oh that's too bad. I've kinda been saving up. Uh, are you sure there's no studies I can participate in?
I'd really prefer a mountain bike.
Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did? I'll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000! And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!
Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?
Great!
That's right.
Bikini, French cut, thong! And-and the fabrics! You've got cotton, silk, lace! And y'know what I've always wondered about?
Yeah!
So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
You don't keep it over here on this table any more?
Oh! Oh!
Oh my God.
Like what?
Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.
No kiddin', hmm.
I'm not going anywhere, sweetheart.
Hey Phoebs.
Aww, Rach, I think you look cute And you, uh, you, you I could eat with a spoon .
So uh, what are you guys doing?
All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all take a little trip together!
Ah.
Oh, now I have to go!!
I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.
Yeah, and she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.
Y'know, about what happened with us.
Yeah. All right, I'll talk to you later.
I don't wanna.
Look, I don't have it all worked out yet, but it's gotta mean big money! Come on! Identical hands!
Yeah, Rach, I think you're handling that really well.
Yeah-yeah, I noticed that! Is that 'cause she's so passionate?
Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight!
He hooked up!! Tell us about her!
No.
Hey, y'know you could always visit him.
How come you don't live with Mommy? How come Mommy lives with that other lady? What's a lesbian?
Is something wrong?
That sounds perfect!
What are you ah, what are you gonna do?
Cat.
Listen, do you guys think I have a chance with Janine?
But then you left.
Awww, man! He promised he wouldn't take the chairs!!
Who's birthday party?
Look at you. Since when do you roller blade?
Hold it hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple. It made me nuts.
How young is young Ethan? Young?
Ok. He kept my dollar.
Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right?
Naa, you're just sayin' that 'cause you're in love with Yasmine Blepe.
Ah, I'm-I'm walking down the aisle...Still walking. I'm about to pass the bridesmaid I hooked up with last night. Hey! I told her "Hey." And now I'm at the front with Ross. It's Phoebe. He looks pretty mad. Uh...I'd better go.
Oh that's mine too! I'm Italian!
Oh, a couple of nurses asked them out. Maybe they're with them.
Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right...
If I can't have it you can't have it!
Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can't figure it out! I talk to you and nothin'. You look at me, and it's nothin'. Nothing.
Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
Dark red.
All right, I'm gonna go!
.....Well, this is still ruined, right?
Hi!
No-no! I used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff, remember? Let's see uh, well I don't want to donate sperm again. I really prefer doing that at the home office y'know? Ooh-ooh, maybe they want like some of my blood or-or spit or something, huh?
Really?
Check this out. Can I have this?
Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried!
It really hit me last night. I'm gonna be on Days of our Lives. And then I started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives..
The Ross-Is that back?!!
I know, I know! What am I going to do? Ooh!
No I didn't.
I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
Aw, come on! It'll be years before I forget you!
Oh my, would you look at that!
Don't worry about that man, that happens.
No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity...anymore.
What?
The allergy guy got the part! Thanks!
Aww, man. That's the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out he's my roommate, she's gonna tell him what I did.
I ended up at Ross's place. Oh, I musta missed counted or something. Damn! She's not there anymore. Oh, l-l-look, Ross is doing his 'Watching TV' bit.
Oh well then, good night!
Umm?
Great! All right. I'll see you later.
Have you been here all night?
Hey no problem.
Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.
Hey!
Ahh, alright, alright, alright, I was young and I just wanted a job, OK. But at the last minute I couldn't go through with it so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can't 'cause there's people havin' sex on it.
Oh no, I'll be done by then.
Can I ask you something?
Don't worry, it's out there! I think I just need lunch.
I mean, there's no way I can make myself taller now, y'know? And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?
Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.
Angela? Joey Tribiani. Listen, what are ya doing tonight. I know your seeing that guy I was thinking maybe you could bring him.....Hello? Hello?
That's not what she said last night.
Dude!
No, only for sex.
Okay! How you doin'?
That makes more sense.
What?! What good is that gonna do anybody?
All right. Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge?
I'm not finished.
Of course I did.
No! Forget her, man! You don't need her, you don't need that!
This is impossible Monica, why don't you just pick all 15?
Hey guys.
Ow!
What are you talking about? It was a big deal. I mean, come on you can't tell me last night didn't mean something to you. I-I was there, you're not that good an actress.
Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.
Oh we flipped for it. I got the cigar, he got the moustache. Figured if we both grew it, we'd look like dorks.
Well you're whippin' so slow! Can't you do it any faster?
Hey. What, what are you doing here?
Yeah! Okay.
A book? Is it like a book that's also a safe?
I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right?
A little uh, good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure, now that's the kind of math Joey likes to do!
But you're spittin' all over me man!
What are these, like famous chickens?
Good for you!!
Oh, hey let me.
Hey man, look sorry about that Archie thing. Do uh, do you need me to give you some money?
Ma! What're you doing here?
Hey, thank you so much.
Chandler.
Oh yeah, yeah.
Yeah! If you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!
I've been trying for two days. When I called the restaurant, they said she was too busy to talk. I can't believe she's blowin' me off.
Oooh, what you got there?
I think we gotta end the freeze out.
Surprise!!
Oh, I don't know Pheebs. It'll be okay.
Well actually...
What 'cha doing?
Apparently, there's like a million guys out there that can play Mac, and there's only this one robot and this one guy who controls it! I didn't know he could get me fired! What am I going to do?
Yeah? Well, I don't want to talk to you Wayne! I hate you! You ruined my life! Oh, Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler.
You're blowin' me off for a monkey?
Nope. Man look at this! Ross, I can't believe you said you'd play rugby. I mean look how brutal this is!
She didn't have a birthday while we were going out.
Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt!
Or?
That's 'cause sometimes I just do it through my wall to freak you out.
Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends, she only talks to agents.
Wanna play strip poker for practice?
Anybody want a croan.
Ewwwww!
Well, the part's mine if I want it.
Totally! I would love to spend New Year's with you.
Okay Rach, that muffin and espresso, $4.50. Ross, double latte, $2.75. Chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25. And Pheebs, herbal tea, $1.25. So, all together that's $12.75.
Well, I guess you're right. Maybe, maybe I'll take her down to the incinerator. It's gonna be so said, and kinda cool. She's heeled!
Oh.
Aww, I don't want to see that!
Pheebs, who's Evelyn Dermer?
Rach, I told you everything I knew last night! Look, it's not that big of a deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it.
Oww! Big ring!
Hey. I spent the night out. I met this cute bridesmaid. She is so...
Come on! What are you doing?! I'm in character! Would you talk to her!
Yeah! Yeah! Right down there. Hey listen; let me give you a little tip. Do not take a nap on this stoop or you can wake up with your shoes gone.
Exellent dream score.
What are they doing out here? The coast's all the way over there.
Cute! This is Janice! You remember Janice?
How come you have two?
Yeah. I'll let you play with my duck.
Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.
Ohh, I know one thing!
Yeah.
Ohhh!
Her answer machine?
Hey Rach.
Do you want me to learn?!
Nice try. See the Netherlands is this make believe place where Peter Pan and Tinker Bell come from.
2,000 bucks is a lot of money. Oh, I wish I had a twin. Where could I find someone who looks exactly like me?
What?!
Not anymore. So anyway, how do you want to pay me?
Damn!
Kristen?
Oh.
Do what?
You call that delicious?
Yeah, yeah. We went to a Mets game, we got Chinese food, and you know, I love this woman. You have got competition buddy.
See ya!
Yeah bye-bye! Hey! So just a light layer?
Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an audition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather.
He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait.
You're kidding!
Are you all finished here?
Hey-hey! Stanley! Hey-hey! You're leading man is here! Let's get to work.
Hey! Hey! Be careful around my Porsche!
But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you're work cut out for you. 'Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she's into some other guy. So...
No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception.
That's great! That would be great! Let's do that!
He hooked up! He hooked up with someone.
Oh, it was great! I mean we walked all around the village. We went to this ice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but still... And guess what, I'm thinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts.
Here she comes. Hold on, I'm gonna make your life much easier.
Okay!
Hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant lady glow.
Look, you and I have been given a gift. Okay? We have to do something with it. Like-like, hand modeling! Huh? Or-or magic! And you know NASA's gonna wanna talk to us!
Great story! But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea... Oh man,
I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.
OK, alright, the people who threw the water.
I know! That's why we got to find Monica!! You know where she is?
Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you'd be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!
Chandler, is that...
I know. Yeah, his name is Pat.
Yeah! Okay. Phoebe, you look, I can't.
Oh come-look, when I was a kid my dad's company gave season tickets to the number one salesman every year, all right? My dad never won! Of course, he wasn't in the sales division, but still, I never ever, ever forgot that!
All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point.
Well okay, so then you're fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as it's hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It's when the heat goes away, that's when you're in trouble.
Sure, now I'm scared.
Hey! Chef Geller! Y'know that little speech you made the other day? Well I got a problem with it!
Yes, it's in my... In...in my pocket. My back pocket! My back pocket!
Hiya!
Here, I got five, I got five.
Yeah! All right? Let's go!
C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!
Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I'm not even sure I got it.
So! Things can go wrong! You don't know! What if he doesn't make it?!
Rach! Hey! It's fine! You're at Joey's!
All right, I should get going, big day a work. Y'know I'm in a coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out I'm not brain dead.
Ohh, a hunk of sandwich from last year.
Oooh.
Oh yeah? Well, you don't know about Hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal.
Ahhh! My ah, my agent said it wasn't a dancing part.
Guest.
Congratulations.
It was unbelievable! I walked in there and she was all over me.
No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don't know why you're pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there's a spot open.
Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?
Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.
Hey.
The ring is gone!
Ewww! Ugly Naked Guy is using his new hammock. It's like a Play-Doo Fat Factory.
He's got the body for it.
Excuse me, Aaron? Hi! Umm, I have a little problem with the schedules. Originally, I wasn't supposed to work today, and I have this wedding that I really have to be at. It's my best friend's, and I'm officiating so I really can't work past four.
Because it's faster.
Good luck.
No-no.
Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say. And with Joey, I pretty much have to make it up on my own.
Hey!
Yeah, yeah. Hey, why don't you give a pull on that rope?
Wow!
Kate, do you even like me?
Well, you know Chandler.
IN LONDON!!!
Hey! You wanna go?
Okay! When?!
Hey you guys, this is my agent, Estelle.
You?! And-and you?!
I can't. I keep seeing it the good way.
Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What about Rachel?
What's the matter Ross?
"When can you move in?"
Well can you at least stay to the end of the play? I mean, I'll go to the airport with ya, I-I wanna say good bye.
Wow, what-what do you think she wants?
I found my identical hand twin!
Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second?
Wow! You guys seem to be having a good time.
All right, I'm sorry. Rach I-Rach I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry! Maybe I can make up for it by, taking you roughly in the barn.
What is that?
WHOAA!!
There's like-there's like 300 bucks in this one!
For just you?
Sorry Phoebe.
Hair transplant.
Thursday's clearly not good for ya, pick a day!
Hey!
I can't tell you what I know.
It's not a cat!
Hey!
Well, I figured we're in another country, so it doesn't count.
No-no! No, I'm accepting it on her behalf.
If you wanna get back in the car, we need the wire, your call.
Oh and Okay, and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it, I learned something in acting class, try uh, rubbing your stomach or uh, or saying "mmm" and uh, oh oh! And smiling , okay?
Fine!
All right! But, you do it with me once.
Yeah, that was a tricky one. In reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours, but they only showed it for 2 minites.
What's goin' on?
We all hate Emily!
Yeah, I-I-I'm down with that. Okay, here goes. How you a-doin'? It worked! She's waving me over. Okay, I-I-I'll be right over. Let's see, she's on the third floor...
Yeah.
No! I won't leave you!
And what?! Did you sleep with her?!
Yeah, but, hey look, don't go through her stuff. She gets really mad.
Yeah, you can get a Volvo. If that's what you really want.
I'm tellin' ya that girl totally winked at me.
Hey, kids...
Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well, when Ross said Rachel at the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here.
No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole.
Fan out! Fan out!
Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I'm gonna do that.
Y'know what? Make fun all you want. This is a great bag! Okay? And it's as handy as it is becoming. Now, just because you don't understand something, doesn't make it wrong. All right? So from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact that Joey, comes with a bag!
That's what you told me.
Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die?
Wow, Pheebs! That sounds great!
Y'know, I can see why you think that, but ah, actually, you know who I think it is?
Hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! None of that, not while you're living under my roof!
Chandler, will you just come in already?
What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail. Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.
'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.
Uhh do it?
How come those?
Do we need a cake?
Hey.
Right, I go-, I got it.
Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good idea?
Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jo's manuscript. I don't see how he could ever forgive her.
See, didn't I tell ya these pillows would be a good idea?
Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.
Uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard?
No, seriously.
What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.
Hey Mon!
Yeah, okay.
Look at that, Charlton Heston eating a liquorice whip!
Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me. They...feel a little unwanted.
Argh!
Hey I-
I finished my book.
Hey, Rach? Sorry to interrupt but umm, Phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something.
Why did I have to start working out again? Damn you 15s!
Mine!
How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?
Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean!
Hey dude, it's me.
Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?
I know! I'm sorry! The guy's drunk, they won't let me go until we get this.
Hey!
So what if he didn't come! We can still go out and party ourselves!
And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be like, 'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'
My beers?! Look you guys, she's a very nice girl. Okay? We had a good time, but I just-I don't see it going anywhere.
Because, I'm not wearing any underwear now.
Pheebs, I'm so sorry.
I totally don't know what you're talking about.
This is crazy! Hey look, I wanna switch to Rachel!
Hey.
So what? I drove down, sold T-shirts, had a blast. And y'know who knows how to party? Drunk college chicks.
Hey, I'm gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to do it! He'd even make the girl pancakes! Plus, he'd make extras and leave 'em for me.
Yeah!
Y'know what else makes you wonder?
I'm doing my scenes with you?
No way! 'Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it's gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
You own the room. We should probably get-get uh...
Y'okay, Phoebe?
It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.
Right. No big deal.
Nooo, later.
Ah-ah-ah Mr. Smartie Pants, it's just not my character that's not brain dead. Hey, so Pheebs, we still on for tonight?
Phew, close one.
What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I can't, I can't tell you that, it's like the most awful, horrible thing I've ever done my whole life.
Yeah baby! No baby!
Oh my God.
I told you not to move it! Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted to move you mom, and you said don't, and I did it anyway and her head fell off?
You really think so?
Cage closed?
You're not gonna like it.
How do I look?
Hey.
She was nothing compared to you.
Hi Alex! And uh, as you can see my hands are not in my pants.
Olive loaf and ham spread, no mayo.
Oh, I'm sorry, Ross. I'll get it for you right now. And since I made you wait, I'll toss in a free muffin.
All right, all right. "Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart!"
See, now it's weird again.
I know! My grandmother's gonna see this!
All right, that's it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. But now, forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself.
Man this is weird. You ever realize Captain Crunch's eyebrows are actually on his hat?
Awww! Mel Torme died.
Done! I did it! Heh, who's stupid now?
Such as?
But you said one.
Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier!
Yeah, I got too excited!
Closeness-shmoshness! There was three of us for crying out loud!
Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed me.
Oh my God!!
Hey-hey, check it out! Check it out! Ugly Naked Guy has a naked friend!
My identical hand twin!
Maybe she killed him?
They want me to be totally naked in the movie!
The guy still won't put out, huh?
Hey.
....yeah... what else?
Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers they're just, you know, they're nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of a famous baby.
Oh... Can you imagine if I hadn't left you that last one? You two might've never gotten together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sent that hooker up to the room like I was gonna?! It's like it was in the stars!
Oh, all blank, and no blank, make's blank a blank blank. Oh no-no-no, no, the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they get away. Aww!
That's not whipped! Whipped is wh-tcssh!
That's not what I said. Okay, I just meant...
You got it.
Okay dude! Hey you uh, you sent Kristen flowers.
Is that why you're on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause if it is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone.
It's okay, these things happen.
Hey! What's going on?
Hi.
Maybe he, uhh... drives his car on the other side of the road, if ya know what I mean.
Ohh, get these things out of me!
It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! This is great! I'm getting more dates than ever!
All right, my New Year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar.
Y'know I don't think you should be talking at all in there! I think you've got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!
Dude, tell me she actually told you this.
Oh wow! Okay man, I'm sorry. I did not mean to make you feel bad.
Here you go. Let me ask you a question.
$200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did to ya?
Hey-hey, you're startin' to sound like the butcher's wife there in-in chapter seven.
Lookin' good Mr. Cotter.
Chandler's wearing panties.
Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man.
Let me see. Oh, right.
Really?!
Yeah. Uh, ...a slice......six dollars?
Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go?
We have a half hour.
Oh! Maybe they'll name yours after you! Y'know, they'll call it, The Ross. And then people would be like, "Awww, he's got a Ross."
"Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."
I don't know! But it's the same!
Whichever one you want, man. Whichever one you want. Not that one.
I know. Ross is getting married.
Anybody want to say good-bye to me at the car?
You know, uh... Chandler got you a gift, too.
These'll go great in my new place. You know, 'till I get real ones.
The Mr. Bowmont's here!!!
Wow!
Yeah, hero sandwiches.
Hey.
Haaaaa! Hey-hey, thanks for stopping our ball.
God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, 'Oh, I'm so talented.' and 'Oh, I'm so pretty,' and 'Ooh, I smell so good.'
Wait! Terry! Please! Look, I just lost my other job. Okay? You have no idea how much I need this. Please, help me out, for old times sake.
Dude, you soooo need this car.
How do we say yes now and make it seem like we're not doin' it just to ride in the cool car?
Ooooh! Freeze him out.
No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway.
Nooo, four.
Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is it's the same day as my niece's christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me. 'Cause my part's just in the beginning I'm not even in the rest of the show-Wedding!
Chandler?
What else?
Hey.
Uhh, Pheebs, those are uh, those are Santa pants.
Okay.
You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray.
I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler.
Oh, they gave it to me at the sleep clinic, and it's gonna help me not to snore.
Oh we kissed it up real nice.
Okay!
Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise.
Well, what if they came in third in a modeling contest?
Yeah, sure, spread some of that on there.
Phoebe's a porn star!
They let you get married when you're drunk! Most people who get married in Vegas are drunk!
I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.
Oh-no, don't try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.
Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and...
Nope.
Okay, all right, this is how it's going to work. We're gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest.
Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so.
I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise.
Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza. But, hey, look, if I get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper?
No, inside good, outside bad.
Oh hey, no, you're not welcome. Okay, look, I hate this! You guys keep embarrassing me! Yesterday, Rachel found your razor in our bathroom and I didn't know what to say, so I said it was mine and-and that I was playing a woman in a play. And one thing led to another and
What?
I know I don't have too! It tastes good.
Hey, I'm back!
Hey.
How do you mean?
Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!
Sure, if you cared enough to call it first.
So, Ross and Rachel got married, Monica and Chandler almost got married, do you think you and I should hook up?
Yeah, sure. Well, you must be new here. Maybe we should-I'm sorry, can I ask you something?
Oh, yoii. What was that for?
Yeah, she's gonna live with me!
Well, what did you have?
All right! Here we go! 1999! The year of Joey!
Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Hey Annabelle.
Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something might've happened to a huge chunk of it.
So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again?" Of course!
Yeah. What time are you meeting her?
Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that you're dancing with.
Yeah.
No, no... how come you are working here?
Hey! Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn't think big enough to fit a grown man!
Yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward, split five ways!!
Oh, I'm gettin' heat from the guy in the hot pink thong.
Pretty good.
Okay.
Can't help you, I'm not wearing any.
I don't know, she's, uh.... she's pretty great.
Hey!
Somebody was using his head. Hey, let's check out the rest of the place.
Okay, time to take off the bra.
You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel.
No, no, no!
Oooh, the next part's the best, when that dead lady in the bathtub...
That's right! I'm taking the essence.
Yeah!!
No. What?
Maybe that's the problem.
I know.
I did that too! They wouldn't give me her real name or her number. They said, "If I bothered them again they'd call the police." I said, "If you talk to the police, you tell them I'm missing a ring!"
...Yeah?
Yeah.
It's not that bad.
What are you still doin' here?! I told you, lobster ravioli!
Yeah, you don't want that.
No, I-I just heard lunch. But yeah, I can go. Sure!
No I mean it! I can't believe they would do this to you! And to your fans! I mean they are going to be devastated! Heart broken! They love you so much!
Hey, yeah! Then we could do that telephone thing! Y'know, you have a can, we have a can and it's connected by a string!
Where are you gettin' this?
Yeah! Yeah y'know, like warm up the crowd. Ask 'em where they're from. 'Cause in Joey Tribbiani you get a minister and you get an entertainer. I'm a minis-tainer! There is no one better! There is no one greater!
Okay, everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill my grandmother if she finds out.
Guys! Guys!! You gotta let me nap! Ugh, I'm gonna get cranky!
No-o-o!!
I can't believe I'm going to lose this job!
Psss, that is whack!
Yeah, the ah, trees that don't fulfil their Christmas destiny are thrown in the chipper.
Uh, okay, Pheebs?
Relax. Here hold this . This old stuff just comes right off.
Hey.
No! No! No Pheebs, I'm not gonna yell at you. I just y'know, started thinking about you and David and I...remember how bummed you were the first time he left. And I just... Oh Pheebs, come here. Are you okay?
Well, let me see.
Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!
Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?
Hey Pheebs, I'm so sorry.
So I just talked to one of the DOOL writers today, and...
"...Amy! Happy birthday to you!"
No-no-no-no-no.
Soon, soon, I'm gonna be on soon. There I am!
She's a woman!
Yeah, that's the uh, game we were playing.
Sure! I was there! Spring Break '81! Woo-hoo!
Oohh!! Ohh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh!!
I don't know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell 'em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.
I know...
See?
They're here already?
And scene! Huh? Wasn't that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah! Okay! So you-you-you-you were saying?
You sick bastards!
Pheebs, run!
Hey no, seriously, I don't need you to pick me... Alright! It still works.
Oh no-no-no-no, wait-wait-wait!!
I don't know, I was kinda hopin' no one would ever find out.
Done!
Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?
Are they? I didn't know I cared that much.
Well, the duck...
I don't know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.
I don't need that anymore.
Hey, Mon! I'm not doing anything, why don't you fire me?
OH YES!!!!!
Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing.
Sure.
Is she great or what?
That's what that was?! 'Cause that other thing? I thought you were on to something, but it did nothing for me.
I do. There's uh, let's see, Guy With a Mustache, Smokes-A-Lot Lady, Some Kids I've Seen, and A Red-haired Guy Who Does Not Like To Be Called Rusty.
And a 50. Huh, these must be Chandler's pants.
Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!
You and Rachel.
Hi!
All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot on there that you don't have.
Probably kill myself!
Is this movie gonna be my big break?
All right! You can have the chair.
Oh my... How much do you weigh Ross?!
Jo's there, but I don't think there's anything she could do.
Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang!
Sure! I would love to wait with you guys! Thanks!
Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again?
Oh great! Y'know I would've been perfect for this part, but whatever! Y'know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day!
Okay, you hide my clothes. I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you.
I'm so sorry. Look, if it was up to me you would never leave the show.
Night, you guys.
Ok, uh, hey Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks game and you had to choose between a friend who smells and one who bruises you who would you pick?
You're getting a cat?
Yes! There's still pie.
What?
Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.
Hey! Any good mail?
I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!
Y'know Terry, I-I don't really need to do this. I got my own cable TV series, with a robot.
You're right, I'm sorry. You're right.
I'm not wrong! I wish I was. I'm sorry. Bet that barium enema doesn't sound so bad now, huh?
Hey!
Ohh, I love birds.
Erin! Still here!
Oh, she's uh-uh really sick.
Sure, no problem. Ooh-Hey, donuts!
That's crazy.
Yeah baby!
Hey!
Okay, for next time, what do you say?
Oh, her ankles are a little chubby.
Oh yeah, that's right!
See look, women, carrying the bag. But it is odd how a women's purse looks good on me, a man.
The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limes-Hey, what was in that brown jar?
Takes it out of you?
Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.
So ah, Phoebe tells us you write jingles.
Oh! And so the miracle of life begins, and aaiiyyyeeee!
Well, I know what I'm giving you for Christmas.
Well, he's too shy, he doesn't thing he's good enough to dance with girls yet.
Well, don't get your hopes up, because probably not gonna happen.
Francette? What is she? A couch?
Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, it's says so in the script! Y'know ah, I-I don't know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that you're a bitch.
Hey, you're back too!
Ah, this is my friend Rachel.
She was nothing compared to you.
Pheebs, you gotta stop this, I working on commission here.
I don't know. What are you wearing?
Really?
Okay...
All right! Now you go get that beautiful pig! Oink!
You said I had to give you the chair, you didn't say anything about the cushions.
Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate.
I'm in it.
Y'know, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?
What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace!
Hey! I got great news!
Ah, he can't make it, he said he had to his... Whoa-oh!
Ooh, something hurts!
Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you.
You really think he'd take me? I mean, we had a pretty good talk last night but, when I moved out, I hurt him bad.
Yeah, yeah. It's like my chance to give something back to the acting community.
This body?
Got it! So...
Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.
And-and-and-and-and-and, and we're gonna be friends again!
You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there's this one other audition that I really, really want, and Estelle couldn't get me in.
Yeah.
Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...'
Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said they're gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders.
No he doesn't!
All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesn't mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise you're just an idiot in a box!
So...What?
We don't need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, we'll head down to the docks and see about that boat thing.
You talked to him. Are you crazy?
Okay! Here we go. Pillow.
Thanks! Okay-okay check it out! Picture? What picture? Eh?
Big fat goalie.
Well, why do you call him Gandolf?
Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y'know? Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It's all about turnover.
No-no, thank you.
This sucks! I didn't know I had to stay up all night before I went to this stupid sleep clinic! I'm so tired!
How'd you get over that teacher?
Well, I-I just, I just it was going to be like a really cool robot, y'know? Like the terminator or uh, when I first saw you.
What?
I was tryin' to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I'm gonna do?
Well, I'm makin money now and this is payin' you back for head shots, electric bills, and so many slices of pizza I can't even count. I love ya man.
Look, Chandler I don't think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. Okay? Just go and find Monica!
Sure is.
Dude, I am sorry about what I said!
Yeah!
Hey, what happened to your fancy chef's jacket?
You really think so?
Hey Monica!
Oh, I chose not to hear that.
Check.
You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!
Sure, it's hard to forget! But that doesn't mean you have to talk about it! A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never, ever talk about.
Okay!
Yeah!!
You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?
Yeah! I don't want you on the trip!
You have Knicks tickets?
What?
Well, they go into the chipper.
I was afraid of that.
I'd love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. She's sleeping. Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink?
Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
What? No! No Ross! No-no! Stop! I'm not jumping! Okay, look I have an audition tomorrow and I can't go if I break my leg.
Okay.
No.
Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper.
What? No-no it's her birthday!
Yeah.
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!
I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.
Wow. Thanks. So, uh, what happened?
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, y'know Ross, I think I kinda understand why I kinda lost it today.
I want to do it again.
I love that movie.
That's it! I'm tired of covering for you two! This has got to stop! Ahh! And tighty-whiteys! What are you, 8?
What?
Every night!!
Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!
Who cares? You're Rachel! Who's Kip?
Let's get out of here.
Hi!
You said number two.
You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?
Wh-why?
...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See, I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here.
Joey's your best friEnd. You want to make him a cheese sandwich everyday. And you also want to buy him hundreds of dollars worth of pants.
Dude-dude, who would you rather have kiss your sister, me or Chandler?
You just give him a spoon baby!
Maybe he found you flip-flop.
Hey, are you cool with this. I mean, I don't want to leave you high and dry.
Hey!
I can still hear you!
Hey!
Closed set. We know but we're friends with the monkey.
No-no, it's uh, it's Heston.
Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!
So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?
Huh.
So, are you ready to go?
Okay. Okay, okay, hey. There we go, let's get your feet up there. Good night, Kate. Sweet dreams. I'm gonna put this can right here in case you have to hurl.
Sure! Where are the seats?
Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes.
Okay, now uh, in terms of the invite list, I've got you, me, and Chandler and I'm gonna invite Gunther 'cause, well, we've been talking about this pretty loud.
Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something. Uh, I was just over there talking to Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight.
I think I know that girl.
No-no, not for like another two weeks.
Hey Gunther, let me get a lemonade to go.
Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?
Barmifsaed?
All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.
Come in. Thanks for comin' back, umm, okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and you are one of the finalists!
But it really...
Ross, don't let her drink anymore!
Well, we got plenty of space! There-there's still some over there by-by that speaker. Please, just stay!
No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!
Now he's movin'? Man, what is Emily doing to him? Ow!! He's not even here!!!
Do you guys have like a big bowl I can borrow?
I can't believe you. You told me it was a nubbin.
Nothing, he's just really believes in that.
Hey! We were just sayin', great apartment man.
Yeah-well-yeah! Yeah-oh-yeah. Come on in.
Yeah, I'm ready.
Guess what?
Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her?
We can't watch that! I mean that's Phoebe!
She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think.
Sure, neighbor come on in.
So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero.
Yeah! Well, I think we'll see if they actually let you play. Huh? I mean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like, "You look 19," and then they just take it away like-like, "No you don't."
Yeah?
Sure. So how long you been...
: That book got me through some tough times.
Okay well that may be true. But, in-in okay, Air Force One the Russians were terrorists! And evil! And plus he kills a bunch of them! That-that-that's offensive to Russians.
I guess you wouldn't believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?
Hey!
Relax Ross, we'll be ready. It only takes us two minutes to get dressed.
Yeah, you're right. Okay look, listen, let's talk about what a huge star I'm gonna be!
Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. All right, when was 1990?
Now that's a thinker.
He paid a lot of money for it.
That's right! I helped you guys out a lot in the start of your relationship. Huh? I helped you guys sneak around for like six months, and I looked like an idiot! And I was humiliated. And I only made 200 dollars!
That's...kinda hot.
You wanna make it 6?!
Ooh, I like that.
Hey, how do you spell suspicious?
Awwww!
Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea.
A little salami.
Food? Uh-huh gimme!
An annulment? Ross! I don't think surgery's the answer here.
I dunno. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even jolly, it's all political.
Hey-hey!
He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes.
Hey!
Hey, don't get religious on me, ok. A guy in your position needs to be a little better at relaxing. You know. Why do you think we have the comfortable chairs? Huh...come here...sit down. Ready? Ahh!! Ohh, yeah!! Huh?!
Yeah, but it's my wax.
Monica, how are you gonna do that?
Yeah, the stripper stole it.
Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!
I know, I know, but look at the knobs on her.
Just casually slip it in, y'know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh, I'm a loner-No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn't want to get mixed up with the likes of me.
So, you just left? Her place was really that bad?
Oh. Well good! For me. What is this? Did you give yourself a facial?
Exactly.
I will, really. I'll pay you back this time.
Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you.
Uh, Pheebs, about your mom...
Call it even?
Good luck. And I'm still right!
Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?
You do, thanks.
No ma'am.
Whoah!
Someone you didn't make up!
Can I talk to you for a second?!
All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat...
Oh, uh, okay, how, how about now?
Hi-hi, I'm Joey.
What're you doin' here? Aren't you supposed to be out with Rachel?
Okay.
Well OK then. Was that the oven timer?
Audition? I thought you were gonna offer me the part.
Naa, she's lyin'.
Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.
Hey, y'know what a really good rainy day game is?
Thanks.
Y'know what? I think that's enough for today. Thanks for your help!
I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday.
What? Mine aren't tinted.
No! Year! Happy No Year!
Hey, this is ridiculous. I'll tell you what. After I get back from my neice's christening, I'll go down to the coffee house with you and we'll all have a nice cup of coffee alright. No problem, Joey's there.
I'll take it!
Umm, hi.
Well uh, I don't know about who's here, but I can tell you for damn sure who's not here and that's Rachel!!
You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this, I owe you one. Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?
It's the Knicks!
Yes, I'm afraid it is. You deserve much better than me Erica. You deserve to be with the real Drake, he's the one you fell in love with. Go to Salem, find him, he's the guy for you.
They're brother and sister!!!
Can I change a hundred?
Yeah, we look great together.
Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laceys.
Alright. Cab driver number two?
Well I tell ya, I should probably buy a place in the city first. And I just got what you meant again-That is-I tell ya, that is a tricky one!
No, can we get back to me?
Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test...
Hey!!
When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is.
I don't know whether it's just 'cause we're breakin' up or... what, but you have never looked so beautiful.
Ooh, I'll play! I'll play!
Yeah, yeah sure, goodnight.
Come on! Look just-just tell-let her know that you really want them to be there. Let's not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years.
Hey!!
Oh yeah? Ross, how many items left in that bag?
Cool.
See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'. Can you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good mother.
Ma?
Gettin' drunk and going to a strip club.
Hey, Bonnie had sex there!
Or not. Uh, Rach, why don't you just move in with me?
Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now.
Sounds good.
Excellent! Okay umm, doggy.
How is it you?
Yeah, yeah, and the Indians taught the Pilgrims what it meant to be hot in the new world!
All right-oh! Listen, I know this is your party, but I'd really like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there.
Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure our personalities match. Okay, so I made up a little test. Now, I'm gonna say a word and then you say the first thing that comes to mind.
Bye.
Oh, hey, Monica, we've got a question.
Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together.
No-no.
Hey!
One! No ten! You said ten! You can't take that back!
Your different here too. Your mean in England.
This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas.
PBS Telethon.
Everybody's doing stuff!
Well... I'm helping out down at the N.Y.U. Med School with some... research.
Then why would you say that?!
Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.
Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
Okay, hey, museum geeks, party's over. Okay. Wave bye-bye to the nice lady. There you go. Back to your parent's basement. All right. Come on boys, come on out! Here you go. All right.
Well I guess I should've thought about my wife and kids before I talked back to chef Geller!
Hello Mr. Bing...I love you.
When is she leaving?
Oh! Yeah!
Glove salesman!
No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we'll be supportive like crazy.
Chandler?
I'm not Drake.
Well, you're timing couldn't be better. She's not my girlfriend anymore.
Kinda.
Our place, the hall! I...
Come on man, you drove all the way up here.
Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what woulda happened.
No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down.
Yeah! Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch!
Oh well, they're killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body.
And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees.
Okay, good, so there you go. Go with Vince.
All the time!
Yeah? Well look Ross, you don't have to. Okay? It's not your fault I suck. I mean what kind of an actor can't even say, "Hmm, noodle soup."
Stop callin'!!
We have to find the rest of the platoon!
All right! Man, this is unbelievable!
You can't go out there.
After!!
Okay look, Chandler, if this you have got to listen! You're gonna throw that juice at me, aren't ya?
Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there . Soo...
Now, wh-what, what is that like?
Thanks for telling me!
Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?
I bet it was about her a little.
All right, so we'll get a little coffee, and get energized, and we'll head back out.
Uhhh, I don't think you're gonna like this.
Hey! I made that for her!
And I was tired from digging the huge hole!
I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey.
Friends first? That's interesting.
Okay.
But sadly I could not be enticed.
Hey!
These little women. Wow!
Aaron! You gotta let me go. The guy's hammered!
Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!
Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast. You know, after having slept with her.
Look, it's a nice gesture, it is. But it just feels like--
I've got Ben.
I did do it, I'm a professional.
A woman in a man's body.
Great...Great...and thanks for being so understanding. I mean, I didn't want to make a big deal out of this, you know. You could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room. I mean, if you want to.
Pheebs!
Well check it out, I was with this really hot girl who just moved in right across the street!
Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive?
Ahoy!
And that's just in the city. I get her up to 160 when I take her upstate.
Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died?
Sure.
Kinda, but I've just been having way too much fun.
I just wanted to come by and y'know, wish you good luck on your date.
Hey!
It's almost as if he knew.
Now she sounded breezy.
Hey! No-no-no-no, you can't take him away from me! I got a great partner to pick up girls with! Finally!!
Uh, y'know, starve a fever, go to a play for a cold.
Oooh.
Hey.
Okay, here we go. Ready?
These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'. Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?
Look, it's not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I don't want to live with some one who doesn't know what it is to be a friend. So, I'll see ya.
Oh yeah, I definitely know her.
Oh-oh, hey-hey, Kate! Listen I want you to meet everybody. Everybody, this is Kate.
Well, that went well. Yeah.
Yeah. Well, so far yeah. But it's tough you know? I got all this built up flirting energy and I don't know how to get rid of it. How you doin?
Wow, that's, uh, dirty.
What?
Hey!
Yeah, you fogged Danny.
Two brothers, one died!
You're right! That did cheer me up!
Chandler, look they're actors. They're there to do a job, just 'cause they work together, doesn't mean they're gonna get together. I mean just 'cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn't mean it's gonna happen with them.
Huh.
It's not on my head.
So, you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything?
Because! You're mean on the boat!
Chandler! He's here!
Well, I didn't realize until I got home. I wasn't gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! Y'know what? I'm gonna go find that guy's car and leave a note on the windshield.
All right they got water, orange juice, and what looks like cider.
Hey, what's up?
Shhh! Man, you made me lose it!
All right!!! Okay!! All right! Okay-okay, I gotta get started on my speech! Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have sex right?
...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
So I guess you all saw it.
There will come a time in each of your careers when you'll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in the recent, present. And I'm ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now, he's got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me I'm stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you.
I'll get it.
Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?
Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me.
They're so small!
How do you figure?
Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! I...knew...you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us!
No, I had sex in high school.
Really?
Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. Y'know, because you don't want to be doing something and then look up and see something you don't want to be seeing.
Really? I can do it?
The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin' Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn't even get half a cup! Nothin'!!
Me too.
Hey.
And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...
Half hour.
I'm Joey. I mean, I'm disgusting. I make low-budget adult films.
No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than the first time we went out. Y'know? That was so awkward, we were really nervous.
I know I would.
Hey, don't get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!
All right. I can't see.
What?
What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!
Ohhh, here it comes.
Hey, listen you ah....
Not likely. 'Cause you see that body bag right there
Do something..... Something....
Okay wait-wait p-please be cool! Okay? I work with this woman.
Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break.
No, I-I figured you would've picked a blond guy.
No.
Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.
Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist too!
Hi!
They know you know.
Huh.
Good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it'll absorb some of the moisture and then you can get your pants back up.
Noo!! I've had the best day ever! Dude, check this out! Now, I'm gonna fastforward past the part with you, 'cause it is boring.
Booo!!
Fifty-six!
Hey Chandler. Come on in. We're knitting pot holders.
Yeah!
All right!
Okay, so what are we going to do about this hand twin thing?!
Uhh, hello Miss Buffay. I know where your dog is. I want you to know that he'll be returned to you, almost as good as new, within, within 24 hours. Uh, goodbye.
Hey, Pheebs!
I'm sorry, do I know you?
Y'know, I'm beginning to see what Jake was talking about.
I don't know! Yeah, I do.
Yes! And the table is mine.
Great! All right, so I'll call you later.
In a minute!!
Nope. Op, wait! There he goes.
Ok.
You wanna see what I got? Okay? I've got a baby Tootsie Roll, a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex, a rock, and an army man. Hey!
Oh yeah? If I can't, I'll knock five bucks off the price off the unit.
Hey!
The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up! But I figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they're gonna start to think that I don't own it. So I figured I'll wash it. Right? Monica, you got a bucket and some soap I can borrow?
Pick me!!
I want this part so much! Y'know? If I don't get this part I'm never gonna eat Macaroni and Cheese again!-No, I didn't say that! That's a lie.
Phoebs, that's OK. You took a big step today.
Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London.
Oh. Sorry!
There's just so much pressure. I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different. I don't know if you'd understand.
I just got this really weird message from Ross. He said turn on MTV.
Ahhhhhhhhhh...
No, they-they weren't in the play.
I just had a glass.
Or, I could just point to it! Huh? Blah, blah, blah, Purina One, point to a bag today. I didn't get it, did I?
Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to be. Yeah.
Well, I'm- I'm showering.
Look, when everyone eats that...that...Banana-Meat thing, they're all gonna' make fun of her, do you want that?
What happened?
Oh, Kath, we should get going. We're going to by hamsters.
Oh, yeah.
Uhh, excuse me is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table?
Or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them.
But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game.
Oh-ooh-ooh! Y'know what's a good visual aide?
Yeah, it must've fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit a dog.
All right!
Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross.
What?
Weekend at Bernie's.
That's right, $2,000.
I bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a VCR in our hotel room... we'd never even have to go outside!
Oh, man, she loved it! She's over there showing Monica and Rachel right now.
Naa, they said that when they found my body, my brain was so smashed in that the only doctor that could have saved me was me. Supposed to be some kind of irony or somethin.
Hey, the fight's starting!
So what're you going to do?
Ok ok ok ok. Monica, we'll bring him, but only if he takes the Jaguar.
What?!
Yeah, three days on the lake without a shower. Plus! I fell in that big tub of worms at the bait stand! Hey, how-how's he doing?
Instead of...?
Hey! That's the day after I stop menstruating! This isn't mine.
All that stuff you just said? I want that!
Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.
Oh, uh, hey Rach. I uh, I was just coming over here to uh... Oh wait, I don't have to lie to you, you don't live here anymore. Uh, I'm eating their food. What are you doing?
Five years.
Uh-huh.
Dude, Phoebe's mom has got a huge peni...
Sure I do! It's a verb! As in, "I behalfin' it!"
I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out. So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log.
Hey, imagine if I never got fired off Days Of Our Lives! Oh-hey, there's Carol again!
You spent a hundred dollars. That's the limit. You're screwed!
Really?!
Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.
What?
Okay, shoot.
Hey buddy! How's it going?
B-bye Janice. So when ya' dumpin' her.
I can't! It-it's stuck!
Glass of fat?
Cool.
Yeah baby!
Feel better now?
Well, ah, I'm an actor. I'm fairly neat. I ah, I got my own TV. Oh, and don't worry I'm totally okay with the gay thing.
I wanna rock and roll all night!
You may not kiss the bride. So, I guess by the powers vested in my by the state of New York and the Internet guys, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh wait! Do you take each other?
Right. Thanks. It's June. I'm outta here.
Hey, let's go look at it!
That's ridiculous! I'm not a "Star," just a regular famous actor.
Thanks! I've been working out. Hey listen, is it obvious that I'm wearing six sweaters?
Oh! Wait-wait! Is it my bologna sandwich?
Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any past life memories.
Huh, Rach I got to say it's gonna take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude.
Pathetic mess? I know, butcome on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching! Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this.
I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.
Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... "Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!"
No!
Yeah.
Really?
Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so...
I know! I know! And I'm going to talk to them about it. They mean so much to me. They... They're like my family. If you guys are gonna be fighting all the time, I-I... I don't think we can be together. It just, it just can't work. It can't. I'm very upset.
Ohh.
Oh, it's great! It's a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips.
Uh, y'know what, we're having second thoughts about our copying needs. And we'll need a little more time to think about it.
Hit me! Ohh man! Wait!
Great! Roomie!
Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous.
Hey!
I know!
That was one good minute!
Hey!
I don't know. I mean I like her a lot, and she's really nice, but...
I may have to, I hate to do it, but I'm the star! Y'know? There's a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor. Excuse me. Joey Tribbiani.
Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the strongest Power Ranger is?
Well that's like summer in a bowl.
Fine! Now, where'd we land on those pancakes?
Yeah, what's that like?
Hey!
Oh mama! Uh when-when is the baby due?
No, I'm performing the ceremony. I'm not wearing a tux.
Yeah, big!
Never had that dream.
Oh.
Yes!
Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot.
Yeah, you missed, 'Takes money to make money,' and uh, 'Don't make me come down there and kick your wall street butt.'
I finally get a part on TV and the monkey's makin' movies.
Alright, no peeking. No peeking, no peeking, no peeking.
Not really.
No.
No! Because he didn't believe in my movie! Which is a big mistake because it is real! Real!
Hey, are you unsupporting me again?
Shut-out!!
All right!
I have actually not heard of that.
Whoa! Is this porn? What did I do? I must've hit something on the remote.
Her what?
Yeah, she is. Wow! How you doin'?
Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I don't want that hanging over my head. Okay? Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in I can get all the free operations I want! Yeah, I'm thinking I'll probably start with that laser eye surgery too.
Hey that's what all my relationships are like.
Nice.
Hey Estelle, listen...
We've only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think I gotta get her something?
That's the title! Yeah! Y'know they really lucked out that the initials spell cheese.
I hate this woman!! I hate her! She told everyone in the company about that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. Okay, and whenever I can't do it, they're all like-like laughing at me.
Hey! Are those crab cakes? Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?
All right! Hey-hey!
Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.
Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.
All right look man, I didn't want to bring this up, but Chandler, is the stupidest name I ever heard in my life! It's not even a name; it's barely even a word. Okay? It's kinda like chandelier, but it's not! All right? It's a stupid, stupid non-name!
Are you kidding me? I never rent a movie without it! Oh. Uh, okay uh let me call you back.
Okay! All right!
Yeah-yeah-yeah, and they had that beer! That uh...
Hey Rach.
But what about how much taller he is than me?
Hey, everybody lies on their resume, okay. I wasn't one of the Zoom Kids either.
No no, seriously, Chandler and I were just talkin about this. He is so much cooler than our dads. I mean, you know, our dad's are ok, ya know, but Richard is just- ow, ow. What are you kickin me for? Huh? I'm tryin to talk here.
Oh yeah yeah. I process. People want the processing, I'm the one they call.
See? That's a great smile! Easy. Natural. Now, pretend I have a camera. You're changing it!
He's talking to London!
Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.
Hey.
What's twisted?
Really?! Well, when?
Yep! Grab a plate.
This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.
This is it! This is my category.
Aw! Look at that, every inch of this stuff is glued down. It'd take forever to pry this up. You should ah, you should just leave it.
Hey Pheebs?
Okay! All right, I'll see ya. We got it! We got it!
Yeah Bing, what's that about?
Oh, yeah.
You got to go on a ride along?!
Nice, nice. Hey I got somethin' for you. [hands Chandler an envelope.
Yeah, maybe he just cheated on you.
You bet! What's the part?
Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn't think big enough to fit a grown man!
Wow. Good speech.
Oh, it's this big budget period movie about these three Italian brothers who come to America around the turn of the century. It's really classy! Oh, and the director is supposed to be the next, next Martin Scorcese.
I don't know, Chandler is supposed to be passin' 'em around...
I know. Yeah.
Think it'll work?
I came over here to tell you guys.
We'll be there.
Huh? Never really thought about the writers. The scripts just kinda come to my house. But you know what? This makes me look good, which makes the show look good, which makes the writers look good so how could they be mad about that?
Uh hey look uh Ross, look I think we need to talk about before.
Oh yeah, sure, no problem, I'll just-hold on one second. "Hey Timmy, I've got a surprise for you!"
Yeah that dog left!
Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!
Man, I wish Ross was coming with us! Y'know? I'm gonna miss him!
You're smoking again?!
Hey, dude, let me in. I got a girl out here!
Ah-ha-ha, you guys owe me big time.
How do you mean?
You're fake laughing too, right?
No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so...
Well I didn't tell them!
Why would I return it? I love this bag!
Man, I got this close to him and Monica kneed me in the back. What's going on?
Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.
It'll be great for next weekend. I mean, it'll be grrreat.
Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, y'know?
Oh!! Shrimp toast!
Oh, well. Just ask her how long she's gonna live. Women live longer than men.
But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.
Boyfriend?
So, you and Angela, huh?
Okay, you watch too much TV.
I might know something.
Hey, here she comes.
Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex!
Ugh.
No.
Uh, wow, 700.
Hey! You guys! Remember that audition I had a while ago and didn't get the part?
Home is Home Star stew.
Yeah! Yeah. I'll be all right.
So Pheebs, do they know about each other?
And the best part is, we're filming in the desert outside Vegas! And you know what that means buddy!
Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry.
And that'll get rid of my wisdom?
OK, listen I've been on sets before, so let me give you a little advice, alright? It's a show, but we're just dancing, OK? It's no big deal. The important thing to remember &#150; stay cool.
What?!
Well, I sorta am. I mean yeah, I'm dating this girl who's also seeing another guy. But, I don't know, I'm not to worried about it.
You're kidding right?
Come on!
Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that's all. I mean, come on, it's just a little wax.
Pretty cool, huh? But if you're thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn't get sucked up into the mechanism, well you'd be wrong.
Yeah, well...
We didn't ruin it!
Yeah.
Okay. See you guys later.
Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, "Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg."
Well, we're, we're just goin' over here so that we can get away from the horrible flesh eating virus, for the love of God woman, listen to me. Is he lookin', is he lookin'?
I'm having surgery!
Hey!! We are so in luck! Treeger said that we could have all this cool stuff from the basement. Wait right there.
Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.
This is for my boat, pretty cool huh?
Then she came back with "The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a bomb?"
I call Monica's room!
Thanks! Let's keep going.
Yes, all right? All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there and they're gonna be, be drinkin' and dancin, and we really wanna go!
I don't know who made you the boss? All right? We invented this game!
He cut off his ear.
Well, we have to say something! We have to get it out! It's eating me alive!! Monica got stung by a jellyfish.
I dont know. I like her, you know. Shes different. Theres uh, somethin about her.
Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?
She's not even cold yet!
Yeah, I thought I was pretty good too.
Ah, it's career stuff. I don't know if you heard but they killed off my character on the show.
I don't get it! It was in my room all night! And if she didn't take it, and I didn't take it; and you didn't take it, then who did? Shh! We're trying to think!
Phoebs, what's goin' on?
Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you Chandler.
Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, I'd better go.
I will not take this abuse.
And, uhh, maybe the watering can there.
I'll never get to be a best man!
Yeah, we'll call that Plan B. All right?
I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out.
Why don't you tell me something I don't know!
Really?
Okay, here's my big scene. My big scene's here! Oh my God.
Yeah, right.
And a couple of these little tiny boxes.
You don't think my mom's sexy?
It's hard, y'know, his huddle is closer to Dutch girl.
And again, and again, and again... Hello? And again.
Look Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born, okay? Now, I have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks! What does that tell ya'?
I'm telling you man, I saw it.
Okay! All right. Umm, all right Wayne, level with me. Okay? I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired. Okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part! Come on man, you-you got to give me a second chance! I mean, I love-I love this little guy! Ah-ah!! Okay, that's why you didn't want me to touch him right? Here you go! Okay? Stupid! I can't believe it! God! Hey, how you doin'?
Woah, woah, woah, you have a date?
It is.
Yeah but we won't be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.
Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.
Yeah, we're gonna be fine! Get out!
I don't want them to move to a Volvo dealership!
Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy. I never noticed that before.
Oh yeah...
Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head!
I'd seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...
Luck!
Uhh, look, your eye's still popping out a little, I'm gonna go get some ice.
Right. Okay. Losing the robe. And the robe is lost.
Thanks sweetheart. Give me a little sugar here. Okay.
Oh my god.
No, but I'm gonna!
Oh no-no, it's uh, it's not what you think. We uh, we used it to, you know, fling water balloons off the roof. Remember that, those junior high kids couldn't even get theirs accross the street.
Hey.
All right! Hey, who wants pizza?!
And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks? You're the other one right?
It's never gonna happen.
Check it out, Giants-Cowboys.
And now for the great news.
Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want.
No.
What?!
That's-ah what I suspected-ah.
Yeah?
Hey! Hey Chandler look, I know you're mad, but I just want to say I'm sorry. I-I was a total jerk. Completely o-over the line. Uh, I just I hate pulp! Y'know? I mean, y'know how Monica feels about low fat mayonnaise?
All right!
Uhh, well I've got an audition down the street and I spilled sauce all over the front of my shirt. You got an extra one?
Hey, now you're the one who wet his pants.
I'm always on the swings! What am I doing wrong?!
It's my VISA bill. Envelope one of two. That can't be good.
No-no, she really is sick!
... It's a fertility study.
That was good beer.
Hey, see that? He just needed his pal to come home. All right, uh, I've got to go memorise my lines. Me and Charlton Heston bright and early tomorrow morning! Yeah-yeah!
Put it on.
Like this.
Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can't figure it out! I talk to you and it's nothin'. You look at me, and nothin'. Nothing.
But what does that gonna do...
Man, you are Westminster Crabby.
Well, so, stay for the museums!
I had a donut.
Hey, Monica, who would yours be?
Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, 'cause I'm heading up there.
Y-sure!
Look-look-look you guys, I need some help! Okay? Someone is going to have to convince my hand twin to cooperate!
But you're still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today.
Hey.
Wha? Wha..aa? Let me get the father. Hey, we need a father over here! We need a father!
No-no-no-no look no! I won't spit, and I won't stare at Monica's breasts! Y'know? Everyone knows I'm an ass man!
Yeah, you do!
Aw! Does that mean the Sam Goody's sale is over?!
Hmm, noodle soup.
But why?! I should've won one and I really want it and she didn't even care enough to come to the thing! It could also be a Grammy.
Yeah!
Okay.
It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.
Hey-hey.
It's just that, I, I'm gonna miss Joseph. I liked him. His wife, she was hot.
Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later.
Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies.
Hey Rach! Hey, you mind if I read my comic books in here?
I don't know Rach.
Looks good, uh?
Rach! Rach! Listen, I'm gonna kiss you at midnight.
Frankie? What're you talking about?
How come Richard looks so much cooler with one of these than me?
You're not stupid. You're meaner than I thought.
I'm Joey.
Why should I help you?!
Like what?
Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.
Nooo.
Yeah.
No, I really have to pee.
No.
Oh yeah, sorry about that. Mob mentality or whatever, I don't know...
First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just make stuff up!
Where you going?
Thanks. Thanks, but uh actually it's just gonna be me again tonight.
They do!
No, it's not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let you down!
Well, it's always nice to meet the fans.
Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.
Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?
Look, my best friends are getting married in like an hour. Okay? And I'm the minister. Please! Please! Can you pull it together?
Hey!
Yeah, I wouldn't know about that.
Huh.
Oh dear God!
Okay, Okay, Fine! Make Jokes, I Don'T Care! This Is A Big Break For Me!
Yeah, my agent just called me with an audition for Days of Our Lives!
Then why are you wearing Monica's jacket?
Hey, that coupon expires, you know.
Thank you.
All right now, memorize it. You got it?
Where's Kate?
No! No, I-I just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents, that was really sweet. They're so happy they get to be a part of your special day.
Hey, y'know what you guys? I think I'm gonna go walk her home.
Now, I wanna a suitcase filled with 100,000 dollars. Choo! Choo! Choo! Filled with $100,000 in small bills, and if I don't get it... Choo!! And if I don't get it, I'm gonna shoot this duck!
I wanna gooooooo!
Well he made Rachel cry!
No you won't. Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, he's sorry. But, you've got one more apology to make, all right, you've got to apologize to Mary-Angela.
Hey.
What?
What? Rachel, listen, have you ever heard of Fortunata Fashions?
That's good, just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time.
I got you something! Open it! Open it!
Funny one! That's good!
Hey, how much cash do you got in your pocket right now?
Careful! You're wasting good pastrami! Oh my God! I'm my dad!
I know what it did! Nothing.
Hey, I was pretty close. Uhh, so bad news. Umm, I can't buy the boat, I don't have any money.
I can do an English accent?! That baby's going on my resume!
It's better! You can't go to a museum in your underwear!
Yeah! I made it of this fruit bowl I found in the garbage.
And now Chandler! We're all gettin' so old! Why are you doing this to us?!
Hey...
Oh my God! That's huge! Wait a minute, why come I wasn't invited? And who was going to be your best man? Don't say, "Ross." Do not say, "Ross."
Somebody help me out here!
I thought we talked about this. I don't like pulp. No pulp. Pulp isn't juice. All juice, okay?
But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I don't know anything about technology! I can't even use Chandler's computer except to find porn! And-and that's only 'cause it's right there when you turn it on!
But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right?
Yeah, listen, before I forget that side is still wet.
Boy I tell ya, this little talent came in handy before I could afford porn.
How ya doin'?
Fine! Get out!
Ooh, so close.
That, is not a cat! {I have to agree with Joey on this one.}
Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya!
Hey, you know our phone's not working?
So y'know Ross it's funny 'cause, you look familiar to me too. Have you ever been married?
I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?
Great! I'm finally getting into this sailing stuff.
Alright, look, I'll start, OK?
Oh, now it's a spare room?
Hey guys!
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you had that whole Rachel thing.
Hey!
Hey Monica, it's Joey!
No-no, stay right there. Gettin' closer.
The big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and it's at the perfect angle so you don't get any glare coming of off Stevie.
See, this is a great apartment.
So I can do it?
Oh no, what happened?
Well, may I ask for one example?
Any one of the brilliant actresses nominated for this award tonight deserves to take it home. Unfortunately only one can. The nominees for Best Supporting Actress are from Passions Erin Goff. From One Life to Live Mary Loren Bishop , from All My Children Sarah Mchann, and from Days of Our Lives Jessica Ashley. And the winner is......Jessica Ashley from Days of Our Lives. Uh, unfortunately Jessica couldn't be with us tonight so I'll be accepting this award on her behalf. And I'm sure that Jessica would like to thank my parents who always believed in me. She'd also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Ross, Phoebe, and Rachel who's sittin' right there!
Well why don't you just reach out and take his trampoline.
They actually said that?
Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have $1200? I'm home in the middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess there's a few things you don't get from book learnin'.
Well, I'm telling everyone about you! That's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!
Come on!!
Uhhh, I was an impulse buyer, near the register.
By someone besides Monica?
All right, well I guess I'll just have to do what I do on dates.
Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles.
You don't think this is going to be a big break for me?
Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges.
Oh, I've been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche.
Hey, wouldn't be cool if our duck and chick had a little baby? We could call it Chuck.
Yeah.
You're really thinking about having sex with your brother?!
Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good.
Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. I'm thinking of getting me one of those.
The stripper stole the ring!! The stripper stole the ring!! Chandler! Chandler, get up! Get up! The stripper stole the ring!
Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear..
Maybe he's. . . gay.
So, you were both dorks. Big deal.
Hello.
Hi.
I don't know, maybe we weren't ready to have a chick.
Phoebe, could you do me a favour? Could you try this on? I just wanna make sure it fits.
Ohh yeah.
I know! That's why they trashed me!
Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?
Oh sure, go with the sissy.
You're kiddin'.
She told us.
What? Me having a job?
Yeah, it's okay. I know what a mainsail is. I know, I know to duck when the boom comes across. I-I know port is right.
Oh my God! You're pregnant!
I don't know. Just uh, just tell 'em it was a mix-up with the invitations, or-No-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the post office. And the Irish! But I don't think you can blame it on them so...
I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that I can't take care of myself. Okay? Look, I'm not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing that I'm gonna miss...is you. And now the dog.
So are guys doing okay?
She's right in there.
Yeah.
What's the matter?!
Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious.
Seventeen-fourteen Giants... three minutes to go in the third.
I bet 'ya ya I could fit in there.
Thanks a lot.
Wait a minute. That sounds a little familiar! Did they already do that one? 'Cause I think I read it!
Y'know, I'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad boys.
Dude!
Two it is. Ross, how about you?
Don't you think I asked him that before he got in?!
What are you talkin' about? I never left you! You've always been my agent!
Umm, okay.
All right Carl, we're next. Now remember, what is not gonna be?
Hey!
There's gravy?
I don't know! It's not like it's porn! This is a serious, legitimate movie. Y'know? And the nudity is really important to the story.
You bet I do! I just ah, wasn't listening then, that's all.
Yeah you do!
Hi!
Hey.
