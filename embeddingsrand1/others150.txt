You may kiss the bride.
Ah, cool! Taco shells! You know, these are... they're like a little corn envelope.
Umm, I thought about you all day.
I got asked out twice today when I was at lunch...by guys.
Yes, it is. Carol! Hi!
Exactly.
Oh great! Is it vegetarian, 'cause Susan doesn't eat meat.
Is this true?
Yeah! Punch him!!
It's me, Carl.
Yeah. No, this is great. Thank you, Chandler. .
Okay.
Ready.
So uh, Monica is Ross's sister.
I heard that.
Yeah, get out! Now!
Pretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of... radar.
You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We weren't happy. But with Mindy, now I'm happy. Spit.
Hey, no way, I'm in the shot man.
Well I tell you what...
So umm, are we cool?
But... Well now, now's a different time for me.
Yeah.
I'll survive.
I know a guy who's the 18th.
Oh! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Yes! Thank you!
So how do you kids like your coffee?
Oh, dear. Jack, how do I turn this off?
And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we don't just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there.
Oh, thanks for the tip.
Are you for Hanukkah, too? Because I'm part-Jewish.
Good-bye and God speed, Hope Brady.
OK.
Ok.
So ah, what's wrong with him?
Well, I just wanted to see where you lived. Now, give me the tour.
Yes, what's the name, please?
To get my coat.
I'd love to ask you in, but uh, my sister's visiting and I think she's asleep on the couch.
Oh, good. Thank you.
Okay, but that would actually be a big step down for me.
Drops!
Yes! Yes! You did!
Dudes.
My uncle dragged us there. But, it actually it turned out to be really interesting.
I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupid electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself! I mean, don't get me wrong... I'm not against environmental issues per se.... it's just that guy!
Heh... y'know?
Three.
Just for a coupla days. I got a job midtown. I figure I'm better off staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry. I don't know this one.
Whattaya say we make these, uh, coffees Irish?
All right.
Frank Jr. Jr.!!
Happy Valentine's Day!
No no no.
Chandler? What an unusual name! You must've had terribly fascinating parents.
Oh, we have our babies.
Or I'll call you!
Way to go son! I knew you'd find him!
Oh, no.
Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You're a terrible, terrible waitress. Really, really awful.
Pete?!
Okay. I'll miss you.
You have some life here, sweetie.
You must be Ross.
I don't need any toner.
Hi!
Wha-, n-, no. I mean it's just a bunch of pretty people runnin' around on the beach, ya know.
I'm Rhonda, and these aren't real!
Oh really? Well, then you'd better tell his other wife, 'cause she called three times asking where he is.
Hey!
Yeah, well, it scares me! I mean I not even divorced yet, Chandler. You know, you just invited me over here for pasta, and all of the sudden you're talking about moving in together. And, and I wasn't even that hungry. You know what, it's getting a little late, and I-I should just, um...
Oh, don't worry about it.
Can't you see what's going on here, this man is dead.
Oh sure. Vince?!
What?
Bing!
No.
That's right.
Cut!
Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive, he's been more loving... I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary.
Well, my nose got lonely.
OK, now before I go, does anybody else need to be picked up? I'm still gonna go.
Excuse me, I'm standing right here!
Great.
Bye.
Ooohhh.
Working with blind kids.
That was a great lecture today. Did you get a little hair cut?
How to make the next one even shorter?
Alright, let me just get my coat.
Bye.
Wasn't Nick funny when he couldn't get his match lit?
Jack. Could you come in here for a moment? NOW!
What about it?
Girls, sit down.
Jack, would you let it go?
I don't know. Maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you...
So what do you want?
Sir?
Hello
You always said I'd make it.
Bite me, blondie!
Hey, hey, hey there aren't any clothes in it.
No that's La Guardia. This is Mexico.
Ohh, listen. I've got to get going. Today was great, thanks!
So anyway I sent the designs over to Ralph and he's very excited about the line.
You don't wanna know.
A real doctor?
Yeah?
Which bedroom do ya want it in Miss Geller?
Ehh, y'know after high school, you just kinda lose touch. Oh yeah! I ran into Richard Dorfman.
Who's doing shots?
Joey, onstage!
Well then, uh, I uhh, guess that's me. Anyone else need to go on the elevator? Dr. Horton, Dr. Wong?
Why the Post?
Oh my God! Someone, he's choking. Is anyone here a doctor?
Speech! Come on Monica!
Do I know you?
I'll be okay.
So, do we have the best friends or what?
Okay! Okay!
Yeah, stupidly charming isn't' it? Well listen let's, you wanna get something to eat? 'Cause this place is kinda depressing.
Nothing?
Hello darlings.
Ooh, Can I have a napkin, please? Could you please hand me a napkin? Would you--Give me this thing all right!! Enough! And you are no longer my friend! We are finished! Nada!! No more! You are a bastard for doing this!! Get away from me!!
Have a seat son. Hey!!
Two years.
Yeah. I felt a little weird about it. You're a teacher. I'm a student. But would you maybe want to go out with me sometime?
Well, she'll understand right? It's not like I did it on purpose.
Shh! No! Joe Hill!
I'm getting my cigarettes out of my jacket.
She is kidding, but don't ever disagree with her again. Okay, now I'm kidding!
Sophie, get in here! You see! Now you're making Sophie uncomfortable!
Hey! Hey! This is ah, my fiance, Mrs. Knight.
Judy, going to the bathroom, good for you.
Hey, Chandler, why don't we talk this over at the Ranger game tomorrow?
Good-bye Chandler Bing.
Thanks.
Hey, I wonder if you can see my apartment from up here.
Rachel stop!
Would you like to call somebody?
So I was wondering....
The joke Bing. What's the matter with you?
Is that my ass?
Then, you're redoing it because...
Op, this is saved. Gift shop.
Oh don't worry, I'm not really a party girl.
They never did, so if ever see me giving them legal advice just nod along. Shall we?
$4.50 please.
Diet Coke.
