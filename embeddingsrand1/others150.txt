Well of course I am!
No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Kathy.
Why is this happening to me?! I don't know, maybe it's my wound.
Hi, oh, I'm Lauren, Kate's understudy.
Umm, Ginger's gonna take over this corner.
Scotch.
See what you did.
Okay. Have you started having contractions?
I am Father Kalebasous.
Hey Chandler, you can't keep your hands off her for one second!
Monica! Where are you from?
Okay, here he comes. What is he doing? What the hell is he doing?!
But... he gets it back, pass to the middle, lines it up and... BAM! Yes! Could that shot BE any prettier?
Ah-ah-ah, you know what that is?
Take thee Ross...
Oh, this is, this is unbelievable. I mean, first you sleep with my ex-girlfriend then you insult my inteligenct by lying about it and then you kill my fish, my Buddy?
Well, I don't know what to tell ya!
Oh, yeah!
Sure.
You're our third call tonight.
But... Well now, now's a different time for me.
What're you talkin' about, I was killin' 'em.
Wait, just a second.
Ok, yeah.
Oh, isn't Lori a doll?
I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she's still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available...
Crap!!
Are they, uh, firm?
Okay, errrr, Monica?
Any minute now.
C'mon now Phoe, don't still be mad at me. How's it going?
So who made her queen of the world?
We met with him. Did he show you the photos of the nude wedding he did?
May I see your boarding pass?
Chandler?
Are you travelling with a child?
You stop!
Sorry.
Yeah, we'll see!
Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.
No, I'm picking you up.
Awww.
Oh great! Oh, you. Umm, what's up?
Jack.
He says he was too.
You have really great hair.

Thank you.
Yes.
Please, let me do something.
This is the final boarding call for Flight 009.
Oh!
Okay. And don't worry, I'm not just gonna take you out for donuts.
I don't think you understand packing. Look, I just don't want to leave it to the last minute. Last time I left in such a rush, I left my knickers here.
What about my friend Victor?
Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late now
Wow. I'm sorry. Eggroll?
It is beautiful, but I'm gonna use this one. Now, if you'll excuse me.
The sexy blonde behind the counter.
Yes.
You are an idiot. .
Put your balloons down!
Hello, funny Valentine.
Morning!
No kiddin,' that's the exact same drink I made myself right after I shot my husband.
Kidney stones!
Oh, listen you guys. I have this friend at Bloomingdale's who's quitting tomorrow and he wants to abuse his discount. So, anyone want to come with me and take advantage of it?
Oh, Jack look, there's that house paint commercial that cracks you up.
Really?
Well, I'm so sorry. I thought I was leaving you with the best parents in the world, I didn't even hear about your Mom and Dad til a couple of years ago, and by then you were already grown up. I don't know, you're here, and I would, I would really, I would like to get to know you.
Well I guess on some level I always knew I was straight. I though I was supposed to be something else, you know, I'm an ice dancer, all my friends are gay, I was just tryin' to fit in.
Can I help you?
He's not here right now.
Oh my God!
Umm, Ross. May I have a word with you?
I can still see you!
Oh I know!!
Okay. I didn't know he was here.
Oh, hey look nothing happened.
Hi!
So, I hear, you hate me!
Okay. You ready to push again?
It's for me.
Good idea! Yes!
Hey! Me too!
Yeah.
You're taking this all wrong. Because, if I didn't leave you that tip, you wouldn't of come down here, we wouldn't be having this argument, and there wouldn't be this ah, heat between us.
Yes I can. Because if I go it means I have to break up with you, and I can't break up with you.
Carol, Carol, sweetie. Cleansing breath.
Hi Rachel!
Yeah. Oh.

Yeah?
Ah, that's okay, thanks.
Cheers!
Oh. God, crazy Chandler. He spun me...off...the...bed!
We'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's gonna set.
It'd be even more exciting if we were going.
Well, I'll see you later.
Well, if that's what you kids are calling it these days then, yes I am. I uh, I've kinda been waiting for the right person.
Huh. Yeah?
Oh, well just probably the worst one since I've been alive.
Scene 5, take 2.
Oh no-no-no, he's just I don't know, he's just a little bookish.
Your license?
Could you do me one favor, if it's not too much trouble?
What is taking so long?! I mean whatever!
Ok.
Okay.
Jen.
Oh, because I was thinking, the semester's over; you're not my teacher anymore.
We don't give anything away unless it's someone's birthday.
Well, we got into a fight 'cause ah, she said I was to immature to get married.
Yeah, we loves 'em. I've never seen him with-
May I help you ladies?
Gary.
Well, don't think I haven't noticed your potential. Well, I've got a project for you that's a lot more related to fashion. How does that sound?
I can't believe she's really gone. Look around you, all of this is ours.
Hmm.
Saltines?
So I'll see you at the party? Beer's beer man, 24, 7!!
Hi.
Ross.
I am?
I'll let you two guys get acquainted, huh?
What happened son?
Two pounds of Moca Java please.
Hi. Uh, did I accidentally drop a condom in your case? It's kind of an emergency.
Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood. Were you here waiting for me?
You know, in some cultures having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility. You get the best huts and women dance naked around you.
Professor Geller?
What?
We should?
Really? About what?
It's, uh, it's Paul.
Come on! You're just titling! Her legs are fine!

I-I do though.
I was thinking what it would be like to kiss you.
Schnoodle. Oh my God, what the hell happened to my dog?
What did Joey say? I like you back?
Hey pal.
Oh, I hate this but I-I-I have to go. I-I can't miss my flight.
Why aren't you at home in bed?

Oh, okay, I get it.
Hey.
Very tasteful.
Are those your teeth??
Rachel!
