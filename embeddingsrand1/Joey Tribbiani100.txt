Hey, you can't say you're breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy.
Oh.
That's right! And what are you not gonna do?
Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?
Whoa, wait, Pheebs, wait a second! Don't you wanna stay here and talk about it?
That's...kinda hot.
Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?
I wanna rock and roll all night!
Monica-Monica-Monica-Monica, listen-listen, listen, listen, would-would it make you feel better if we all stop talking about Ross and Rachel.
No, I-I just heard lunch. But yeah, I can go. Sure!
Really?
I know what it did! Nothing.
Man, I'm starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! "Do you want soup or salad?" Both! Always order both!
Rach, it's, it's ah, it's not that we don't want to, really. Are we talking models in their underwear?
Maybe she killed him?
Like you wouldn't believe. Wow! This is a great place.
So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that's nice!
Yeah, not it here it isn't.
Why don't you tell me something I don't know!
Can we come it yet?! We're dying out here!
Hey Terry!
Hey! What's up?
Rach we had to get out of there because, look what I won!
What?
All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad's cabin. Just me, her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic dinner....
That's right! I'm taking the essence.
A little salami.
Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it.
Oh, uh, ok. Right this way. All the other pregnant women seem to be goin' in here.
An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I'm getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me...
Hey!
Cage closed?
Glove salesman!
After!!
Nice.
Hey Pheebs!
But it hurt's my Joey's Apple.
Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!
Uhh, the ball thing.
That sounds perfect!
Foxy lady.
Mark's a genius!
I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did.
They're takin all my stuff back. I guess you were right.
No, that's VH-1. I gotta tell you, the music these kids listen to today . . . It's like a lotta noise to me. I don't know...
Hey! I got great news!
Yeah! I made it of this fruit bowl I found in the garbage.
No, no, you can't, you can't, okay, you can't, you can't buy her pearls, you just can't, you can't, you can't.
Yeah!
So, I guess this is it.
Yes!
I guessed 20,000!
Nooooo.
Who-ah-ho.
Like a goalie, right?
Hey, Phoebe, I asked you, and you said it was okay.
Thank you. Wait wait wait wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am. . .
I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal.
Great! I'm finally getting into this sailing stuff.
That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.
Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening?
Well, you know Chandler.
I figure my character has kids.
Noooo!!
Well, not that its any of your business, but, no, we havent, okay?
No-no, I don't really have any money. Not yet, anyway...
No, we didn't even pay our cable bill-maybe this is how they punish us.
I'm not going anywhere, sweetheart.
I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands...
Chandler! He's here!
Who's your friend? He's hot!
See ya!! What the hell was that?!
Yeah?
Yeah, someplace nice. How much do you think I can get for my kidney?
Phoebe! We're both your backup?!
Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?
Wow. That's almost as much as a new book.
Hey.
Whoa! This guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town! Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition!! I mean, way to go Ben! Man! I've been in that park a million times and no one offered me an audition.
All right, and over there is Brady's Pub where I like to unwind after a long day of surgeoning.
So uh, how you doin'?
So the ah, play's pretty great, huh?
No.
Yeah, I mean it's never taken me a week to get over a relationship.
Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while!
What?
Hey! Get into gear!
Hey. What, what are you doing here?
I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars.
A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That's the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?
Animals dressed as humans.
Well I tell ya, I should probably buy a place in the city first. And I just got what you meant again-That is-I tell ya, that is a tricky one!
Lifeguards.
Oh great! Y'know I would've been perfect for this part, but whatever! Y'know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day!
Come on baby, don't go. Please? What do you say?
Maybe he's. . . gay.
Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big? This is your baby. Hi Daddy!
All right look, y'know how-y'know how when you're dating someone and you don't want to cheat on them, unless it's with someone really hot?
Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!
I'd really prefer a mountain bike.
