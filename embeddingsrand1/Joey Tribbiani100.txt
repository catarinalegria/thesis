Anybody gonna eat that?
No, I'm good.
So?
All right! Man, this is unbelievable!
Hey, you know about that?!
No! No! No! For my new fridge-our new fridge!
I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore.
Hey you guys, check it out. Check it out. It's like it's coming right at me.
Huh? So whaddya think? Casa de Joey. Huh? I decorated it myself.
Yeah, all right. Ooh!
Whichever one you want, man. Whichever one you want. Not that one.
You sick bastards!
Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!
I might know something.
Good enough to get fired.
Phoebe?
No, it's just my luggage.
Monkey lover!
Okay.
All right, you got it.
Ma?
Don't you see what this means?! I can forget about that stupid movie. I'm gonna be a millionaire!
So what if he didn't come! We can still go out and party ourselves!
C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all.
What?
Hey!
Are you thinking about Monica?
See, this is why I don't date women who read. Uh-oh.
The Mr. Bowmont's here!!!
Yeah, where the hell is he?
Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming 'cause, 'cause her eyes keep going like this.
She is so hot!
Hey Jessica.
Yeah!
No.
Oh, very funny. I don't know if you remember, but my audition was supposed to be Thursday. You got me the audition?! Let's hug it up!
Yeah.
Yeah! Yeah. I'll be all right.
Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani!
You're a dork.
Relax Ross, we'll be ready. It only takes us two minutes to get dressed.
Me too.
Fuggetaboutit. How you doin?
You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica.
No, things are fine with Kathy. I'm having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.
Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome.
Yeah! Well, now that you brought it up, our fridge is broken. We have to get a new one. Now, I checked around and your half is $400. Thanks a lot.
Hey!
Later! Oh man! Hot girl! Hot girl!!
Nope.
Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?
I'll be playing Drake Remoray's twin brother, Stryker!
Yeah, we set up a court in your room. Uh, you didn't really like that grey lamp, did you?
No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed.
No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.
All right, I'm sorry. Rach I-Rach I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry! Maybe I can make up for it by, taking you roughly in the barn.
Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...
Oh, you said it Mike. Aw! There's got to be a better way!
Are you serious?!
Hey, what time is it?
Okay, for next time, what do you say?
Look Rach, wasn't this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff?
Yeah?
Problem solved.
Okay, great!
I'm Joey.
Felicity and I, we're watching My Giant, and I was thinking, "I'm never gonna be as good an actor as that giant." Do you think I'm just wasting my life with this acting thing?
Okay, great.
Well uh, I had breakfast here so technically I saved $3.50.
Oh that's nice. Happy birthday Rachel, here's some goo.
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wanna know how I did it, I'll show ya. When you handed me back the card, what you didn't see was, I looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye. I just did it. I just did it, again. Here, I'll slow it down so that you guys can see it.
Not likely. 'Cause you see that body bag right there
Francette? What is she? A couch?
That's not gonna happen. No. Because we have a new deal!
Wow, it's really long.
Wouldn't she?
Here you go. Let me ask you a question.
That guy's still doing that?!
Oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya.
Hi!
You ah, you forgot your shoes.
So are you gonna tell him?
Sperm or regular?
Yeah that dog left!
Hi! How are the Gellers?
That is so not my motto.
Yeah! Okay.
Glow-pop giggly jammer.
All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn't find out some other way. Did you think about the trail?
He hooked up!! Tell us about her!
Okay uh, look I know you're a great actor, okay? And you play all those Shakespeare guys and stuff...
But that's what...
All right, let's go Pheebs.
But uh, uh, what about uh, Ross and uh. . .?
All right look, Ross, he's right. Emily's great, she's great! But this way too soon, you're only gonna scare her!
That's uh, scenes from next week's show. Next week's!
Oh.
Well, it was a fight. . . based on serious stuff, remember. About how I never lived alone or anything. I just think it would be good for me, ya know, help me to grow or. . . whatever.
Right!
Wow! That's pretty nice. I thought he cut off his ear 'cause he sucked. What else you got in there?
