Yeah, y'know when we found out we were going to have a baby, y'know I figured y'know like I should y'know have like a career-and I love refrigerators!
No, she'll yell at me again.
Okay, so what you used to have with Rachel, is what I've got with Alice.
Okay, ah, see ya Pheebs.
I love you sweetheart.
Well, he may be now, because I think I hit him with my car.
Chandler.
Hey, honey! Okay, so did you find any apartments? Anything in Brooklyn Heights?
Oh no, I-I'm sorry, I guess we lost track of everybody after high school.
He went out with my wife!
Oh please!
Listen, it was nice to see you. I gotta run backstage.
What do you mean? Yesterday you said I was too pretty to pay for stuff!
I think he's stoned again.
Hi, can I help you?
Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you.
Hey Joe, you ever think about joining the force? We could use a guy like you.
Is this yours?
It's gonna be ok, just remember, we're doing this for Jordie. Just keep focusing on Jordie.
Dudes.
Oh, what are you, stupid? It's been three hours.
Yeah! Yep.
Ahhhh! I'm sorry!
All right.
He's says, 'Walking with you makes this strange city, feel like home.'
Did he call?
Oh please, I memorized those numbers when I was 15. But look at all the cool make-it-on-my-own stuff I got! This is my "Please, hire me" sweater. And these are my, "Don't you want to rent me this apartment?" pants.
Okay, okay.
Look I just thought that...
Look, you don't have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want.
Listen, I-I guarantee you keep your job if you can teach me how to talk to women like you do.
I know I haven't worked in an office before, and I really don't have a lot of experience, but uh...
A couple of hours, I feel awful.
No, it's about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now?
You slept with another woman?
You've spoiled everything! It's like a nightmare! My friends and family are out there! How can I face them?! How can you do this to me?!
The next station is Poughkeepsie. Poughkeepsie!
Dear?
Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.
Sorry, members only.
Flowers of Evil, by Beaudalire. Have you read it?
Yeah...
Mockolate. It's a completely synthetic chocolate substitute.
Yeah, it's my cat. Give me my cat.
Look, are you dating this girl you came with?
Yeah, sure.
Sure.
Oh! Yeah!
Hey, Chandler!
Ahh, ahh, excuse me.
Oh no!
Yeah, if I have to. Monica, I don't wanna lose you, so if I have to do it all over again, then I will.
Yeah, no we're not thirty. We're 31. Okay.
Well, I don't think this, y'know.
Look at you in the apron. You look like you're in a play.
I'd love some juice. Thanks.
No! It's because that way the camera only sees her! Do you wanna try it?
Well what is it? Come on sweetie, your like, freaking me out here.
Elizabeth!
Really?!
It wasn't on your list, but hopefully you'll think it's really fun.
Oh my God!
Yeah, y'know I feel like I can really talk to you 'cause y'know you're my sister, y'know.
Yep. Pretty much.
With a K.
Shh! No! Joe Hill!
C'mon people, back up please, back up, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon.
Okay! See you later!
So, I'll call you tomorrow.
Sure I do.
N.Y.P.D!!
All right, from the top.
I'll see you tomorrow.
...emblem of the land I love. The home of....
Alright, let me just get my coat.
You ready to go?
Ok.
What's going on?
Are you going to eat that bread?
Oh, like, uh, five minutes?
Yeah. You do know I was talking about you, right?
Ross? That opens my cervix.
Well y'know, he's blah, she's just-she's very loud for such a small person.
Pleasure.
Um, so listen, how many times am I gonna have to touch you on the arm before you ask me on a date.
What's a nubbin?
It's really nice to see you again.
No, no no no, you don't have to tell me anything. You don't have to explain yourself to me. Ooh, who am I to question the great Dr. Drake Remore?
Oh, I used to work with Frannie.
So what are you guys out doing today?
I'll be there, and who knows, if things go well, maybe this time I'll get to see your underwear.
Okay. It's just like anything else, you just have to get used to it.
Great. That would be fine.
What?
No, don't say it.
Okay, but isn't sex better when it's with one person that you really, really care about.
And Rachel shouldn't have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.
It really was. Oh, c'mere, sweetheart. Y'know, I think it might be time for you to start using night cream.
All right, I was 15, it was my best friend, Ruth, and we got drunk on that hard cider, and then suddenly, I don't know, we were, we were making out.
Wait a minute, hold it. Johnson! Will you come in here a moment?
