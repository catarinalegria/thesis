Take care.
Oh! Okay! Phew!
You OK?
Oh my God!
Hi! Hey!
What?
Hey, do you need me to pick you up?
Hello, Waltham Interiors.
I'll be there.
Well I'm sorry.
What?! What would make you think that?
Well, Ross and I were in grad school together.
Are you sure, I can crush a walnut with my butt.
Fortunately, I won't. And by the way, it seems to be perfectly clear that you were on a break.
Ah, cool! Taco shells! You know, these are... they're like a little corn envelope.
Obviously.
Nooo, it wasn't.
But, we are.
Thanks.
Y'know what? I may regret this but uh, I'm going to give you a shot.
Hello.
Uh, yeah. Now you guys dance over there, you guys over there, and I want you two right around here, and everyone else spread out.
Why not? You hate park views and high ceilings? C'mon I'll show you the kitchen.
That's quite all right, but I feel obligated to tell you that this meeting is being videotaped.
Ohh, no. Ugh. Oh, leaving London, my whole family lives there.
Hi-hi Joey.
Okay, Dave in the membership office, handles quitters. Uh, excuse me, are you a member?
No that's my assistant.
No, I was working on my pottery.
I can hear you through the ceiling. My cats cant sleep.
I can't believe we go on in, in a week.
Okay. Okay.
Screw it! I'm having one.
I will go for that drink.
Hey, Bob, it's Jade. Listen, I just wanted to tell you that I was really hurt when you didn't show up the other day, and just so you know, I ended up meeting a guy.
OK Phoebe, you ready to try one?
Really? Then why are you like that?
Wow!
Perfection?
How long is this gonna take? 'Cause I got another critic to go yell at.
Yay!!
Everybody has to audition.
Swiss quartz, ha, ha.
What?
Okay! See you later!
No-no, I heard what you said, funny. I like funny. This team is about hard work, but it's also about having fun. Good to have you aboard Bing!
Oh my God!
Hi sweetie! Are you leaving?
Yeah. I mean, I coulda done it better, but these people keep staring at me.
Oh no.
Oh, yeah!
No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phones.
Oh. Speaking of whom, I hear he's got some 20-year-old twinkie in the city.
Oh hi. It's, it's Mark.
Russians! It showed them as terrorists and villains!
Y'know, thanks for trying to cheer me up, but I'm not gonna date some random guy from your work.
You had sex, didn't you?
Yay!!
What one?
Kitten?
F.Y.I.. I've decided to pay a professional musician to play in here on Sunday afternoons. Her name is Stephanie... something. She's supposed to be very good.
Do you want to ride around town on my little pink bicycle?
I found it. Finders keepers, losers weepers.
I know, it's horrible isn't it?
And you! I throw myself at you and you say no, how gay are you?
It's-it's-it's almost dead!
Rachel, please, don't make a scene.
Buffay, are you going to plunge your stake into my dark places?
Uh, can I talk to you a minute?
Oh God, we just clicked! Y'know how people just click? Like he came by to pick me up, and I opened the door, and it was just like, click! Did he tell you?
That's my monkey. That's Patti, Patti the monkey.
Actually, I'm not here to complement the chef.
I was just coming over here to apologize for my behavior! I'd really like it if we could be friends.
Rachel, ready or not, here comes your knight in shining-Oh no.
Hi!
I'm sorry Amber. It's just like Brad to have to have the last word.
You're an Aquarius, huh?
Take it easy--if you want, there's cookies on the counter, or, or--sangria! I can make sangria!
You're so sweet!
Hey Rachel, what are you doing out here?
Eeaagh!
So, I think you're boxes are over here.
I can't until I'm the ultimate fighter. I will do it. I'm telling you, the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight, me or Superman. Now, I'm not saying I could beat Superman, but y'know, kids are stupid.
Do you ah, currently own a set of encyclopedias?
Oh damnit!
What did he say?
Oh my God! You do a great Chandler!
Oh, yeah, I don't like you this way. All right, I'll see you guys later.
Joey! It's Estelle! I just talked to the casting people; they loved you!
Sure.
Um-hmm, five actually.
Well then, uh, I uhh, guess that's me. Anyone else need to go on the elevator? Dr. Horton, Dr. Wong?
Well, think about it. It's always on the news. 'A man is being held up, at gunpoint.' 'Tourists are being terrorised, at gunpoint.' And I just kept thinking: why does people continue to go there? Oh, ah. I should go.
Why?
Oh hi kids. Hi darling.
Ehhhh... B-Buttons.
Oh, you're so lucky. My fiancee wants the heavy metal band Carcass.
Hello, sweetheart.
How did you know there was a but?
...and live forever as a machine!
