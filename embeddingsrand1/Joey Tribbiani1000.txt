Richard told Monica he wants to marry her!
Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, "Hey, how you doin'?"
Where is the waitress?! I'm starving!
Okay.
Of course I'm jokin'! I don't take checks.
No! I am not a pervert! Okay? It's just... I just... Kinda...
Ah, he can't make it, he said he had to his... Whoa-oh!
And, and just so you know, if you wanted to expand this scene like, like have the cab crash or somethin', I could attend to the victims 'cause I have a background in medical acting.
Oh, yoii. What was that for?
Have you been here all night?
Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is it's the same day as my niece's christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me. 'Cause my part's just in the beginning I'm not even in the rest of the show-Wedding!
Oh no-no-no!
Fine. Gang up on me! I got you all right where I want you.
Oh. Oh.
Yeah. What time are you meeting her?
Nooooo.
Uh, well they might be a little mad at me over there.
Who?
Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girl...
I don't know whether it's just 'cause we're breakin' up or... what, but you have never looked so beautiful.
Hey! You guys! Check it out, check it out! Guess which job I got.
Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my shot, and I blow it!
What if we have to pee?
I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her...
Wow! Huh? Mac Macaveli, Private Investigator!
Picture? What picture?
See?
Chandler's wearing panties.
All right.
So we are going on two?
I'm the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!
I'm not Drake.
Or not. Uh, Rach, why don't you just move in with me?
Did you call the cops?
Come on Pheebs! I can't take this anymore! Let-let me make it up to you. Huh? Ground control to Major Tom. Commencing countdown, engines on. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on!
All right. But if you weren't my best friend.
Maybe he could slip her the tongue.
The Celtics? Ha. They couldn't hit a boat if...wait. They suck, alright?
Likewise. Uh, I'll take that. It's what I came for. So, this is new. Where'd you two meet?
It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock! Huh?
Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project.
Oh, God!
Uh, I scratched it on the ATM machine down on the corner.
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot, or just fall down. That's good too.
Hey!
Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed me.
I-I-I don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, Ross is right back there.
Probably Monica and Chandler.
How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free.
Hey, I don't need violence to enjoy a movie. Just so long as there's a little nudity.
We have a winner!
Oh my God! That's huge! Wait a minute, why come I wasn't invited? And who was going to be your best man? Don't say, "Ross." Do not say, "Ross."
Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?
Uhh, just a minute officer!!
Uhh, 11!
No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole.
Dude, they're not objects.
All right! I'll try! But if I can't, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.
Hey!! We are so in luck! Treeger said that we could have all this cool stuff from the basement. Wait right there.
What are you mad at me for?!
C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head.
Hey!
You should see the treatment I get when I'm with that car! People are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments.
Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, it's says so in the script! Y'know ah, I-I don't know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that you're a bitch.
The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limes-Hey, what was in that brown jar?
Yeah, I can dance, y'know.
Great. You got anything that's not Ralph Lauren?
Monica, how are you gonna do that?
Can we see her?
So Monica, still going out with Dr. Boring huh?
Really? Thanks.
...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt.
You spent a hundred dollars. That's the limit. You're screwed!
Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn't think big enough to fit a grown man!
Oh, I don't know.... Yeah, can't do it.
Hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?
No-no-no! We gotta go! Come on! Here we go.
No!
What are you doing?
So are you gonna tell him?
I know! All right, I'll see you guys over there! I'm off to fight the Nazis.
Well maybe I love ya'.
Yeah, yeah, I met this woman.
Closed set. We know but we're friends with the monkey.
Look, there's nothing I can do for him right now, he's still in his sweat pants, that's still Phase One. Y'know? I'll be back for Phase Two, I would never miss Phase Two.
Yeah, we'll be fine.
Sure! As long as they don't find out you can keep whatever you want! And I want you to have it.
Dude! How come you took off?
What's up man?
Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.
Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy direct Burger King commercials?
Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. All right, when was 1990?
Which what?
Pretty cool, huh? But if you're thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn't get sucked up into the mechanism, well you'd be wrong.
No. Y'know how we're always saying we need a place for the mail.
Cat.
And we don't work hard?
That would be Casey. We're going out tonight.
Joey. Hey Jake, do you like the Knicks?
Well, thank you. So, can we play 20 Questions now? I've got a really good one! I've been thinking about it since Kansas.
A four and a nine.
Phoebs, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out.
Hey!
You got it!
Come on! When you go away, you-you have to play, it's like a law!
Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!
Who's seven?
Well, I'm- I'm showering.
Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother.
What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?
All right look man, I didn't want to bring this up, but Chandler, is the stupidest name I ever heard in my life! It's not even a name; it's barely even a word. Okay? It's kinda like chandelier, but it's not! All right? It's a stupid, stupid non-name!
Huh? Uh...
Yeah!!
Uh, some of her friends, yeah.
Ah, Gunther, I can't pay for this right now because I'm not working, so I've had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin' for stuff.
Dude, I am sorry about what I said!
Shut up!
Noo!! I've had the best day ever! Dude, check this out! Now, I'm gonna fastforward past the part with you, 'cause it is boring.
No, I wasn't gonna ask you that, no.
Oh, you have no idea. And-and when we're on stage I get to-to kiss her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it's like somebody's ripping out my heart!
Oh, well no problem there.
Yeah, so did I.
Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don't have time! They're just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.
No he doesn't!
Yeah, well...
I'm sorry, do I know you?
Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes.
Every night!!
Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me, here.
Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?!
Ooh! So close.
Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.
OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.
U-N-I-sexy?
I'm movin' out like we talked about.
Oh... Yeah, you do.
They let you get married when you're drunk! Most people who get married in Vegas are drunk!
Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this.
Yeah! Once.
Yeah.
Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya. I'm sorry man.
'Tonight' tonight?
Wow! There's a lot I didn't know about vomit. In a minute.
If you wanna get back in the car, we need the wire, your call.
Hey.
Oh my.
Yeah-yeah-yeah, and they had that beer! That uh...
The Ice Capades?
Yeah, they're mine.
Ya know, one of these times you're gonna really be naked and we're not gonna come over.
I don't want to talk about it. Y'know, you could've at least saved me a whole cookie.
Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she is, but at least with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out.
Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?
No, I-I just heard lunch. But yeah, I can go. Sure!
Uh-huh. This and a bunch of bubble wrap. And, some of it is not even popped!
Yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck got sick!
Oh and uh the guy who got the Paris trip is at table four.
Nothing!
Why don't you ask Chandler, 'cause he's the one that fooled around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that true? Or are you just gettin' over Janice by groping my sister.
Just casually slip it in, y'know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh, I'm a loner-No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn't want to get mixed up with the likes of me.
Yeah, that guy really hurt us.
Okay, retract the device, retract the device.
Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.
Ohh, then no. Maybe I should hear those specials again.
All right.
Ben! Ben! Ben!
Listen, I know you're new, but it's kinda understood that everything from Young Men's to the escalator is my territory.
But this is a two line part, it's like takin' a step backwards. I'm not gonna do this.
You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!
I don't think so.
Wow!!
Uh.
My animals. Hey the guy said they suited me, he spoke with an accent, I was all confused. I don't know what I'm gonna do.
So uh, what are you guys doing?
Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross's behalf. I-I think the rule applies here y'know, since she has a chance to get on broad back...
Oh sorry, I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross. Who-who's Barry and Mindy?
We just got the message.
Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!
Hey, what's up?
Althea!
Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio. Hey Monica listen is-is Phoebe there? I gotta ask her something about the car.
They know you know.
Look we've got to find her. Phoebe just called!! Rachel's coming to tell Ross she loves him!!
No, no, I didn't mean you. But, you believed me, huh?
Hey you guys, this is my agent, Estelle.
I like to see the previews. The candy.
Of course!!
What-what's wrong with Monica and Chandler?
Well OK then. Was that the oven timer?
Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges.
Yeah! Well, now that you brought it up, our fridge is broken. We have to get a new one. Now, I checked around and your half is $400. Thanks a lot.
Warm milk and Excedrin P.M.
No, no. He said "When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?"
What?
Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?
Okay, first-first of all, you want to make it look spontaneous. I look down , look down, keep looking down; then I look up. See? All right, now you try. Look down , you're looking down, keep looking down...
Yeah, well, it feels different.
Ohhh!
Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know....
Hi.
It is.
So uh listen, I think I'm gonna take off now.
What?!?!
Hey!
Yeah, yeah. Hey, why don't you give a pull on that rope?
Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?
Well, this has been great!
Can we come it yet?! We're dying out here!
They can't kill me, I'm Francesca's long lost son.
Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?
Hey.
Hey!
Here comes the beep, you know what to do.
I don't want to drive all the way back by myself, I get so lonely. Oh-ooh! How about you come with me?
Oh that's okay. Hey, actually in a way it's kinda nice. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!
Oh no, I'll be done by then.
You got it.
Umm, yum!
Come on Rach! No one saw me take it! There was a whole table full of 'em.
No, but he's...
Hey, thank you so much.
What message?
Well, when it's not right, you know it.
Well if it's free food, how come you're charging me for it?
Yeah but we won't be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.
Relax. Here hold this . This old stuff just comes right off.
Ohh great!!!
She's right y'know.
"...Amy! Happy birthday to you!"
Oh no! No!! My hole!!
Nooooo!!! Y'know what? Now that I think about it, I constantly find myself without twenties and you always have lots!
Wow! Well, uh... Hey! I'm really happy for you guys! Congratulations! See you later.
Can you believe this place?
What are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me?
Yeah. And uh, I paid for the other half.
Mother-Kisser... I'll shut up.
Oh yeah? If you're gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.
No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity...anymore.
Dude, I don't know.
Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!
Well, it's not a part, no. I'm teaching acting for soap operas down at the Learning Extension.
Or! You can just, y'know...
Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?
Is there a problem?
Hey.
Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!
Sure! But hey, you know this way sounds good too.
Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing.
Yeah!! I call that London style.
It does in mine!
Uh Rach, if you're gonna start another story, at least let me finish mine.
Hey guys.
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.
Fine! Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?!
Ohh!!
Maybe that's the problem.
Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots.
Y'know, there's two women dude.
Yeah, you can get a Volvo. If that's what you really want.
Yeah, it's for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. It's a very important issue in this month's Playboy. I'm sure you all read about it.
Hey, you know about that?!
Yeah, the man wreaks! Smells like he went on a three day fishing trip and then ate some liquorice.
Check.
: That book got me through some tough times.
Well you're whippin' so slow! Can't you do it any faster?
Me too! Me too! Me too!
What?! What's wrong with my eyes.
Hello?
Can I ask you something?
Whoa-whoa, don't we need to do some kinda preparation first? Like ahh, get really drunk?
Okay, maybe he's not his best friend, but ...
Well, we could do that!
Oooooh...
Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did? I'll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000! And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!
..ah, what're you doing here? I've been trying to call you.
Yes!
Well, I'm sorry. I thought parents were coming! Y'know? Your parents are comin'! Chandler's parents are comin'! Ross's parents are comin'!
Well, hey I did learn.
Umm, hi.
Hey, it's me. Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble.
We could climb Mt. Everest!
This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.
No.
Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment.
Oh, it's easy. Yeah, I-I can do it with anything. Watch uh, Grandma's chicken salad...
No! No! I-I can do it one more time! See? Look! Hmm, noodle soup. Damnit!
I totally don't know what you're talking about.
All-all right! Start it up! Let's go!
Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. Y'know, because you don't want to be doing something and then look up and see something you don't want to be seeing.
Oh, hey! Joey Tribbiani.
No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway.
So?
Takes it out of you?
Hey!
Hey, I'm gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to do it! He'd even make the girl pancakes! Plus, he'd make extras and leave 'em for me.
Nope.
Ah, now Rach, these ah, these little women.
Do you know something?
Yeah, there's this superintendent's dance, the Super Ball. I don't know, and he wants to impress Marge, this lady super that he's a crush on.
So then how could you I mean, how could you?!
Okay!
Ross, hey, the band's ready outside for your first dance with Emily, so...
Ross and Rachel left us a message saying they were getting married! Isn't that why you guys are here?
Ahhh, I fold like a cheap hooker who got hit in the stomach by a fat guy with sores on his face. Oh, I'm out.
The Ross-Is that back?!!
Hey, I was pretty close. Uhh, so bad news. Umm, I can't buy the boat, I don't have any money.
Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn't get it?
Hey!
You and me, next dance?
So why don't you give me your number?
I ran!!
Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo.
You can pee here!
All right!
You forget how many great songs Heart had.
Yeah, big!
Alright, now you say something.
Hey! Who was up from 2 o'clock this morning until 5 o'clock this morning trying to get her back to sleep?
We're now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, "I do" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!
Hey!
No! It's not okay! It's not okay at all!! You're dead inside!!
Yeah, it was! All right, listen, I can't...
Okay dude! Hey you uh, you sent Kristen flowers.
How'd you get over that teacher?
It's a woman.
I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
What-what is it, what is it?
Hey, you guys are still gonna come visit me, right?
We dare.
Thanks, Chandler.
Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour.
And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv-
Maybe she never got your message.
I think I'm gonna take-off.
Yeah, but I don't wanna die!
Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry.
All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.
And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be like, 'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'
Okay.
Hey Pheebs, guess who we saw today.
Now go! 'Cause you can still catch her! And Merry Christmas from you're secret Santa!
That's ridiculous!
So! You and Phoebe huh? How long have you been going out?
Really? I don't...
What 'cha doing?
Whoa, wait, Pheebs, wait a second! Don't you wanna stay here and talk about it?
I did. I thought it'd be great. I figured I'd have like, time alone with my thoughts but, ya know, it turns out I don't have as many thoughts as you'd think.
Hey...
Good.
Hey!
What's not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Gooooood.
Okay.
Yeah, Chandler finds me so intimdating that it's better if we're on the same team.
Well yeah, don't-don't you think it's a she?
What?
Ugh, I cannot wait to ask her out!
Uh, de-clawing cats. Hey, tell ya what. Let me walk you home. We'll stop by every news stand and burn every copy of their Times and the Post.
I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...
Y'know, I'm beginning to see what Jake was talking about.
That's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross!
What?
Wait a second, I could star in it!
So that's it? It's over? Just like that?
Oh yeah, sure, no problem, I'll just-hold on one second. "Hey Timmy, I've got a surprise for you!"
Hey! No-no-no-no, you can't take him away from me! I got a great partner to pick up girls with! Finally!!
Olive loaf and ham spread, no mayo.
North route!
Hey, don't start judging me! Huh? You're the one who's in love with her assistant! Huh? And you, you're the one having the affair with the guy who keeps the pigeons on the roof!
Uhh Pheebs, I heard that. Can you put him on?
Yep.
Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang!
Suck-fest.
What, so I gotta shut it down now?
Greens? I'm a Tribbiani! And Tribbianis quit!
Your chair?!
What?! Are you kidding?!
What?!
Hey. That uh, that my sweatshirt?
Oh, I know...
They have a kid together, y'know. They're like, they're like a family, and if, I don't know, there's chance they could make that work, I know I wouldn't want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. Are you okay? Do you wanna ah, come poke a nude guy?
What is the big deal? It's not like we're exclusive.
Hey!
Ah, are you okay?
Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman! And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition! Okay, look, if I have to pretend I don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about.
Oh, but when Phoebe has a problem, everyone's all ears!
Hey! How's it going?
Wow, what a cool job. 'You have two new messages.' 'Please, pass the pie.'
Hey! That's the day after I stop menstruating! This isn't mine.
Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads.
The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin' Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn't even get half a cup! Nothin'!!
Oh, well. Just ask her how long she's gonna live. Women live longer than men.
Is everything okay?
Hi!
When I was little, I wanted to be a veteranarian, but then I found out you had to put your hands into cows and stuff.
Hey.
It's between us and the sea, Ross!
That's not what she said last night.
You want to see her again, right?
"...by doin' it."
If anything should happen to him...
No. No way, I'm not signing that.
What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant.
Okay, what if the puppy said, "Help me Chandler. All the other puppies pick on me."
Yeah, she's been in there all day , uh high fever, a nose problem... Phlegm! Phlegm! Phlegm-phlegm-phlegm!
Oh no-no-no, you don't understand...
I knew that! I sooo didn't know that, but you should see your faces.
C'mon show us what you bought. . . You know you want to.
I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, y'know, I just wanted to do a good deed. Like-like you did with the babies.
Whoa!
Ah yeah-wait a second now! Look we're gonna have to set a spending limit on the date. I don't have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.
Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.
No. Nope, I uh...I th-I thought it might be kind of a cool character thing. Y'know? He's uh, he's a face toucher.
Sorry!
Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000. Can you believe that? $5,000!
Oh, OK.
She's not crazy is she?
I just got off the phone with my sister.
Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?
We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...
Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good idea?
But, but wh-what about us?
We don't make enough fun of you already?
No-no, this only took five minutes. I spent the rest of the day coming up with new, Ultimate Fireball. Ha-ha!
Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
You're not gonna like it.
Give me $400!
Are you all finished here?
No, never done that either.
The big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and it's at the perfect angle so you don't get any glare coming of off Stevie.
No, no, you can't, you can't, okay, you can't, you can't buy her pearls, you just can't, you can't, you can't.
Yeah, I guess it is. Listen, I ah, I gotta say good bye, and-and I gotta say it quick 'cause this is killing me. One thing you gotta know, is that I will never forget you. But, you've got things you have to do now, and so do I. And so... I'm gonna get on this spaceship, and I'm gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, you'll be long gone. But I won't have aged at all. So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne, baby, I'm gonna want to meet her.
Well?!
Oh.
Good luck, man.
All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn't find out some other way. Did you think about the trail?
You wanna see what I got? Okay? I've got a baby Tootsie Roll, a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex, a rock, and an army man. Hey!
Merry Christmas!
I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is the greatest sandwich in the world!
Joey Tribbiani.
Hey! Hiya!
I still haven't gotten a check for your half yet.
Uhh, this is it, this is how we're gonna die. Ready?
Oh umm, not go.
Yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward, split five ways!!
Yeah, he's just really great to hang around with.
Whoah!
I fell down an elevator shaft.
Ah.
What?!
No.
Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?
How is it you?
Yeah, whatever you need. Hey, you wanna go home?
Right-right up here.
Uh, does it hurt?
That uh, that is my roommate Rachel.
Woah, dude, burn.
Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I've never been able to cry as an actor, so if I'm in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let's say I wanna convey that I've just done something evil. That would be the basic 'I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it' Okay, let's say I've just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13. And that's how it's done. Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.
Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya!
You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it.
Oh-whoa-wait, Gunther don't-don't forget your shirt.
Freaky.
Do you have any respect for your body?
Get out!!
And what did he say?
Pheebs?
So, so how did it happen?
Yeah, we're goin' to a Ranger game.
Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?!
You're a dancer? She-she's a dancer!
It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.
Good morning.
All right!
Oh, it's Ross's bachelor party.
Come on man! You've been here all day!
Hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me?
Whoa, jam! I love jam! Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?
Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.
Thanks.
Re! Re! Then I can watch that! Rewind it! Rewind it!
Tequila!!
Yeah!
Oh hey come on, don't-don't-don't do this! Umm, look let-let me tell you something, okay? Now when I watch you do a scene, I'm thinking, "Boy, she-she is a great actress!" Uh but-but, I am also thinking, "She is hot!"
Sure! Why not?
So you've just married the one time then?
All right! Here we go! 1999! The year of Joey!
Guess what?
Hey dude, it's me.
I am so sorry man.
Uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-l-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that I, that I came up to you before was because well, I'm really nervous about-about being you. Y'know if you can help me capture the essence of the character. Y'know? Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?
Hey.
My scones.
Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?
Okay, take it easy.
Good for you!!
Chandler? What're you still doin' here, I though you guys took off.
I know! I mean it's not like we weren't cool about it.
You've got to pick a pocket or two. Boyyyyssss, you've got to pick a pocket or two..........
It's the Knicks!
Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?
No! I won't leave you!
..Naughty!
She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think.
Hello?
All right, but in the future...
Okay.
Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?
Pheebs, run!
Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.
You're smoking again?!
Oh-oh-oh, yeah! That's right, you take good care of those babies!
What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I can't, I can't tell you that, it's like the most awful, horrible thing I've ever done my whole life.
Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat.
Hey!
What are you guys doing up?
Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.
Porsche.
IN LONDON!!!
Oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya.
OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met.
Ross, did ask us first, and we set that night aside.
Of course it's true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on?
All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's great, but...
Yes sir! Yes sir, I'm-I'm-
Die Hard!!!!!!
You meant sex, right?
Come on, they're close.
Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. There's no meat in beer, right?
Okay.
Well my old man is doing a plumbing job down there and he heard they have an opening. So, you want me to see if I can get you an interview?
Bwah-hah-hah!
Hmm.
No you don't, I just saw you go in there with Monica!
I will, really. I'll pay you back this time.
Oh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay, maybe I'll talk about London! Y'know when you two hooked up! Only, only I won't say hooked up. I'll say, "Began their beautiful journey..."
Oh good! Can I tell her?! Can I tell her?!
I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?
I like her so much!
Great! Roomie!
They loved me!
Check it out, he's winning! Pete's winning!
Kristen Lang.
Guys! Guys!! You gotta let me nap! Ugh, I'm gonna get cranky!
It's no big deal. Hey, y'know, you do what you gotta do. Right?
Ohh, well, that's ok then. But, okay my towels for instance. I come in to the bathroom here and my towel is not on the floor where keep it. It's up here on some hook..and...smells different.
Oh no! No-no, keep reading! The good part's coming up. Keep going.
Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually.
Hey!
Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English.
Oh, I'm gettin' heat from the guy in the hot pink thong.
Those two only had each other!
Morning.
Pheebs! Sorry!
Okay, now the Mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic period.
Yep.
Thanks. Well but this one starts now.
Thanks! Let's keep going.
So what're you going to do?
Thanks sweetheart. Give me a little sugar here. Okay.
Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?
What's in it?
I meant female nudity. Alright? I don't need to see Lou Grant frolicking.
All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.
Yeah!
Yeah, I-I just made up the stuff about the wedding because I didn't want you to worry about me. But, I'm having surgery today.
Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?
Oh my.
They did it right there on the couch.
Oh God. Uh, okay, here's the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is...
Okay.
For the ride.
Like-like what?
I don't know! Charity?
How could this happen to me?! Yesterday I had two TV shows! Today, I got nothin'!
I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!
Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now.
Maybe you need sex. I had sex a couple days ago.
Was she happy you gave her the job?
Six.
Yeah! And-and things aren't as...smashed down as I thought they were gonna be.
Well knock it off, you're supposed to be my friend.
And the best part is, we're filming in the desert outside Vegas! And you know what that means buddy!
I didn't do that! Who would've done that?!
Right, and you go with Rachel, Bonnie's free tonight?
Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?
Okay, it's a typical New York City apartment. Two girls are just hanging out.
It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.
You can't make crotchless panties? You take, you take a pair of scissors and you just cut...
.....Well, this is still ruined, right?
Ross has a boyfriend.
Everything on your application looks really good-Ohh! Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?
Why is 10 the highest?
No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.
Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors!
Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember?
Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is really stupid.
Hey!!
Ah-ha-ha, you guys owe me big time.
Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey!
Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while!
So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe... huh-huh?
What's the big deal, sit somewhere else.
Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7.
No! No, you smell like a meadow. I'm sorry.
So anyway, I'm trying to get my boss's ex-wife to sleep with me. . .
Maybe she killed him?
They gave me the shaft all right.
Uh listen, here's your Soapie. I accepted it for ya.
All right, let's get me back up there!
If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you.
Hey!
Well then let me do it!
Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
I wanna rock and roll all night!
We're the guys.
Yeah, I got too excited!
No, but if you're willing to cook naked, then you might be willing to dance naked. And then...
She's my biggest fan. Yeah, she's the only one in the family that's believed in me.
We're gonna climb Mt. Everest!
Sure! It flushes it.
Yeah. Well, so far yeah. But it's tough you know? I got all this built up flirting energy and I don't know how to get rid of it. How you doin?
Oh uh, one of the writers.
I fall down an elevator shaft? What the hell does this mean, I fall down an elevator shaft?
Let me see that!
How young is young Ethan? Young?
Come on baby, come on!
Well! What happened?! Did we miss it?
Let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat.
Look, Ross look, I'm on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that's gonna get you in trouble.
Come on!!
Listen also we're uh, we're watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over.
Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!
Wheel!
Morning, Paul.
Well, the duck...
What's going on?
Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?
Ewwwww!
All right-oh! Listen, I know this is your party, but I'd really like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there.
Whoa, I didn't know we could date your sister!
Whoa-whoa-hey-hey! Hi, Paul is it?
I thought we talked about this. I don't like pulp. No pulp. Pulp isn't juice. All juice, okay?
They're here already?
Oh, it is.
Well, not that its any of your business, but, no, we havent, okay?
Miracle!
Look, Rachel, we don't have to do this.
Hey!
Yeah.
Any one of the brilliant actresses nominated for this award tonight deserves to take it home. Unfortunately only one can. The nominees for Best Supporting Actress are from Passions Erin Goff. From One Life to Live Mary Loren Bishop , from All My Children Sarah Mchann, and from Days of Our Lives Jessica Ashley. And the winner is......Jessica Ashley from Days of Our Lives. Uh, unfortunately Jessica couldn't be with us tonight so I'll be accepting this award on her behalf. And I'm sure that Jessica would like to thank my parents who always believed in me. She'd also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Ross, Phoebe, and Rachel who's sittin' right there!
I don't think so.
Damnit!
No you're not! Not to me!
Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not.
Okay.
Oh-oh!
That's what you told me.
Yeah, that was a tricky one. In reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours, but they only showed it for 2 minites.
That's weird!
Look, do you want the ring or not?!
Hey Ross listen Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend!
Y'know, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?
Fight's over!
Hey, y'know what a really good rainy day game is?
All right! Thanks Pheebs!
Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're dead! You're gone! You're worm food! ...So Chandler looks gay, huh?
Ooh, I was gonna say bologna, but that's much better. How about a little of that smoked turkey?
I told ya.
Hey, y'know Ross, I think I kinda understand why I kinda lost it today.
No, only for sex.
Oh, nothing, no. It's an acting exercise, I'm practising my fake laugh.
Hello Mr. Bing...I love you.
Well that's like summer in a bowl.
Listen, I ah, I know it's a longshot. But, by any chance did she find that funny?
Hey, are you cool with this. I mean, I don't want to leave you high and dry.
Which goes where?
How come you don't live with Mommy? How come Mommy lives with that other lady? What's a lesbian?
Sure. So how long you been...
We have a half hour.
Hello, Zelda.
Yeah!
Felicity and I, we're watching My Giant, and I was thinking, "I'm never gonna be as good an actor as that giant." Do you think I'm just wasting my life with this acting thing?
I don't! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australian dancer.
Hey man, what's up?
I'd really prefer a mountain bike.
Hey!
Did I get it?
Aww that's nice. Family should be there, huh? This is her wedding, happiest day of her life.
Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I'm gonna do that.
It made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. Look, there's no unselfish good deeds, sorry.
Hey-hey!
Erica.
Oh.
Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it.
Ooh, I look good.
And-and-and not only that, I'm gettin' a new brain!!
Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles.
Ah, the stalker.
Hey Pheebs! Listen, uh can you do me a favor? I forgot the pin number to my ATM card can, can you get it for me?
It'll kill him. I mean it'll, it'll just kill him.
What?
Thanks.
Mine!
There was a seen in Footloose...
What is this? Fruit?
Ok, ok, How about if we split it?
Uh, 10:30.
What?
They're takin all my stuff back. I guess you were right.
Dad, Ronni's here.
All right well, I'm outta here. Wish me luck.
Yeah!
Mom, so what did you think?
It's not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally--Owww!! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right? Well he just told me that he's not entirely happy.
Nope.
Yeah, I wouldn't know about that.
Where's Kate?
Are you drunk?
Oh, forget about it. She rocks!
Hey, you're back!
Thanks!
So I guess you all saw it.
Oh my God, you're back!
Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more.
Dah!!
I don't know Ross, not if you're gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist.
But you said one.
Oh, Urse...
Hey, Pheebs!
Oh, well we watch it a second time and its Die Hard 2!
And I was tired from digging the huge hole!
Yeah, me too.
Hey!
Look Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born, okay? Now, I have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks! What does that tell ya'?
What's it sound like? It's a guy with my identical hands! It was incredible! Chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like me! It-it was like looking at my hands in a mirror!
Yes!
Oh come-look, when I was a kid my dad's company gave season tickets to the number one salesman every year, all right? My dad never won! Of course, he wasn't in the sales division, but still, I never ever, ever forgot that!
I know!
Oh yeah, I added three.
Good, otherwise my watch would fall off.
Home sweet home, huh? Nice to, uh, get back to reality. Plus we know how the New Year's gonna go off. I guess there's no reason for all that Y2K panic, y'know? Anyway, g'night!
I call Godfather!
Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.
I just had a glass.
Fine!
Rachel, there you are! Come on, let's serve that dessert already!
But why?! I should've won one and I really want it and she didn't even care enough to come to the thing! It could also be a Grammy.
But you're still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today.
Well, he's not used to women being so forward with him; but uh, I good check with him-He says it's okay. Great! Thanks! Bye-bye!
Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk.
Yeah? I just figured y'know, after living with you it'd be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, y'know? Someone I can learn from, someone-someone who's different than me. And what's more different than me; a guy who's not 19 than say a girl who is 19? Enh? Not just a hat rack my friend!
All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game.
So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero.
Yeah, right.
C'mon, she's your mom!
What's wrong with the twentieth?
Oh well, they're killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body.
Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for... Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.
Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates.
Hey-hey-hey!
So are guys doing okay?
Oh... Can you imagine if I hadn't left you that last one? You two might've never gotten together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sent that hooker up to the room like I was gonna?! It's like it was in the stars!
You can't go out there.
Funny one! That's good!
All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I'm gonna go see my agent.
Sure! I would love to wait with you guys! Thanks!
Dude! What are yo-you trying to kill me?!
Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?
Don't do it!
Yeah?
All right, who got Chandler? 'Cause I uh, need to trade.
Hey! So I'm back.
Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!
Whoa, dude, look out! You almost crushed my hat!
Just a, uh... hearing disability.
Will you quit hoggin' it!
Well, I think we all learned something.
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...
What?
That's crazy.
Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?!
Road trip! Yeah, we can rent a car! I just have to be there by Tuesday!
Are you ok, Ross?
Hey, Monica, the knob was broken so I just turned it off from underneath, I hope that's alright.
Yeah, but uh, I don't want to be up too late, so uh, I'll have a decaf.
So what are we gonna do?! We have no reinforcements! No-no food!
Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something. Uh, I was just over there talking to Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight.
Oh yeah, who's playing?
No, look.
Hey, you know our phone's not working?
Why would you need to say hi to them, you've been feeding them for four days?
Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there!
Hey Pheebs, I'm so sorry.
Well it hit me anyway! And it would've hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer.
Yeah?
What happened?
Shhhh!
Yeah! You did! And that's why I'm leaving.
Yeah!
Oooh.
Luck!
You ah, you forgot your shoes.
I know.
Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?
You do?
Noooo. No-no-no, these babies sell themselves.
Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Hey Annabelle.
Some girl ate Monica.
You serious?
Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise.
Who's Paul?
Hey, I've done plays before. I'm a serious actor.
What are you talkin' about? I never left you! You've always been my agent!
Oh, I'm sorry, Ross. I'll get it for you right now. And since I made you wait, I'll toss in a free muffin.
Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!
I wanna gooooooo!
See, this is why I don't date women who read. Uh-oh.
Hey! You ready to go?
Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.
Oh, yeah, he rode the bus today.
Hey-hey listen...
What?
Who wants French toast?
I was tryin' to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I'm gonna do?
Yeah?!
That's great, but isn't it gonna bother that people still think you're a porn star?
Hey!
This sucks, I was just up by that much!
I will not take this abuse.
Hey guys!
What?!
It is???
Look, maybe I need to try a real teacher! Right here! Here! Andy Cooper, he teaches guitar and look ooh, there's a nice picture of him with a little kid and THE KID'S GOT A GUITAR!!!!!!
Get out of the corner. Pass it, pass it.
Yeah, whatever.
You wanna see her again, right?
It's almost as if he knew.
Consider it done.
I know! I know! Come on, please-please you guys, don't-don't be mad. I'm sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends! Y'know? And it was our first date! Plus, she's really sick!
Just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth?
Okay, I'm all right, okay, but hey, could you just leave your lips?
Oh man! They-they just redid my make-up!
Hi!
I did that too! They wouldn't give me her real name or her number. They said, "If I bothered them again they'd call the police." I said, "If you talk to the police, you tell them I'm missing a ring!"
Hey.
The bigger half.
But it hurt's my Joey's Apple.
No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. Hey, Angela.
Oh come on. Nobody likes two different kinds of eggs equally. You like one better than the other and I wanna know which.
Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.
Maybe you'll order a little sangria?
Aw! Look at that, every inch of this stuff is glued down. It'd take forever to pry this up. You should ah, you should just leave it.
Yeah, there's this guy from Chicago who's supposed to be the next Martin Scorcese, all right? But then this guy's right after him. Hello!
Hey, here she comes.
I can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'.
They're ribbed for your pleasure.
Sure.
Dude, you should've gone out once and a while.
Oh, I'm sorry. You wanna bite?
Yes!!! Ha-ha-ha!
G-sharp.
Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist too!
Hey!
Aww, me too. Now let's finish this and go to bed.
Yeah may-maybe you don't tell anyone about this.
Hey, you guys!
So you're gonna have to do it in the mess!
Oh, I've been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche.
Yeah!
This is amazing.
All right, it won't go down any further. It's stuck.
You got all that from the back of her head?
What a tool!
I'm gonna do it.
Marcel?
Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can't figure it out! I talk to you and nothin'. You look at me, and it's nothin'. Nothing.
Hey, listen you ah....
Hey, how you doin'?
Okay. I went down to the 'Mattress King' showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband.
Yeah!
Wh-wh-what's going on? Wh-what's this about L.A.?
Marcel?
Hey I-
Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.
...look both ways before you cross the street.
Wow, that was kinda brutal.
How's that pig-in-the-blanket workin' out for you? I wrapped those bad boys.
A little salami.
Huh?
Cookie, now you can punch him!
Well I didn't tell them!
Boy I tell ya, this little talent came in handy before I could afford porn.
Why don't you like PBS, Pheebs?
Dude-dude, who would you rather have kiss your sister, me or Chandler?
I'm telling ya, you guys are totally getting back together!
Are you kidding? I love that guy! Morning's here! Morning is here-
What is the big deal?
Yeah! All right? Let's go!
Put it on.
Both of us?
Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, "Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg."
Hey! You guys! You're not gonna believe this! I just got off the phone with my agent...
Really?
Okay look, Chandler, if this you have got to listen! You're gonna throw that juice at me, aren't ya?
Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, that's why I let people watch.
Your folks are really that bad, huh?
No I didn't.
No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.
It's the big night! We wanted to wish you good luck!
Fine! Now, where'd we land on those pancakes?
You knew about that?
I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not.
Uh, well, kinda yeah. Like, remember last week when Alex was in the accident? Well the line in the script was, 'If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to die.' But I made it, ' If this woman doesn't get to a hospital, she's not gonna live.'
Yeah, my uncle Sal has a really big tongue.
Okay. Okay, okay, hey. There we go, let's get your feet up there. Good night, Kate. Sweet dreams. I'm gonna put this can right here in case you have to hurl.
Hi!
Mornin'. I said, mornin'.
Are you bachelors?
Okay, hey, museum geeks, party's over. Okay. Wave bye-bye to the nice lady. There you go. Back to your parent's basement. All right. Come on boys, come on out! Here you go. All right.
Okay. Can I squeeze your ass?
No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don't know why you're pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there's a spot open.
Come on!
Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too.
Hey Ross, I'm aware of what I owe.
All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty.
Yeah.
You want his yearbook?
You know more than one Fun Bobby?
Bye-bye.
Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!
All right, I'll take a box of the cream filled Jesus's.
Okay. Hey uh, when do I get to meet the robot?
So the Porsche guy took his car back.
Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did.
Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!
Do we have to know about that?
You're kidding right?
IN LONDON!!!
Hey, is, is, is Chandler here?
Hey!
Kristen?
Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!
Eh! There you go.
Well, maybe that's because you're closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.
Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!
I'm not listening to you!
I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?
Maybe he, uhh... drives his car on the other side of the road, if ya know what I mean.
Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier!
When? Today? Some, not a lot.
Well, the part's mine if I want it.
Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there . Soo...
I'm listening.
Oh great! Y'know I would've been perfect for this part, but whatever! Y'know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day!
Phoebe's a porn star!
Wha-
There's just so much pressure. I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different. I don't know if you'd understand.
Yeah I guess you're right.
Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks!
You're right! That did cheer me up!
Hey, how come, uhh, Chandler didn't come?
Hey, Felicity.
No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents always lie. You know, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went another way', but this, I can use this. I canna work on a new accent.
Hey!
We didn't ruin it!
Really?
You're in!
No, it's just my luggage.
Hey! Don't you hang up on me! I'll marry you and me right now! I have the power!
A little foos?
You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there's this one other audition that I really, really want, and Estelle couldn't get me in.
I can't believe I'm hearing this!
No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.
Nothing, I'm just practicing blowing you off because I'm gonna be a big movie star!
What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!
Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over, gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!
I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!
Wow! This girl is good.
Aww, I don't want to see that!
Great. Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the spoons.
Uhh, Pheebs, those are uh, those are Santa pants.
Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.
Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?
See, I actually can pour milk, but I got you believing that I couldn't. Now, see, that's acting.
Hello New York!
Eight hundred and twelve bucks.
Oh, here's where I win all my money back!
I went.
"Heckles, you crack me up in science class. You're the funniest kid in school.
Yes! There's still pie.
Awwww!
What?
Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know...
Nooo, later.
Look Mon, if you could just call my mom...
Oh! Wait-wait! Is it my bologna sandwich?
I'm back baby! Ha-ha-ha!
Whoa. Wait a minute, wait a minute.
