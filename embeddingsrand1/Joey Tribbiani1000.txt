Wait, here's one. Uh, would you be willing to cook naked?
..ah, what're you doing here? I've been trying to call you.
Okay, it's a typical New York City apartment. Two girls are just hanging out.
Problem solved.
Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots.
Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too.
Okay. All right. Umm, so uh, so how did it happen? Did your eyes meet across the room? And then the next thing y'know you're in the bathtub together and she's feeding you strawberries?
Hey, I'm back!
Sounds great! Okay all right, well where does this go?
Yeah we are!
Or not. Uh, Rach, why don't you just move in with me?
Yeah, or-or to get a hooker.
Right, they uh, they choppered me in. What's up?
Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?
Oh, man, I could totally get that part. 'I'm sorry, that seat is taken.'
Yeah, I got my speech!
Yeah-yeah, absolutely.
I didn't get it?
You talked to him. Are you crazy?
Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.
Well, now we got a reason.
I think I know that girl.
Nah.
You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!
Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?
Oh yeah? And who do you like?
Ooh, I look good.
Ooh, very official.
All right, huddle up, right over here.
Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.
Heard about the leg burnin' huh?
Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!
Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.
Hey, the fight's starting!
I'm listening.
What's not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Gooooood.
Hey!
But you can't stay with Phoebe, Ross! We're-we're roomies!
You pushed him!
What-what is it, what is it?
Wait up!
Hey. I spent the night out. I met this cute bridesmaid. She is so...
She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it.
Great. Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the spoons.
Hey! Wanna play some foosball? Please?
Huh? So whaddya think? Casa de Joey. Huh? I decorated it myself.
Well, I sorta am. I mean yeah, I'm dating this girl who's also seeing another guy. But, I don't know, I'm not to worried about it.
Fine! Now, where'd we land on those pancakes?
Listen, you know how uh, when you're wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?
There's a lost and found? My shoe!
I guess.
Can we please turn this off?
But I made cards!!
It really hit me last night. I'm gonna be on Days of our Lives. And then I started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives..
All right look man, I didn't want to bring this up, but Chandler, is the stupidest name I ever heard in my life! It's not even a name; it's barely even a word. Okay? It's kinda like chandelier, but it's not! All right? It's a stupid, stupid non-name!
Really? I don't...
I will not take this abuse.
Fortune! This guy is so stupid. It's Count Rushmore!!
Yeah.
Yeah baby!
I didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok.
Well then maybe I will.
You're a dork.
Okay. All right. You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking, that you're not breaking up with her. No blinking.
Umm...
Yeah-yeah, I'm one of the cops that won't work with you 'cause you a lose cannon. Anyway, look, I'm really sorry, but I stink!
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!
Hi.
Yeah, but what if he doesn't? He's such a good duck.
Okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat.
Uhh do you happen to have a hot girl in there?
Whoa!
Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate.
That is incredible! You are the master!
So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?
How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might.
Nothing, I'm just practicing blowing you off because I'm gonna be a big movie star!
Yeah I did!
You're not stupid. You're meaner than I thought.
I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?
Cool, thanks.
Yeah-yeah-yeah, and they had that beer! That uh...
No! Year! Happy No Year!
All right, that's it! He cannot do this to Phoebe. This guy is going to get the butt kicking of a lifetime! But, is he a big guy?
That's weird!
Huh.
Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her.
Whoa, I'm not done.
Okay.
So that's why I feed my dog Purina One! Pick up a bag today!
Now? You want me to go over there now?
They gave me the shaft all right.
You wanna see what I got? Okay? I've got a baby Tootsie Roll, a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex, a rock, and an army man. Hey!
Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear.
Nooo.
What?
Hey guys! I was at the library all morning and I already finished my five pages for today!
Don't blame me, I saw it on The Discovery Channel.
... It's a fertility study.
Spock's birth control.
Yeah, you're great! Okay, let's take it from...
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot, or just fall down. That's good too.
Hey!
How little are they? I mean, are they like scary little?
He-he-he, how's it goin'?
Yeah, y'know at first I thought we could talk about this y'know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don't think I...
Just okay-Did you do it right?!
Hey!
The Mr. Bowmont's here!!!
No.
Well, he's gonna. I'll see you a little later, ok? Hey, how ya doin'?
Ross, don't let her drink anymore!
Yeah. I understand. I understand. Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first!
Yep. Ice Capades.
What?!! No I'm not!!
Hi!
No I just uh, thought you liked your eggs with the bread with the hole in the middle, a-la me.
Saw a girl with that vest.
Awwww!
Nooooo.
Yeah well, maybe you should go back! Okay? Rachel moves in, and before you know it you're right where you don't want to be! Back together!
Hey-hey!
Well you-you-you-you might say congratulations! I saw the board! I went to the audition! I got the part!!
Hey, now you're the one who wet his pants.
Aww, man, he took the five of spades!! Oh, no-no-no, here it is!
Oh yeah, sure, no problem, I'll just-hold on one second. "Hey Timmy, I've got a surprise for you!"
Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine. Yeah. Yeah! It's not that I'm a bad actor...
And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and, and, and bite her!
The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin' Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn't even get half a cup! Nothin'!!
Get out! I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me.
Erica.
I know! All right, I'll see you guys over there! I'm off to fight the Nazis.
What do you need?
Feminine.
But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right?
Hey!
Well, hey I did learn.
Yeah! Well, I think we'll see if they actually let you play. Huh? I mean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like, "You look 19," and then they just take it away like-like, "No you don't."
Yeah right.
Hey! Any good mail?
See? Eh, wasn't that fun?
Oh my God.
No! No! I am not a sex addict!
Ross, hey, the band's ready outside for your first dance with Emily, so...
I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out. So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log.
Yeah. And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous rock formation.
Okay.
Alright, look, I'll start, OK?
Okay, Okay, Fine! Make Jokes, I Don'T Care! This Is A Big Break For Me!
Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot.
No we weren't!
That's not gonna work out! Then she's gonna come home all weepy and you'll be tellin' her, "Oh that's okay. You'll find someone." And then, bamn! She finds you!
Woah, woah, woah, you have a date?
So I guess it's Joey then!
Bye, Pheebs!
Hey, there's a dog out there!
Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!
Definitely!
Oh hey, no, you're not welcome. Okay, look, I hate this! You guys keep embarrassing me! Yesterday, Rachel found your razor in our bathroom and I didn't know what to say, so I said it was mine and-and that I was playing a woman in a play. And one thing led to another and
So did that do anything for ya?
I know! I mean it's not like we weren't cool about it.
That's my line! I can take it from here, thanks. Dearly beloved, I'm sorry I'm a little late. You may be confused by this now, but you won't be Memorial Day weekend 2002. Well, let's get started before the groom takes off again. Huh? We are gathered here today, to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. I've known Monica and Chandler for a long time, and I can not imagine two people more perfect for each other. And now, as I've left my notes in my dressing room. We shall proceed to the vows. Monica?
Unless what?
Get him a bone, get a bone. You gotta bone?
You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.
Yeah, that's the uh, game we were playing.
Wouldn't you pay good money to see these identical hands showcased in some type of a uh, entertainment venue?
They actually said that?
Oh, here's where I win all my money back!
What's twisted?
Whoa-whoa, what is it?
Okay! Okay, look! You-you-you got Harrison Ford up there!
Phoebe?
All right! Hey, who wants pizza?!
Well, then it wouldn't be a secret. So yeah, that would be okay. Yeah. Yeah!
What do you mean?
Oh-whoa-wait, Gunther don't-don't forget your shirt.
Ahh, forget about it, I'm havin' a ball. How's the apartment doin'
Oh my God!
Is something wrong?
Foxy lady.
Nana?
No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
Okay.
Oh that's mine too! I'm Italian!
Sorry, that was wax.
No, but he's...
Alright, I can make my peace with the clean dry towels...Also what is with these chips you bought?
Well anyway, the guy they wanted backed out and now they want me! I start shooting today!
Fine! Do you take Vasa or Mustercard?
Whoa! For a rich guy he's got, that's a pretty small TV.
Okay.
Really?
What the heck is that?
What about me?! You-you just said I could!
Hey.
That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously? Okay.
Good, me too. Eggs and milk are in the fridge. Thanks.
What? What the hell am I doing? You just broke my fridge!
No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?
Yeah, I-I just made up the stuff about the wedding because I didn't want you to worry about me. But, I'm having surgery today.
He forgot to leave his grip size!
Great, well, I'm happy for ya. Alright that's it. He just comes in here, Mr. Jonny Neweggs, with his, his, his movin' the mail and his, his 'see ya pals'. And now there's no juice. There's no juice f or the people who need the juice and want the juice. I need the juice.
Oh, oh, oh, sorry.
Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate this Pheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle.
So what are we gonna do?! We have no reinforcements! No-no food!
No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.
Come on Treeger, don't say that. You just ahh, you just need more practice. Here, come on, let's ahh, let's try it again. Come on. Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway. I mean, y'know, I'm not really that comfortable dancing with a- We-he!! Hey!
Hey.
Have you been here all night?
I am telling you Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again! Now, is that what you want?
Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her! And her roommate!
So that if we went out on a date, shed be there.
Pheebs! There you are! Okay, you broke my fridge; you owe me 400 bucks!
Take the bra off.
Oh.
Yeah?
No, no, you can't, you can't, okay, you can't, you can't buy her pearls, you just can't, you can't, you can't.
I know! They suck!!
And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
Hey!
I bet I stopped listening before you did.
Yeah, what's that about?
I fell down an elevator shaft.
Serious?
Yeah.
No-no.
I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those...
What else?
Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends, she only talks to agents.
I'm comin' out!
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah! Enh? All right, what do you think?
You guys okay?
No! Because he didn't believe in my movie! Which is a big mistake because it is real! Real!
So...What?
Why not?
I may have to, I hate to do it, but I'm the star! Y'know? There's a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor. Excuse me. Joey Tribbiani.
Eh, what are you gonna do?
Because Vincent, we were lovers. For two years!
Oh my god.
Hey-hey-hey!
Okay. Did ah, you guys mean you plus one?
Uhh, Pheebs, those are uh, those are Santa pants.
But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.
Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy.
They want me to be totally naked in the movie!
Yeah, yeah. Hey, why don't you give a pull on that rope?
No, I really have to pee.
How's she doing?
And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be like, 'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'
Yeah, you're roommate is a soap opera star.
All right!
Let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat.
Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for... Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.
I'm Joey Tribbiani.
Yeah, I guess it is. Listen, I ah, I gotta say good bye, and-and I gotta say it quick 'cause this is killing me. One thing you gotta know, is that I will never forget you. But, you've got things you have to do now, and so do I. And so... I'm gonna get on this spaceship, and I'm gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, you'll be long gone. But I won't have aged at all. So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne, baby, I'm gonna want to meet her.
Yeah.
They do!
I don't know! How about, "Thanks for taking the message." Jeez!
Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back.
Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not. Eh? All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket. I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs.
Call it even?
Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry.
No plans, huh?
Yeah
I don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought that's what it was. Let me see it again.
Movies?
No you don't, I just saw you go in there with Monica!
Like this. Pictures of cute babies we don't know. We..we can't have that.
She's right in there.
Dude, I screwed up, you don't have to turn me in!
Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!
Over there! Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said "No," you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!
Whoa!! Now look, don't be just blurtin' stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?
I don't know! But he did not eat your face cream!
Yeah, there's this guy from Chicago who's supposed to be the next Martin Scorcese, all right? But then this guy's right after him. Hello!
Ross, did you really read all these baby books?
No! All right, who-who makes up the questions?
Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch.
I bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a VCR in our hotel room... we'd never even have to go outside!
How come those?
Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies.
Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's! What? Thought we were trying to find stuff.
What?!
Well, thank you. So, can we play 20 Questions now? I've got a really good one! I've been thinking about it since Kansas.
I got you something! Open it! Open it!
Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.
Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.
You wanna see her again, right?
Ooh!
Yeah?! So's yours!
Well all right then, I guess I shouldn't get to excited about the fact that I just kissed her!
I'm sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.
No-no, thank you.
Y'know, there's two women dude.
Oh my God, is she going back to him?
Phoebs, he's just a little dog. Ahhh.
What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you?
Yeah!
Yeah, there's this superintendent's dance, the Super Ball. I don't know, and he wants to impress Marge, this lady super that he's a crush on.
So anyway, I'm trying to get my boss's ex-wife to sleep with me. . .
Who wants French toast?
Look, I told ya, I'm not going to any clinic! I don't have a problem, you're the one with the problem! You should go to a "Quit being a baby and leave me alone" clinic!
No.
I'm having surgery!
Hey Estelle, listen...
Hey, how much cash do you got in your pocket right now?
Well you gotta kiss someone, you can't kiss your sister.
Whoa, dude, look out! You almost crushed my hat!
Exactly.
Uhh, cause, uhh, I'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal chokage. Alright, look, I got to tell you something.
Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there! That was my agent. My agent has just gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie!
Hi.
...feel like getting a cup of coffee?
Ah, now Rach, these ah, these little women.
Hello?
Kinda looks like that stuff you get when you get a bad infection.
Nice!! Yeah! Is that part of your resolution, your new thing for today?
All right!
Hey.
That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!
Where's all the tissues?!
Ohh, then no. Maybe I should hear those specials again.
Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.
I'm out.
All right, I have one question. What is the deal with this?
Good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it'll absorb some of the moisture and then you can get your pants back up.
Okay, shoot.
Yes.
Nope.
All right. I can't see.
Well, it looks like it wasn't heeled after all! Yeah! So, I guess this chair is mine now!
Oh no, can't invite her. She also steals.
Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?
Who cares? You're Rachel! Who's Kip?
Oh, you should here me.
Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know.
Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!
Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.
Hey Pheebs!
Oh.
Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?
You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this, I owe you one. Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?
Wow! You guys seem to be having a good time.
Yep.
Hi, here's the deal. We lost a carseat on a bus today. It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller. Oh, and there was a baby in it. He wants to talk to you again.
Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk.
Oooh.
Hey!
Phoebs look, if you want to know what the deal is, you're just gonna have to ask him.
Ah, I'm-I'm walking down the aisle...Still walking. I'm about to pass the bridesmaid I hooked up with last night. Hey! I told her "Hey." And now I'm at the front with Ross. It's Phoebe. He looks pretty mad. Uh...I'd better go.
Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday?
Pheebs! Wait up! Listen uh, close your eyes. Maybe that's one thing you can cross off your list.
I guessed 20,000!
Whoa, store will be open tomorrow!
I don't know! Yeah, I do.
Whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra, therefore has the biggest wire.
And what did he say?
I know.
Uh, I get Leslie out of the coma and then we make out.
The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up! But I figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they're gonna start to think that I don't own it. So I figured I'll wash it. Right? Monica, you got a bucket and some soap I can borrow?
She's mad because I know today's her laundry day and that means she's wearing her old lady underpants.
He-he-eyy.
Uh yeah, right here.
And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
I know. It was so cool when I was up there before. Me and Jim Belushi would just be crackin' up about something... Then I get fired off of Days Of Our Lives and he takes me down. Now he's just laughing at me. Look at him, that smug Belushi bastard, I'll...
Karen.
Ahhh! My ah, my agent said it wasn't a dancing part.
Ahh Pheebs, you know you're still my number one girl.
You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!
Angela? Joey Tribiani. Listen, what are ya doing tonight. I know your seeing that guy I was thinking maybe you could bring him.....Hello? Hello?
Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go?
Yes! Yes, I did.
Thanks for stopping by. See ya! I-I am so sorry. I...
Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place.
Ohhhh, good one! And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country.
You can't do anything!
Hi, Lauren.
Oh, yeah, he rode the bus today.
I'm not finished.
You want his yearbook?
I can give it a shot.
Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant.
Yeah you see umm, well, I'm an actor. Right? So I gotta keep my emotions right at the surface y'know? See what I'm saying? I gotta lot of balls in the air. Y'know what I mean? It's tough! Guys like me, y'know, you wander around, you're alone...
Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you'd be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!
Yeah, not it here it isn't.
Relax. Here hold this . This old stuff just comes right off.
You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel.
Well, I was Dr. Drake Remoray, Stryker's twin brother. I mean, who looks more me than me right?
Noooo. No-no-no, these babies sell themselves.
Hmm.
Hey!
Me too.
Well actually...
No. Why?
Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!
Yeah! I'm fine! Thanks! Hey Rach, how you doin'?
Ooh! So close.
Oh, I got it! How about saying something like, "Monica...
Ascot!
Later!
Uhh, just a minute officer!!
I don't know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell 'em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.
Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it.
Whoa-ho-ho! Yeah, okay.
So you like the nachos uh? Myself I'm partial to...
Pheebs! You're blocking the porn! Look out!
Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross?
Oh! Tell her she's not marriage material.
Alright, well, I'm gonna order a pizza.
That sketch you mentioned? Might it have looked a little something like this?
No-no, things ah, finally happened with Kate.
Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.
Fine. Gang up on me! I got you all right where I want you.
That's right, all the ladies want to stay at Joey's.
So, you were both dorks. Big deal.
Hey you guys.
What?
All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. And they're off!
Look Mon, if you could just call my mom...
Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States.
Well, he's too shy, he doesn't thing he's good enough to dance with girls yet.
No-no! I used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff, remember? Let's see uh, well I don't want to donate sperm again. I really prefer doing that at the home office y'know? Ooh-ooh, maybe they want like some of my blood or-or spit or something, huh?
Great story! But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea... Oh man,
Yes!
Yeah, it's this great part, this boxer named Nick. And I'm so, so right for it, y'know, he's just like me. Except he's a boxer, and has an evil twin.
Hey, you know our phone's not working?
Well, you know Chandler.
Well, let me see.
Eggs. Who's eggs do you like better, his or mine, huh?
I do. There's uh, let's see, Guy With a Mustache, Smokes-A-Lot Lady, Some Kids I've Seen, and A Red-haired Guy Who Does Not Like To Be Called Rusty.
Yeah, I uh weighted like 27 pounds when I was born so...
Ew! What is that? Something exploded!
You got to go on a ride along?!
Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?
I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.
"I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke."
Thanks!
I'll treat you real nice.
Over the line?! You-you're-you're so far past the line, that you-you can't even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
Yeah!! I call that London style.
Yeah!
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I get 'ya?
What was it?
You do have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are you, are you crazy?!
The Red Ross! Okay.
I can't tell you that, no.
Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?
Me too! Yeah. And comfortable. Do uh, do you like leather seats?
No. No. No.
Oh, that's OK. You uh, you had a thing.
Yeah, but I don't wanna die!
And I know both of them, they're really good. One of them is the guy from those allergy commercials who's always getting chased by those big flowers...
Ahh!
Sorry, sorry.
Wow! I can't believe this! This is incredible. I mean you just won an Oscar!
What?
Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook.
Noo!! I've had the best day ever! Dude, check this out! Now, I'm gonna fastforward past the part with you, 'cause it is boring.
You gave him cookies?
Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?
That's Fergie baby!!
Look, I don't know why the kids need a youth center anyway! Y'know? They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine!
Oh that's on the house courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.
Hey, Julie, I didn't know you wore lenses.
Hey-hey-hey you made it!
Oh, very funny. I don't know if you remember, but my audition was supposed to be Thursday. You got me the audition?! Let's hug it up!
So what're you guys gonna eat?
Hey, it's gonna be all right.
Pheebs, you gotta stop this, I working on commission here.
Okay. Have a benefit.
Oh. Well good! For me. What is this? Did you give yourself a facial?
Uh-huh, not as high as... It worked! King!
What?
'Tonight' tonight?
Nope.
Takes it out of you?
Look, what am I gonna do? I'm not flirting but still, I'm drawing her to me like - like a moth to a flame! What the hell's going on over here?!?!? Monica's gonna kill you! Look I need your help, I have to do something to-to repel this woman! Wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all the time.
We'll be there.
No way! 'Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it's gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
Wow!
Can I ask you something?
Hey.
So are guys doing okay?
Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio. Hey Monica listen is-is Phoebe there? I gotta ask her something about the car.
Ewww! Ugly Naked Guy is using his new hammock. It's like a Play-Doo Fat Factory.
Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!
You're gonna have to pee on it.
Ross, you're mayor of the zone.
Fine! Get out!
Come on man, you know I'd do it for you! Because, you're my best friend.
Monica. Oh... huh, I always thought it would be Rachel.
All right, who got Chandler? 'Cause I uh, need to trade.
All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay? You're hot. I'm lovable. Clearly there's a vibe going on between us. But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.
Maybe he found you flip-flop.
All right, I'm going. I'm going.
It looks like a women's purse.
Yeah. I'll uh, I'll call ya.
Seriously?
It's almost as if he knew.
I don't know.
Uh-uh nothing. I-I-I-I didn't want you to touch me cause I'm -I'm all sweaty from the workout. I better hit the shower. Oh my God!
I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.
Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right?
Come on look guys, don't fight.
Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?
All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's great, but...
You know, uh... Chandler got you a gift, too.
Woah. Why do you get to keep the table?
But hey, Ross, this place is available now!
Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I like that!
Sorry. Wrong boobies.
If you wanna get back in the car, we need the wire, your call.
Yeah, she's been in there all day , uh high fever, a nose problem... Phlegm! Phlegm! Phlegm-phlegm-phlegm!
Uh, we might be leaving now.
Pretty cool, huh? But if you're thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn't get sucked up into the mechanism, well you'd be wrong.
...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt.
C'mon show us what you bought. . . You know you want to.
All right, hold on! Hold on. Hold on. This is Ross, okay? He's our friend. He obviously went crazy. He obviously lost his mind.
Good. Hey.
Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it!
What's wrong buddy?
Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?
Whoa.
No, no, no, don't say "listen." I know that "listen." I've said that "listen."
Hey, how was your chef thing?
Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?
Oh hi!
Uhhhh.... I'll just pee in the street.
Where are you gettin' this?
Yeah, hi. You guys got any of those baby chicks? 'Cause I was watching this ah, commercial on TV and man, those guys are cute!
Frankie? What're you talking about?
Yeah!
You're in!
Okay. I went down to the 'Mattress King' showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband.
Okay, now the Mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic period.
Fine! Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?!
Nope.
Did you see the size of the closets?!
Can I tell you something? Me too.
Ok, ok, How about if we split it?
Closeness-shmoshness! There was three of us for crying out loud!
Here she comes. Hold on, I'm gonna make your life much easier.
Joey's your best friEnd. You want to make him a cheese sandwich everyday. And you also want to buy him hundreds of dollars worth of pants.
Well maybe I love ya'.
Hey no problem.
Dan just moved in downstairs. Yeah, he just got back from like this four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella.
They did it right there on the couch.
How is this your seat?
So what are you doing bringing her here?! There's people here!
Yes! Shame about you man.
So what if he didn't come! We can still go out and party ourselves!
Wow! This girl is good.
Huh?!
Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.
Yeah right!
Yeah, sure. Well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography.
I can hear you!
Days Of Our Lives. Anyway, you're not gonna believe it! My character is coming out of his coma!!
I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y'know, you think I'll ever get there?
Chandler?
But only in the moment. So do ya wanna kiss again?
Take it back?
I want the drugs Ross, I want the drugs!
Go get 'em Treeger.
So, you just left? Her place was really that bad?
Look I don't know this baby. I don't know if she's a famous artist or not. You know, and I don't want to be a jerk but you're changing too much around here.
Name one!
Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't you guys?
Yeah?
Good enough to get fired.
Hi.
Yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that I finished it. And uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it. So would you guys read it for me?
Like-like what?
Ugh. Now if a cow should die of natural causes, I can have one of those right?
All right, give it back to me. 5 of hearts.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Oh wow, what a beautiful name! What is it again?
Look, what do you want me to say?
Ohhh.
What?
One of the virus victims called in sick, so Cathy recommended me and boom, I'm dying on the gurney. Oh Ross, Marcel just finished his last scene if you want to go down there and say goodbye.
Here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.
The country?
Whoa! Yeah, what the hell is that? What smells so bad?
I can't believe you're not picking me.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's okay. I know what a mainsail is. I know, I know to duck when the boom comes across. I-I know port is right.
Oh, y'know what? Since I'm here, I think I'm gonna have me a little beer on the port side.
Wow, it's really long.
Oh man!
That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, "whoa."
You wanna make it 6?!
I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
That's what you told me.
Yeah, you can get a Volvo. If that's what you really want.
We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man.
Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago.
Which, is the new plan!
Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?
Mma, Mma, Mmaah
All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.
What?
Ohhh, here it comes.
Who knows?
I was tryin' to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I'm gonna do?
Well, what's it called?
I like that! Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em!
What?! He got me! Owwwwww!!!
Hold it hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple. It made me nuts.
Oh umm, not go.
I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you.
Good morning.
Hey-hey! Stanley! Hey-hey! You're leading man is here! Let's get to work.
Hey-hey listen...
Thanks! Yeah, there's pulp in that.
Awful! Horrible!
Dude, they're not objects.
Ross, you don't have to yell.
So what? Look, suppose we were a divorced couple.
All right, I should get going, big day a work. Y'know I'm in a coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out I'm not brain dead.
I meant female nudity. Alright? I don't need to see Lou Grant frolicking.
Okay, pick a card, any card. All right, now memorize it. Show to everybody. Got it?
Hey!
Wow! This looks great!
Okay, you watch too much TV.

No, no, I didn't mean you. But, you believed me, huh?
Yeah! Okay! Hey! Hi!
Oh, okay. The what?
Hey!
I got fired.
Me neither, y'know what-
No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! I'm serious this time! In-in fact, look, there's a-I wanna give you something. And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money. Now, I want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, y'know, thank you for being such a great roommate.
Oh hey, do you still have their final exams?
Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU. Hey, Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?
Okay.
Thanks.
So uh listen, I think I'm gonna take off now.
Maybe she killed him?
So, what did you guys think?
Okay, look I'm sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldn't have, but you got porn!
You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?
That's so sweet. I'm gonna get some coffee.
Oh sorry, I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross. Who-who's Barry and Mindy?
All right.
Hey!!
Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure our personalities match. Okay, so I made up a little test. Now, I'm gonna say a word and then you say the first thing that comes to mind.
Good for you!
I'll see you at 8:00.
Hey, how much did you guys tip the super this year?
Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!
Oh my God, you're back!
Great nap.
Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?
Hello? Oh hey! Can you, can you hang on a second? It's the producers over at Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. can you excuse me for a minute? Hey, funny you should call. I was just looking over next week's script. Canceled?! Like they're taking it off the air? Ohh. All right, see you Monday. We're not even shootin' them anymore?!! All right, bye! They canceled Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E!
Look, it was a job all right?
The Unbearable Likeness of Being!
Here. Now I only owe you $49.50.
You are dogged man! I totally fit!
Well, don't get your hopes up, because probably not gonna happen.
The hell with hockey, let's all do that!
What? Mine aren't tinted.
We love you, man.
Street noise drowned any of that out? No, all right, I see you later, okay...
No, I'm not questioning it, I'm saying it's stupid! What?!
Lookin' good Mr. Cotter.
But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I don't know anything about technology! I can't even use Chandler's computer except to find porn! And-and that's only 'cause it's right there when you turn it on!
And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv-
Hey!
Oooh, what you got there?
Yeah, maybe he just cheated on you.
Way to be strong, man!
Naa, you're just sayin' that 'cause you're in love with Yasmine Blepe.
What's the matter with you?!
It's not my first time.
Hey Phoeb's, I think you're good to go.
Here you go!
Hey-hey, I'm not judging.
Uh, yeah but uh, I may have said those things before but, I never truly meant them. Until now.
Yeah.
The part I want to audition for is a fireman, this is so meant to be!
I figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat!
Okay, so what are we going to do about this hand twin thing?!
Excuse me, Aaron? Hi! Umm, I have a little problem with the schedules. Originally, I wasn't supposed to work today, and I have this wedding that I really have to be at. It's my best friend's, and I'm officiating so I really can't work past four.
I can't believe it's Christmas already. Ya know, I mean, one day your eatin' turkey, the next thing ya know, your lords are a-leapin' and you geese are a-layin'.
Chandler's wearing panties.
Oh dear God!
Hello.
Okay. Okay.
Sure! I would love to wait with you guys! Thanks!
I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday.
Oh my God! I cannot believe you guys are talking about this! The problems in the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! All right?!! Now Chandler is doing the best he can!!
Really?!
Get out your checkbook, mister.
Good.
Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, "Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg."
I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal.
Not anymore. So anyway, how do you want to pay me?
You know it's funny you should mention that 'cause I was thinkin'... what's with the boxes?
And-and-and-and-and the toothpicks?
Well, I didn't realize until I got home. I wasn't gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! Y'know what? I'm gonna go find that guy's car and leave a note on the windshield.
Oh, yeah.
Hey!
Hair transplant.
Sh-shh-shh!
Hey guys!
So what? I drove down, sold T-shirts, had a blast. And y'know who knows how to party? Drunk college chicks.
'Kay!
Yeah, but uh, I don't want to be up too late, so uh, I'll have a decaf.
Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?
Hi!
Come on!
Okay. Can I squeeze your ass?
Hey! You guys! Check it out, check it out! Guess which job I got.
Erin.
Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.
Yeah, my agent just called me with an audition for Days of Our Lives!
My god, Angela.
Hey, I don't need violence to enjoy a movie. Just so long as there's a little nudity.
Open the box!!
Well to tell you the truth, they uh, they had a problem with the bag!
Careful! You're wasting good pastrami! Oh my God! I'm my dad!
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Or, or I'm the one who dates her.
No you don't, I just saw you go in there with Monica!
We'll just see.
Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.
Oh, it's easy. Yeah, I-I can do it with anything. Watch uh, Grandma's chicken salad...
Hey, uhh, I need to talk to you.
Come on! You like this woman, right?
Huh.
Forget about it.
I don't wanna give up the bag. I don't have to give up the bag! Do I Rach? Oh, you think I should give up the bag!
Well I don't like to say it out loud, but, yeah! Don't feel bad man, we all have our strengths. You're better with numbers and stuff.
Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me? Did you know this isn't Ma?
Hey!! We are so in luck! Treeger said that we could have all this cool stuff from the basement. Wait right there.
That's OK, Ross, you can ask me. What?
I look more like him than you do!
Get your non-believer ass outta my chair!
Hey! So, did you watch the tape of my show?
All right! You can have the chair.
Say it... say it!
Ah, anything we might of heard of?
Okay.
Maybe you changed?
Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, that's why I let people watch.
Hey.
Hey, how come, uhh, Chandler didn't come?
Ahh-oy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right Monica?
Thanks! I've been working out. Hey listen, is it obvious that I'm wearing six sweaters?
Hold on, you-you knew?
No-no-no, I'm serious. You don't smell it? Something's on fire.
And now for the great news.
Ross! Ross! If you're going to the airport, could you pick me up another one of those Toblerone bars?
What?!
You-you think?
He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes.
We did it!!
She's gone. She had a bag and she left.
Well you're whippin' so slow! Can't you do it any faster?
Whoa-whoa-hey-hey! Hi, Paul is it?
Yeah. So uh Ross, well now-why did that first marriage breakup? Was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian?
Picture? What picture?
Oh my God, I'm sorry, I'm being so rude. Rachel, would like a soda or something? Because Chandler would run right out and get it.
No.
What's the matter, Pheebs?
So that's it? It's over? Just like that?
You want to see her again, right?
With a man?
Yeah, big!
Hey.
I'm gonna be on two TV shows!
Y-sure!
Oh, yeah.
Hey, Felicity.
He hooked up!! Tell us about her!
Is everything okay?
Oh! Sorry. Uh, I've got those plans with Phoebe, why?
Ohhh, yeah!
Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man, it's a great part. Look, check it out. I'm the lead guy's best friend and I wait for him in this bar and save his seat. Listen-listen. 'I'm sorry, that seat's saved.'
What?
Hey, what's up?
Really? Thanks.
See, didn't I tell ya these pillows would be a good idea?
It's gonna be worth it. It's a known fact that women love babies, all righ? Women love guys who love babies. It's that whole sensitive thing. Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there. Maybe one of them will break away. No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left. All right, gimme the baby.
You're getting a cat?
Hey, Ross! What are you doin'?
Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, "Hey, how you doin'?"
I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know? Maybe a little longer.
Oh noo...
Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it.
Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.
You and me, next dance?
Morning.
Someone like an...angel?
Oh, just, y'know.... science.
Pheebs!!
Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.
Oh, well no problem there.
No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we'll be supportive like crazy.
Hi. We're the guys who called about the baby. We left the baby on ths bus. Is he here? Is he here?
I couldn't do it.
That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.
What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula.
Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.
All right, well I guess I'll just have to do what I do on dates.
That's 'cause sometimes I just do it through my wall to freak you out.
Yes.
All right, but in the future...
Yeah! All right? Let's go!
Do you guys have like a big bowl I can borrow?
Phoebe's a porn star!
So when do we get to meet the guy?
Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did! See what happens when you break the code?
Hi! How are the Gellers?
All right they got water, orange juice, and what looks like cider.
Yes! Yes! Unreasonable!
Ross. I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape.
No, no. He said "When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?"
Ooh, I'll play! I'll play!
Listen, do you guys think I have a chance with Janine?
Hey! You guys! Remember that audition I had a while ago and didn't get the part?
Well, you're timing couldn't be better. She's not my girlfriend anymore.
Can we come it yet?! We're dying out here!
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
So! Things can go wrong! You don't know! What if he doesn't make it?!
Well okay, so then you're fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as it's hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It's when the heat goes away, that's when you're in trouble.
Hey, I'm not interested in her sweater! It's what's underneath her sweater that counts. And besides, since ah, since when do you care who I'm going out with?
Pheebs! Pheebs! Ross wants to kiss you at midnight!
God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?
So the Porsche guy took his car back.
Yeah. Listen uh, I'd prefer it if you didn't call me Joey. Since I don't know anyone here, I thought it'd be cool to try out a cool work nickname.
Hey!!! Oww!! And I'm bleeding.
Hold on. Hold on. Rachel coming. Do...Something.
You play hard to get.
Okay, all right.
Really?
Glass of fat?
Okay uh, look I know you're a great actor, okay? And you play all those Shakespeare guys and stuff...
No-no-no I've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret?
Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried!
Awwwww!! Awwwwwww!!!
I don't know, Chandler is supposed to be passin' 'em around...
I don't wanna.
Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?
I got it.
Well he made Rachel cry!
Dude!
Yeah may-maybe you don't tell anyone about this.
From the land down under? I didn't know that either!
She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think.
It's 4:30.
Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked.
Okay, and ah, this one here is a Douglas Fir, now it's a little more money, but you get a nicer smell.
It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! This is great! I'm getting more dates than ever!
Oh-oh! So that's the way it's gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too y'know!
Hey Rach! Hey, you mind if I read my comic books in here?
Don't you ah, don't you wanna ask me any questions?
Hey. Y'know with that goatee you kinda look like Satan.
Oh, hey Katie! Everyone, this is Katie.
No, I'm good.
It is.
Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually.
Why? Why can't the world stop turning, just for a moment? Just for us?
Wow! Look at this! He wrote a check for 50,000 dollars to Hugo Ligrens Ring Design. Oh, sorry, what do you think the good news is?
Hey. What, what are you doing here?
Chandler giving you a hard time huh?
Oh! I know how you can get him, take off your bra.
Oh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay, maybe I'll talk about London! Y'know when you two hooked up! Only, only I won't say hooked up. I'll say, "Began their beautiful journey..."
Yeah, yeah, and the Indians taught the Pilgrims what it meant to be hot in the new world!
Okay.
Booo!!
...Yeah?
Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not.
What?
Yeah! But if would've know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn't have worried about it so much! See you around!
And of course, crotchless panties.
I'm, I'm okay. See.
Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?
Yeah, I thought I was pretty good too.
Oh! Maybe it's because I'm on television. I'm an actor on Days of Our Lives.
No kiddin', hmm.
Hey. That uh, that my sweatshirt?
Do you believe in ghosts, yes or no?
Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors!
Well, this has been great!
Wow, it is easy. Now, I can have milk everyday.
Yeah, the Knicks rule all!
But you said one.
Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming 'cause, 'cause her eyes keep going like this.
Ewwwww!
You're smart. I like that.
What, like there's a rule or something?
What is this? Fruit?
What?!! That's even worse!!
Let's go watch it at your place.
Wow! That was incredible! Beard of bees, here I come!
It'll be great for next weekend.
Sort of...
Oh, you bet I am!
Kristen?
Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?!
Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy. Aramis? Aramis?
no. No, I, I couldn't do that.
Well, that went well. Yeah.
From now on, it's gonna be Joey and Ross, best friends. Okay! We're gonna be the new Joey and Chandler.
Oh, hey! Joey Tribbiani.
What's the matter with Rog?
Hey, imagine if I never got fired off Days Of Our Lives! Oh-hey, there's Carol again!
And you're not supposed to be gossiping!!
Listen, I know you're new, but it's kinda understood that everything from Young Men's to the escalator is my territory.
Hey, if we know it can we have candy?!!
Man, I'm getting pretty tired. You're might have to take over soon.
Yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck got sick!
Guest.
I think face to face.
Actually, y'know it's kinda cold, so how about I keep my boxers on, and give you all a peek at the good stuff?
Who's Rick?
And I ah, borrowed some of your cologne. I hope she likes it.
Yes! I win again! Ha-ha! That's like 500 bucks you owe me! Whoo-ho-hoo! $500 that is a loooot of electricity! Whoo-ho-ho! I gotta buy some food.
Iced tea.
What?
Hey.
Yeah!
Yeah.
Blah?!
Oh, a couple of nurses asked them out. Maybe they're with them.
Oh and Okay, and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it, I learned something in acting class, try uh, rubbing your stomach or uh, or saying "mmm" and uh, oh oh! And smiling , okay?
Chandler!
You know what the. . .
All right, I'll take a box of the cream filled Jesus's.
Oh yeah.
Hey-ooh Pheebs, are they in there?
H-h-h-how's the duck?
Hey.
A two and a five.
I call Monica's room!
You are so the man! Now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, 'cause my Grandma doesn't know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah.
Why not?! I'm hungry.
What?!
Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket.
Look, the point is, there's a lot of women out there you haven't even had sex with yet!
Your sister stood me up the other night.
Ross, hey, the band's ready outside for your first dance with Emily, so...
"...Amy! Happy birthday to you!"
Hey! Now I'm a man of the cloth, but I still have feelings!
I'm sorry, it just felt nice.
Over the line?! You-you're-you're so far past the line, that you-you can't even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
Yeah. You okay?
That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.
Thank God!
Check it out!! Jam crackers!
Yeah, and not put us in the middle.
Chandler? A word.
Really?!
Hey.
That kinda sounds like your dream dude.
I don't know whether it's just 'cause we're breakin' up or... what, but you have never looked so beautiful.
I don't know how to lead.
I wanted to go to the strip club!
Well I guess I gotta start savin' up for Ross's birthday, so I guess I'll just stay home and eat dust bunnies.
Oh yeah, that's right!
Look, I don't have it all worked out yet, but it's gotta mean big money! Come on! Identical hands!
Wow! That was good. That was... Tweezers?
Road trip! Yeah, we can rent a car! I just have to be there by Tuesday!
Uhh, that's not them. I'm gonna go call the police.
And-and-and-and-and-and, and we're gonna be friends again!
Had the beef-tips, huh?
Hmm, soup. I mean, noodle soup. I mean soup!
Ohh. Wow! Well how-how, how will you be gone?
Thanks sweetheart. Give me a little sugar here. Okay.
All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel-Damnit!
Whoa-whoa-whoa. What ah, what happened to playing the field?
Im sayin I see a difference.
Hey Jessica.
But you haven't even heard the chorus!
Look, Ross, really it's-it's no big deal. Y'know you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can't be friends at work, then so be it. Y'know, hey I understand. Y'know? Hey, when I'm in a play and you're in the audience, I don't talk to you, right? So it's y'know, it's uh, it's cool. I'll see you tomorrow.
Yeah, okay.
That's ridiculous! I'm not a "Star," just a regular famous actor.
Two pizzas?!
You spit on me man!
Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does, ok. If you try to pull somethin', he'll call you on it. 'What're you tryin' to pull,' he'll say.
Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?
Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room.
I don't know. This little, old lady lives for my career. When they dumped me off of Days of Our Lives she almost died.
Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.
Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love.
Oh, ooh the food smells great, Mon!
Hey.
Not likely. 'Cause you see that body bag right there
Phoebs, that's OK. You took a big step today.
She was nothing compared to you.
Who's your friend? He's hot!
Ms. Monroe... Oh there you go.
The big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and it's at the perfect angle so you don't get any glare coming of off Stevie.
Nice!
Come on Ross! Look, I-I don't have any brothers; I'll never get to be a best man!
Lean-lean-lean!
Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast. You know, after having slept with her.
