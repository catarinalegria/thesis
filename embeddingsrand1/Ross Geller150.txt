Smooth man. Yeah, you got some chilie on your neck. Well, I just want to say, thanks everyone, this-this was great. And hey! See you guys Monday morning. Thanks Joey.
You know what, this is ridiculous, ok. This is your birthday, this is your party. I say we just put 'em all together and if they can't deal with it, who cares.
Hello! Hello!
Hey.
Okay!
I know, I wasn't finished. But don't worry! We're gonna go down the fire escape!!
Is uh, is Monica here?
Wait! It was my plan.
Yes I am.
And that is why we cannot see each other anymore.
Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this. And sometimes I may be away longer, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this.
Ssshh.
Uh, nothing, nothing's with him. Enjoy your coffee.
Yeah, but you're making me look bad!
Monica, if you want, I can lend you some money.
And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
Scotch. Alright, I'll be back in 10 seconds with your scotch on the rocks in a glass.
Apparently she fell in the shower and hit her head.
Hey-hey, since you're the 'fix-it' lady, here's a pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesn't want to have the wedding at all?
Events from around the globe.
OK, turn around. I just don't want you staring at me when I'm doing this.
I see. So what do you propose to do?
She wants me to move to London.
Fine, just stop thinking about me.
Can I come over tomorrow and pick up Fluffy Meowington's cat toy.
No, they're not.
I'll take it. My gift to you man.
What?
Well let there-what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says, "You ride this bike or I'll sh...I'll shoot you."
Small...
Great! Great! You're making the bike very happy.
Then tell him quickly.
Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?
Oh, oh Chandler...
Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work.
Oh, sure! I'm sure.
No!
I can't believe this!!
My nana used to do it. That's how she paid for all my dance-karate lessons.
That's a duck.
What? What? Was that a joke? 'Cause it's mean.
Ok, ok, number one: The way you cry at game shows. Number two: how much you love your friends. Number three: the way you play with your hair when you're nervous. Number four: how brave you are for starting your life over. Number five: how great you are with Ben.
Hey, we can rescedule for Saturday.
OH...MY...GOD!!
OK. Oh, oh, oh.
He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...
Hey!
Wh-wh-what line? The line that prompted a student in my last class of the day to say uh, "Dude, don't you ever was your face?"
You're welcome.
I'm here.
OK, now, sit. OK.
Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part... But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.
The head, the head. You gotta...
You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.
Monica said that did she?
Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back- come here, Marcel-
C'mon Monica, do it. Hey, you guys, um, Monica has some news.
Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?
Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that.
Okay, okay. This morning you said there was nothing so big that we couldn't work past it together...
Oh really? What uh, what does he want with her?
Yeah?
Right, um, but, on Hanukkah, Hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle. See, years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees.
Maybe it's a universal thing?
Pretty please? Not very uh, 007.
Can you believe this? We're gonna be on the platform for the Millennium moment!
...and it was Ernst Muhlbrat who first hypothesized that the Velociraptor would expand it's collar and emit a high pitched noise to frighten it's predator. Yes Mr. Lewis?
I don't know, aheh, your's was the first name that-that popped into my head, I'm I'm sorry. I-I didn't think it would matter.
I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself. Everyone's all, "Ross you have to be funny and sexy." Well, I proved them wrong! And now, I'm gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler.
Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!
You've had feelings for me?
Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.
Y'know if we ever go to war and you're captured, you're in for a big surprise.
Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that much trouble.
Well just hold him like you'd hold a football.
Well, I'm sorry, but ah, look if you're not working with him anymore, why do you have to still do stuff with him?
Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson.
No, you started it.
Yeah, yeah, it'll be great! You can, you can lay on the beach and I can cry over my failed marriage. See-see how I make jokes?
Ohh. . . Thanks Rach, goodnight.
...is for me not to see you anymore.
You slept with my sister?
Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche I'll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.
What? Sophie, does she have ten minutes?
What are you guys doing later?
Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay.
Uh... Oh hey, do you, uh ...do you have any, um, Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?
Hey Pheebs, what-what was the deal with you and Chandler blowing us off before?
Hey.
And the place looks so nice!
Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!
...will be two months...
Nobody likes change.
How, how, um how can you not be going?
Hey.
Hey, anyone hear from Phoebe yet?
A what?
No, she likes that. Yeah. Faking sleep doesn't work either, I can't tell you how many mornings I woke up with her...
Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son.
Ah! Oh.
I have an oily T-zone!
I played bad on purpose guys.
Yeah, me too.
Are you angry at me because I said your handwriting is childlike?
What you got over there? Tacos?
Gandolf the wizard. Hello! Didn't you read Lord of the Rings in high school?
And they knew about it?
Ben! I mean, Ben! Ben!
Hey!
Same difference.
Hey!
Yes, but also Hanukkah! See, you're part Jewish, and-and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday.
Awwwahuh, no, no, no!!
Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone.
Okay, okay, okay.
You can't do that!
I know.
Okay.
Goodnight.
Yeah! We'd meet, we'd meet total strangers, and hang out with them!
Well, there you go.
That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.
Look, Chandler, it's my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel any better they don't print the name, so it doesn't really matter who gets credit, right?
Come on, you know they love you.
A-A day.
That's right! That's right! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat so the pee goes everywhere!
That'd be good...
Good! That's good!
Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella. Don't, don't just dismiss this so fast. I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...
All right, ready?
Ah, that's okay, thanks.
What? What?
Rach? Hi!
Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger?
Yeah.
You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.
Come here, Marcel. Sit here.
Right. No biggie. Stay loose.
I tired attacking two women, did not work.
Anyway. That's when our Mom said we were not to play football ever again.
One-Mississippi, two-Mississippi, switch! Switch! Switch!!
And what are you going to do for him?
We, we just decided to uh, to go for it.
Shut up.
Yeah, okay.
Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me?
What, so this guy is helping you for no apparent reason?
Yeah, no one talks like that!
I don't know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then.
Can't we just use a pen?
