That, that is funny. That is painfully funny. No, wait. Wait, yeah, that's just painful
Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by "bye!"
What'd you say?
G'night.
Look, I-I drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it. Okay Rach, that's you. That's the couch.
You had fantasies about Emily?
I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?
Oh really? What uh, what does he want with her?
We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!
No! No we don't!
Oh, who cares?
Hey!
Hi.
What, what's that?
And why do you care so much?
It's the off light. Right Ross?
Look, I... Look, I'm having a great time with you and I just don't want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us. So, I'm sorry I just don't think we should go away together yet. It's-it's too soon.
Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? I'm fine, I'm fine.
I do-I do not have a boyfriend. There's a guy in one of my classes who-who has a crush on me.
But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.
Okay. So well I'll umm, I'll have her home by midnight.
Yeah.
Uh Joey, that's just the minumum amount due, that's your total due.
Oh, well, when you don't have the cards, you don't have the cards, you know. But, uh... look how happy she is.
Yeah? Well, I-I think Ben's asleep.
Hot dog?
I bet if I talk to Carol and Susan I can convince them to move to London with Ben.
Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y'know no commitment.
Getting it away from me would be job one.
I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me.
Because you sent away the dog!
Carol our sex life is-it's just not working...
For what?
Hey uh, well, today's my first lecture and I kinda wanted to try it out on you guys, do you, do you mind?
Oh yeah! So ah, kinda pretty, pretty good. He sounds like a nice, good guy.
Okay.
That's cool.
I get it! Well, that's that.
You okay?
How was I supposed to know we'd end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister?
Yes.
We know!
They published my paper.
My marriage is over.
Yes! My baby's finally free!
With you?! Yeah right!
That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! Oh, let's see now he had the trampoline.
Oh. And what do you call that?
Don't thank me! If you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization. Here's Warren's number.
I went to Egypt with my dad.
Hey! It's starting to snow.
Ow! Ow! Okay, okay, fine, fine! All right, you wanna win by cheating, go ahead, all right. Phoebe the touchdown does count, you win.
That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross... Uh-oh.
Marc- oh, this is ridiculous! We've been all over the neighbourhood. He's gone, he's-he's just gone.
Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in college. I mean that's-that's when I really found my sound.
Uh, yeah! I still can't believe she hates Pottery Barn!
Oh no-no-no! Oh-no! No! No! Emily!
I'm having a baby in here! Ok, everyone stand back. Ow.
I'm going to do it.
That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!
Really? Its not just frowned upon?
Pretty cool, huh?
Like 'em, like 'em? Or, I'd like to get store credit for that amount like 'em?
Excuse me?
Yeah!
Oh, wait! Wait! Don't you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe you'll get that job!
I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!
That's okay, I mean it was just two-week thing anyway, I just didn't want it to end this way, y'know?
Hi! What's ah, what's Mark doing answering your phone?
It's a rug.
Well, I uh, I can't seem to find the monkey I donated last year. He's a capuchan, answers to the name Marcel.
Mmm-Hmm.
Oh, no!
Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo.
It was, it was great. Oh, what happened?
What?!
Jill, how did you pay for all this? I thought your dad took away your credit card.
All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything's kinda pink.
Oh yeah, we're uh, yeah we're not together.
Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.
Ok, what, what...ok, what did we think it was going to be?
What's that supposed to mean?
No. I am not putting on makeup.
Yep?
Yes, you can, very much.
What?
Chandler!
Yeah.
Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue.
Oh fine.
These-these are beads of joy.
Hey! What's she doing back here?
He left that.
Ooh! There's no way to do this without her? 'Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.
That sounds great. Same for me.
It's heads. Gentlemen, pick your category.
Hey.
Emily, there is nothing between Rachel and me. Okay? I love you.
What'd you do, take him whaling?
I don't know what to do. What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare.
Look, I'm sorry, I thought it looked pretty.
There is no way I am letting you drive this car! So why don't you just hand over the keys?
Hello!
Calm down. There's no reason to get testy.
That's it, your doing great.
Oh, thank you. Hey, hey. Rachel!!!!
Well, I don't know.... huh-huh.... but I'm hoping huh-huh.
No.
Dear Lord!!
Yeah, take your time.
Hi? Sorry, we got disconnected...
What?
No thank you for... Thank you.
I'm gonna pay for that tonight.
Yeah.
Oh, I uh, hope you don't mind, I kinda uh, jazzed it up a little. Check this out. We will, we will, call you back!
Hey there little fella! Hey, uh-hey, why don't we get some shoes on ya, huh? Hey, why don't you show dad how you can put your shoes on, in your room! Yay!!
Sorry.
Are you sure? Hold on. I'm sorry you guys, that was a coffee and a....
Joey, get out of the fridge.
No?
Please tell me you're joking.
What are you, what are you doing?
Yeah, i-it's for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they don't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them to give us the boit'sit's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. So here's my itinerary . Um... here's a picture of me...
All right, see you later.
It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?
I uh, I just got back from uh, from Julie's.
Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don't you think you could at least hear the guy out?
Hi, we're visitiing. It's Ben and his da-da. Da-da. Can you say da-da? Look, I'm gonna tell your momies you said it anyway so you might as well try.
Yeah?
Are you sure?
I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
Yeah.
Joey?!
Dude, you didn't say Die Hard. Is everything okay?
Right?
Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the matter with you?
No! No! Wh... What are you doing?!! GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Gimme the this!
This year was supposed to be great! But, it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!
Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?
All right here. Watch me execute the three 'P's of championship play. Power. Precision. and penache.
Fine.
Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.
No, you started it.
Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?
Fine. You'll-you'll watch it on video when we get back.
Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily, honey, okay?
Ugh.
Oh, I'm just over here with Ben. I thought we'd say hi.
