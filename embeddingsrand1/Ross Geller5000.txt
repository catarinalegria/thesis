Perhaps. Now I'm curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to kick my ass?
No... No... No. I think I should stay, I think we should both know whats going on.
Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here-but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?
717? Where's 717? Hey, you've have more of these for Susan right?
Thank you. C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a little mingling? Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later.
All right.
Yeah, have a seat.
Rach...
I go back there with lawn ornaments, he's going to laugh in my face.
C'mere, Marcel.
Hi!
I get it! Well, that's that.
No, but, but I wanna be with you in spite of all those things.
Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard's son, you'd be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather.
Ahhh.
I mean, uh, who... who cares about a little sloppiness?
No.
Bye.
Oh come on, not again.
Well, I do! Why don't we go back to my place, light a couple of candles, break open a box of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties, uh...
What?
Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well.
And, and uh, you-you remember my friend Chandler.
I know! I'm saying you have to watch them all the time.
Y'know what? I think we've seen enough, let's turn it off.
She's not even here yet.
Hi, Julie. Hi, Julie. Julie, um, how are you?
Well look, I'm just trying to focus on the "I get to see my wife," part, all right? And not the part that makes me do this.
Well, y'know how I'm trying to work things out with Emily. Well, there's this one thing... Okay, here goes. I made a promise that--Oh hey!
Okay! Okay! Okay! It's okay. It's okay. Hey, it's too weird for you, I won't see her again.
Look, don't worry about me. Okay? I'll just stay real energetic and stay away from the ball. I'll uh, I'll be that guy right out of the circle.
That's right!
Because! Because, it-it-it's... It'd be like you having this guitar and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar wants to be played! And-and this bike wants to be ridden and-and if you don't ride it you-you're-you're killing its spirit! The bike is dying.
Yeah.
Ohh...
I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...
Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy.
Ahhhh!!
You're over me?
We're not alone.
Yeah, well it came to about $112, but what the hell, just call it an even 110?
Susan...
I.....got.....dressed. Really, really quickly. Okay, okay. There we go, there we go.
Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y'know no commitment.
Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.
Oh no, not yet.
Hi.
Look, we're just friends now! Okay? Why would I do anything stupid?
Well, that's cool. So did...
Thanks.
I, er...
What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer.
Oh mom! Okay, umm, her name is Carol. And she's really pretty. And smart. And uh, she's-she's on the lacrosse team and the golf team. Can you believe it? She plays for both teams!
What's up?
Rachel! Well, you-you're not at home, you're-you're-you're right here.
Oh, come on, now you know you want 'em.
Sweetie, calm down, it's gonna be okay.
I was having a little chat with ah, Bonnie, and ah, guess what, she-she happened to bring up y'know, who was behind the um, whole head shaving idea, and now, who was it? Oh, that's right, that's right, it was you!
And we didn't have sex.
What?! What is with everybody? It's Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day!
Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year.
Yeah, how does Jason look in a v-neck?
That's cool.
I'll get it.
She said, "Thank you." I said, "I love you." And she said, "Thank you."
What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?
Hey!
I do-I do not have a boyfriend. There's a guy in one of my classes who-who has a crush on me.
Eh, no problem.
Oh, we were helping Chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out because Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions.
Come on out, honey! I'm telling you look good! Tell her she looks good, tell her she looks good.
Yes, of course they like you!
Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops?
Hey!
Oh, thank you. Hey, hey. Rachel!!!!
You still love me?
I know.
Why? Why can't you go to him?
So were you in Nam?
Dude! That's my sister!
How do you know? I mean we thought Carol was straight before I married her!
Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!
This is-you-
No no, you're uh, you're my lobster. See um, lobsters, uhh, in the tank when, when they're old, uhh, they get with, uhh, they walk around holding the claws. In the tank, ya know, with, with the holding and. . . Uhh, Phoebs you wanna help me out with the, the whole lobster thing?
Aw, how can you say that? I cant even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid?
Yes, you can, very much.
And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend. And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.
Okay.
Oh my God, he just said your name, that's great! Good job Ben.
Okay.
Uh, sweetie we've gotta go.
What's the matter? You okay?
Oh, well this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousin Nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know.
Hey! What's up?
Don't yell at me okay, this is the most I've seen you all week.
What do I do now?
Oh my God, you guys!!
Put it back exactly where you found it?
Hi.
Of course she would, you're a college man.
Sure, do whatever you want.
Take thee, Emily. Like there'd be anybody else.
Yes, tell me.
Yeah... I guess. I don'tI don't know. Alright, just... just give her this for me, OK?
And; people thinking it's huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder. Which we are not!
Spiderman?
If you wanna call that a reason.
And she's supposed to buy this?!
Good morning.
Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?
Mi-mi-mii.
I am, uh, I am...
That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I use your bathroom?
Just stuff. Y'know kinda what Emily wants.
No, Susans gonna be there too. Weve got dads, weve got lesbians, the whole parenting team.
No! No we don't!
Yes.
You're not going to go.
Y'know, maybe she is too young for me. Y'know, when I was over there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby-sitter. I finally started to see what you guys were talking about. I don't know what to do.
I'm gonna pay for that tonight.
It hurts my teeth.
Yeah I am! Yeah, Ben got a second audition!
Oh. And what do you call that?
No. I think you misunderstood what I was saying. What I meant was...
Look, okay-okay I had food poisoning! It's not like I choose to do it! It's not like-It's not like I said, "Umm, what would make this ride more fun?!"
No.
Uh-hmm.
Well, OK, I uh, I have to. I can't deal with this right now. I mean, I've uh, y'know, I've got a cab, I've got a girlfriend, I'm... I'm gonna go get a cat.
Oh I-, Oh wait, Tony can you hang on? That's the other line. Hello. Oh yeah she's here but uh, can she call you back? OK thanks. Call Joanna. Hi.
Wha, what?
Why?
Yeah, so uh, is it sore or can you do stuff?
What?
Hmm?
I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk before.
I'm telling you, there's no way he's moving back.
Yeah.
There y'go.
What? Where?
Kiwi? Kiwi? I thought it was a key lime pie.
The big deal is I don't want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzle-beer! Cold beer.
I don't know what to say.
Oh, oh, you're... uh... you're, oh you're the date.
Carol, honey, shhh, shhh, everythings gonna be alright.
What?! What?! Talking about what?!
Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.
Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben. 'A real American hero. I'm G.I. Joe!' Drop the Barbi, drop the Barbi.
And, uh, and then I kissed her.
I'm sorry, man. Hey, y'know what you should do? You should make something happen for yourself. Y'know, like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean, what about those Good Will Hunting guys?
She said you gave her the razor!
I don't know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will do it. I'll go over and I will borrow something. Juice!! I need juice!!
All right, look, look, you've got to do this yourself, okay in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.
Well, what about me?! I'm a medical marvel!!
Yes. And another time after that. Boy I'm getting hungry! Hey Joey, have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you eat some of her food?
Hey.
Are you OK?
Okay-okay! Two very good points, look I've known you both a long time, and I've never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you've been since you've got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?
Yeah, not since I got too strong for you.
...But a man can change.
Celia, don't worry! Don't scream! He's not going to hurt you! Soothing tones, Celia. Soothing tones! Marcel...
You grow up.
Well I, I don't know. Why?
Hello?
That guy, he burns me up.
Uh, hello dad! Monica and I just saw the house in the paper! Yes we're surprised! Who did you leave a message with?
Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so...
Whoa, sorry Tommy.
Yeah, see, I don't think it's gonna that difficult considering this one won't be taking place in the basement of a Pizza Hut.
Sometimes, you should come over sometime! I'll play you one of my other...
It's, uh... it's endearing, really.
You didn't tell her?! Okay, fine! Pheebs?
You want me to call her right now?
Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get so much done on the commute. I-I've been given the gift of time!
Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi.
This is perfect! She'll have to come back here with your pizza, and when she does, I'll turn on the Charm-O-Ross. Oh I'm so glad you don't eat meat.
Hey, Mon.
Why would I tell him?
I am your friend.
He is my girlfriend's father, okay? It's-it's, it's weird!
No.
No, because your not upset.
What-what is love really?
Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.
No, I stayed at Julie's last night.
Oh, that's me.
Oh yeah it's fine. I guess the more muscles you have the more they can spasim out of control.
'Cause, I'm a stupid, stupid man.
Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says 'Jack Geller, so predictable'. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say 'Buried at sea! Huh!'.
Um, no.
Which one is Gina?
Yeah-no, just that last song.
No. You're just gonna have to accept the fact that you're just friends now, OK, you're not... rommmates anymore.
Why-why can't you take a couple of days off?
What?
Hey lady! I don't care how much you want it! Okay?! I am not gonna to have sex with you in the bathroom!
Yeah, no problem.
So Rachel called. Wants to see me. Going over in a minute.
Hey!
All right. All right, I'm gonna do it!
Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can't decide between the two of them. Y'know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she's a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown. Y'know she's, well she's-she's just as pretty, I guess she's smart, she's not fun.
There's nothing the matter with me. See, I'm not completely devoid of sentiment, see I have feelings.
Just a high pitched intimidating noise.
You can totally, totally live on this.
Y'know if we ever go to war and you're captured, you're in for a big surprise.
What are you, what are you doing?
Wha-, you have a phone in here?
Shh. Do you want cran-apple or cran-grape?
Good evening officer.
"Hi Rach, are you there? It's me, pick up. Rachel. Rach!"
You ah, wanted to see me?
Monica, uh Dad called this morning and ah, Aunt Silvia passed away.
Here, go nuts.
What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.
Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family?
Thanks Rach.
He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!
I-They would not let us get married when we were that drunk!
Hey, what took you guys so long? Your cab left when ours did!
Why?
Are you insane? C'mere, Marcel, c'mon.
No no, you're fine, you're fine.
Thirty seconds, all the questions you can answer.
I... I do, I do not love Rachel. I'm gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay? Would I do that if I loved her?
Oh, yeah, no problems. It's all taken care of.
Thanks.
I got it. So hi, I'm uh, I'm Ross and this is my friend Chandler.
Ohhhhh yeah, that's, that's funny. Why ah, why isn't he goofing around in his own office?
How come it's always us left in the field holding the ball?
I know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though Nana's gone there's, there's something almost, uh- I dunno, almost life-aff-
Fine.
So, do we really have to ask who's going up on the platform next?
Hey uh, y'know that smell gas has?
Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York, I'm sure everything will be fine.
Monica!
Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay.
Nooooo!
Aw, right.
Chloe, Chloe how's it coming?!!
When, when were you... under me? Rach. Rachel do you, I mean, were you, uh. . . What?
Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn't make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say 'Like me! Like me tiny doctor!'
My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over.
You weren't there! Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to seize! Y'know?
It came in the mail today, it's uh, 72 long-stemmed red roses, one for each day that I've known and loved Emily, cut up into mulch!
Hey!
Are you all right?
What is this dive? Only you could've picked this place.
What are you doing?
That little naked guy would be me.
Give me two.
No, you stop!
Umm, I'm sorry Judy, I couldn't find that bowl that you and Jack were looking for.
The actress!
Why? What?
This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.
Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.
Ooooohh!
Umm, oh, hey, I don't know. How about a big one?
Well, John McLane had plans!
You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
Uhh, yeah it would! Let's do it!
All I'm saying is, it's one thing being prepared for an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack, I don't know, like a surprise!!
And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.
How hot is this?!
I guess he musta gotten the part in that play.
What?
Wait a minute, are you doing that thing where you pretend it didn't go well but it really did go well?
Well, not right now. Okay look, Monica came here for some memories and damnit, we're gonna give her some! Okay, grab...grab some empty boxes. Okay? We'll-we'll take stuff from mine and whatever we can pass off as hers we'll-we'll put 'em in their.
Yeah, maybe.
Okay! Okay. Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.
Well umm, oh! I might be teaching another class this semester!
Oh, that's not true! I've got her lots of stuff she never took back.
Hi everyone.
No.
Fine. I'll go.
Goodnight.
Really? That's great!
It's breast milk.
Move in with me.
I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!
Good.
I'm, I'm sorry you didn't get to go to Spacecamp, and I'm hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it. Presenting Sarah Tuttle's Private Very Special Spacecamp!!
Okay, it's not, it's not.
Hi.
Hi.
And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!
Yeah Pheebs, come on, you two have completely different styles. Y'know, she's more.. y'know, and you're more
No, actually I was just saying it looks like we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that night... It was the first frost...
You take your time.
Oh no-no-no, it's my pleasure.
Actually, no, we're not.
I'm sorry I'm late, did I miss anything?
Hey, what have you guys been up to?
Can you please not do that feet first? You know where his injury is! Severed toe, you just said it!
So it's really a question of who could you have possibly done.
Yeah, well...nah.
Ugh, museum.
Nono, she's gone.
Okay, okay, fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yogart, or something..
Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it.
All right, I just wanted to check.
My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?! H-how?! How could this all happen?!
Oh my god. You are pure evil.
Are you serious?
You will?!
She is not... She's gay. Oh my God. She is so gay! I can't believe this.
Oh shoot, tomorrow's not so good, I'm supposed to um, fall off the Empire State building and land on a bicycle with no seat. Sorry.
I went to Egypt with my dad.
Because it's weird!
No, no, we will. We just won't tell her she messed up.
Sure! Oh, and Joey's got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.
Yeah, yeah. I got a lemon schmush.
Well, who's gonna kiss my sister.
Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe- ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'.
Just please stop!
Hi.
Le Poo's still alive?!
Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date. She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not broad backed!
Who's your roommate?
Fighting?!
Okay, look, we have nineteen minutes. Okay, Chandler, I want you to go and change! Okay. And then, when you come back, Joey will go change, and he'll have vacated the chair. Okay. Okay.
Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! Okay.
Okay, that-that's enough! Y'know, let's, let's let someone else play.
Oh, well, when you don't have the cards, you don't have the cards, you know. But, uh... look how happy she is.
Or that.
No-no-no-no-no.
Yes, we have to tell her!
Okay, well here we are. Now we're in a tough spot again, Rach. What do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do you wanna bail? Look, I, I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing. Okay? And I'm sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I can't. I just can't see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much.
Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.
Okay.
Hey Joe did... Did you ever have a threesome?
No!!
Hold on.
... and that's the story of the dreidle. Now, some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising life's triumph over death. And that was like 4000 years ago.
Hey!
Wow! What a pleasure.
No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Pretty sure, they both think I'm interested in them.
Well, they're not mine!
Okay, you are totally making this up.
No, that's, no, as long as you're okay. So I'll ah, I'll see you tomorrow.
Oh no-no-no! Oh-no! No! No! Emily!
Ben! I mean, Ben! Ben!
You are totally jealous.
You still on that?
Yeah?
You comin'?
Look I was going to tell you!
Y'know what? I'm gonna go out on a limb and say no divorces in '99!
I don't know! Just-just talk to him-entertain him and keep him alive.
Hey guys.
Well, I don't know.... huh-huh.... but I'm hoping huh-huh.
And what are you going to do for him?
That's what you said last night.
Well I guess you can start by drivin a cab on Another World.
Hmm.
What do you mean?
You sure?
Okay. Wow, it's-it's 5:30 in the morning. So, I'd better get cracking on this baby.
I'm gonna get you to talk to Chandler.
Okay. All right. So let's see, let's play from the trash can, to the lightpost. Right. Two hand touch, we'll kick off.
Well, howdya feel?
Look, you guys, you guys should go. No, I'm, you, you planned this all out, and I don't want to ruin it, so you guys should just go.
Hey listen can you do me a big favor? The dean's office just called and said there was an urgent meeting. Can you watch Ben for like an hour?
Hey Rach!
What?
That's a good point.
Is this?!
It's just a fur ball.
Five.
Lady, he is people. He has a name, okay? He watches Jeopardy! He he touches himself when nobody's watching. Please, please have a heart!
Wow, well uh, uh, actually, Julie's downstairs getting a cab, I just need the cat toy, did Monica say. . . What? Why, why are you looking at me like that?
Okay, that's right, yes, but on Hanukkah, uh, we sing, uh Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
For your information, it's a card sharp, not a card shark.
Going out with who?
Good! That's good!
Hey!
Ah.
OK.
Yeah.
Phoebe.
Okay, okay, I'm sorry, it will never happen... Uh-oh! Wait a minute! Wait-wait, now there are a hundred of you and I'm the king.
I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job.
No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel?
Look, all I know is I-I can't have another failed marriage!
Oh, it's not so bad. Monica's gonna make potpourri! I think I'm gonna go wander out in the rain for a while.
Okay, I'm done with my choices, these are final.
Over my dead body!
Are we really in Montreal?!
Well, I'm gonna lie to you Joey, it's a possibility.
Yeah?
We need more cards.
I couldn't.
Hey, Fun Bobby!
Um, that is because my doctor says that I have a very serious.... nuget.... diffency.
Check it out! Almost 3 hours without droppin' it!
Okay, I know what I have to do. I've got to go Red Ross. Y'know, Red Ross!
You wanna buy a car?
Well uh, it's cause he had a thing with, wi-, with the thing.
Look, this is a disaster! Can't I please just go?
Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?
Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.
Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-your nakedness?
Hey, it's been like three weeks!
Wow. Umm... Huh... I'm-I'm not sure what to do with that right now.
Come on.
Uh, yeah, I ah, I also need two.
Hi!
I know.
You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know we haven't actually met...
Men. I guy I know.
Hey guys!
C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,...
Yep.
What? Come on Rach, tell me what you're thinking?
Yeah.
Eh, her-her uncle already had planned on doing it. And y'know, we-we said our good-byes this morning, so...
Bye.
Monica, you're so lucky! He's like the most popular guy in school!!
Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?
Hi.
It was, it was her voice.
Dude!
So, we're off.
Yeah. There's no breaking them up, is there?
By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me.
They don't look any bigger than me!
I'm sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but I-look, I just want you guys to be safe. DANGER!!!!! Ahhh, huh? Unagi.
Where the hell have you been?
Well we-we don't know for sure. But in my head it-it sounded something like this. Of course, this is just conjecture. Okay, that's uh, that's all for today. Uh Mr. Morse, can I see you for a moment?
A lesson in the importance of unagi.
Can we, can we just forget this ever happened?
Joey, some people don't like that.
You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?
Ohh, what's wrong?!
Oh, oh, we did say we'd stop by this little thing Joey's roommate is having.
Oh! Well then this is awkward. So what do you uh...
Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum.
Look I-I realize if anything were to happen with me and Jill then nothing could ever happen with us!
Yeah, but not very well, unless 14-across, 'Gershwin musical' actually is bitemebitemebitemebiteme.
No? What happened, big guy?
It was, it was great. Oh, what happened?
Oh, it's not the ideal way...
Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the Cupert-Hewitt museum.
Yeah.
Oh yeah, yeah? Well uh, when we were going out, I read tons of porno magazines! 'Sup?
Good.
What, uh... what juggling thing?
It's just, it's, it's me. You, you know I've only been with one woman my whole life and she turned out to be a lesbian. So now I've got myself all psyched out, you know, and it's become, like this, this thing and I. . . Well, you just must think I'm weird.
And it'll be cool to see it again! Yeah!
No, no-no, Ross Geller.
Hiiiiii.
Honey, I love you too.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's with the tackling?
You're nose is bleeding!

Joshua...guy at that club, dancing and having a good time, the thought of it kinda...y'know.
Come on, come on, we're-we're-we're lighting the candles!
Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater.
No. No, uh, Phoebs? You can'tyou can't do...
Okay, let's go.
Hey, anyone hear from Phoebe yet?
Oh that is so great! That's...
Oh, no, no.
Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot. Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun.
Ahh, what's a little mid-life crisis between friends?
Hi!
What's with her?
Hi!
That's what I'm telling you.
Well, I uh, I can't seem to find the monkey I donated last year. He's a capuchan, answers to the name Marcel.
Yeah, but you're making me look bad!
Y'know what? I'm really not in the mood.
Well, I-I was watching her the other day at the pizza place.
We uh, we just cooked it up.
Yay!!
Why aren't you guys dressed?
ON A CAT??!!!!
Well that I can believe.
Maybe I'll take her to that new French restaurant down the street...
Hey Chandler, what are you doing tonight?
Look...
No! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! You can have this back when the five pages are done! Ahh!
No.
No! The guy is mean. I mean really mean. I think you should stay away from him.
Can I come over tomorrow and pick up Fluffy Meowington's cat toy.
Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not, quite..
You damn kids! You ring my bell one more time, I swear to... Ohh, uh Jill. Umm, that-that's just a little game I play with the kids down the hall. Umm, they've really taken a liking to me. Uhh what's-what's-what's the matter?
Maybe I should get another pair! Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with fringe all down the sides. I'm gonna go kiss Ben goodnight. I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy. I would make a good cowboy.
Ben, you ready? All right, gimme your foot. Ok, on three, Ben. One, two, three. Ok, That's it, Ben.
Yeah. The doctor got the 'K' out. He also found an 'M' and an 'O'.
Huh?

That was different!
They published my paper.
Yeah? Well, I-I think Ben's asleep.
What?
Eww! No!! Her ear! All right, Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?
This is not fun!
I'm divorced! I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!
No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?
Man, look at all those stars! Infinite space. It really, really makes you wonder, doesn't it?
Yes! Wow, well, that-that was easy. Okay, you-you go.
No no, no no, it's not flashy, not for a Goodfella.
Anyway, if she, if she wasn't in to me, why-why would she ask me out again?
Good! Me neither! So it's not a problem. We're just two friends who happen to be roommates.
Now umm, remember I'm still learning.
Oh my God! Monica!
Correct, his profession was?
Tell my son that I love him. Excellent! Well, okay, I gotta have some more fun!
Yeah.
You are not putting that on again! Marcel, OKif you press that button, you are in very, very big trouble.
That was you?
Not on you! On the stripper!
Joey where's the pipe that was holding the door open?
Go.
Okay.
Hey, Rach, can I get some coffee?
Noo, nnnnn. What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?
When you put a 'D' at the end of 'Fine' you're not fine.
What are you guys doing?
Well? Isn't that amazing?

Oh, no no, I am.
We'll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth-me.
Hey!

Did you get Monica's authorization to move all of her stuff?
And that's Phoebe over there!
Hey, guys!
But hey, it's not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides never sit together.
It's ridiculous!
Look, this is just a little too familiar, okay? For like, for Like six months before Carol and I spilt up, all I heard was "My friend Susan is so smart. My friend Susan is so funny. My friend Susan is so great."
Oh my God! That's Rachel naked! I can't look at that! I am looking at this. Okay, vivid colors, expressive brush strokes-Unless she wants me to be looking at that. She knows I'm home. She knows I can see her. What kind of game is she playing? I think maybe someone's lonely tonight. Oh-ho, Dr. Geller! Stop it! You're being silly! Or, am I?
And now you want that money back.
Dude, I need to talk to you a sec.
Thank you, thanks. Yeah, I lost it. Y'know, I'm not gonna play anymore, would you, can you finish my set?
Okay, hey, that's okay with me. Two down and I have exactly twelve minutes.... Wha, my watch stopped. My watch. Okay, see, the, the dinosaur tail isn't going around any more. What time is it? It's 7:33, I have seven minutes. I have seven minutes!!
Wow. I'm sorry, when I was a kid I lost a bike to that.
Well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine, he's just sleeping now.
Alright...
Joey, I figured you'd understand. I mean, I-I've known him a lot longer.
We fell asleep! That is all.
What happened?!!
I can.
All right, the score is nine to eight in favor of the guys. Ladies if you miss this the game is theirs, pick your category.
Oh my God! Those weren't albino kids, that was computer camp! Rach!
Sir Limps-A-Lot, I came up with that.
Hey guys.
Oww!! My ankle! I really hurt my ankle! I think I twisted it when I-Ooh, a quarter!
Look, I... Look, I'm having a great time with you and I just don't want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us. So, I'm sorry I just don't think we should go away together yet. It's-it's too soon.
Oh, be-because of the leather pants.
Oh God. Y'know, botanists are such geeks.
I fell asleep!
Good, so do I
I'm getting ready for the water skiing. How are you doing?
That word was swans.
How could you not tell us?
Excuse me sir, you've got a little something right here.
Okay, you wanna play rough, we can play rough.
Hey, you're a doctor of gums. That's the smallest body part you can major in. It's like day one, floss. Day two, here's your diploma.
Well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble.
Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away.
Sorry. 'Cause umm, I think this will make you a little more sophisticated.
That is an old, Chinese woman!
It's not something you are! It's something you have!
They have another guess.
I could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back.
I cannot believe we're having this conversation.
Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? I'm fine, I'm fine.
Well, there you go.
Oh God.
Hi!
Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y'know no commitment.
Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, I'm a doctor, and I had a monkey. I'm Doctor Monkey!
Yeah!
Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.
And if you wait right here, I'll go get Ross.
Listen, I-I need a favor. Umm, I was in the shower, and as I was cleansing myself, I ah, I-I, well I felt something.
That is one good looking man!
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh..........
Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.
Oh. Oh-oh.
She's not Rachel.
...once you know the stories, it's not that bad. First marriage, wife's hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldn't allow you to get married when you're that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevada's fault.
Noo. Why?
I was hugging her as a friend. It's not my fault her-her hair got in my face, she's got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh...coconutty. What?! Oh, that doesn't mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts!
There's this kid in my class who said he's in love with me.
What? A-ohh! Ohh. Oh that's right that's right. That's Richard's favorite place too.
Yeah! Right!
In London!
Celebrities I'm allowed to sleep with.
Well, I'm gonna go see her. I want to bring her something, what do you think she'll like?
That's it, your doing great.
All right. I think it was a mouse.
Well, we believe it originated here. In the Aroma Room.
I'm gonna have to give him up.
Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?
Okay. You know that I-I have to go.
Ehh, I was just, I was just thinking about your father.
What? I can't cancel on Joan!
What do you want to do now? Huh? You wanna go get a drink?
I'm sweeping...
Judy, Judy, relax, this is our little harmonica we're talking about. We taught her well. Ten percent of your paycheck, where does it go?
Yeah, yeah.
Hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about?
Thanks you guys, I really appreciate this. All right, I'm gonna get packing again. Man, I've been moving around so much I'm beginning to feel like a nomad.
No! But we-we didn't have...sex-uh, did we? I mean, I don't remember much about last night, it was such a blur.
59 seconds. Quartz, ha.
How 'bout instead you, go get changed! You, give him back his underwear! I'm gonna go get a cab, and I want everyone down stairs in two minutes! Monica!
So we should probably get going soon.
Laugh all you want but uh, she actually left me a message saying she'd like to go out again.
And that's what's gonna kill me. I'm allergic to kiwi.
Oh, no! No!
What code?
I don't know, I'm one sorry polentologist. All right Joey, we get it. I'm sorry.
That's right, and that's why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end.
Oh, come on!
Yeah.
I'll have whatever Christine is having.
You see this, this is a person who is ready to go. Phoebe you, oh, you are my star.
Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...
No, no, no just do it. Go in there and pick something out so we can go.
Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y'know? You, you were great. ...Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for, uh, something grape?
Marcel! Where are you going with that disc?
Well then, what is it?!
I'm gonna go get him! Okay, I am going back in!
Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me?
I don't know Rachel, why?
How could you have told her?
Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she'd have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy.
Come on.
Well, we didn't have freedom here until 1776, either so...
So umm, any word from Susan?
No. No.
That's, that's, that's a big candy bar. I had the most amazing time with you.
What's going on?
Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in college. I mean that's-that's when I really found my sound.
What's going on?
Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?
Yeah, I'm gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.
Hey, they're going to the gym together! Two women! Stretching! Y'know they-they take a steam together! Things get a little playful-didn't you see Personal Best?
You think?! God, I, ah, I'm in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachel's all like, 'I love you and, and let's work on this.' And all I can think about is, 'What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?' when I tell her what I did.
What?
A little.
What? What? Was that a joke? 'Cause it's mean.
OK, fine, well I'm not gonna watch, alright.
And she just gave you this?
Yep! Yeah, see this says D-13, and uh...
Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts. A briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.
And I too am just a love machine.
Oh.
Oh my God! Of course, of course. Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment? Umm, do you know each other's hometowns? Why don't you... Wh-what's going on?
This couch, is cut in half! I would like to exchange it for one that is not cut in half!
Monica had such a crush on him. Yeah, she used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed.
Hey. Rachel, I-I-I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now and I really, I just have to get it out.
Thanks.
Yeah? How much?
No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.
Nope.
Then how do you explain the toe ring?!
Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the- -the bus stop... I'm fine.
Okay... okay, maybe I will...
Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.
That bitch!
Come on, don't do this.
All yours.
I see. So what do you propose to do?
Now, we'll see.
Oh, thank God!
Ohh.
Monica. Whaddya think?
At the vet.
It was soo not an accident. She saw I was about to tag her, so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running.
Umm, no. No.
Hey, Pheebs!
Okay, fine!
God that is the most beautiful engagement ring ever!
So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?
Oh. Listen, have you ever been uh, you know, foolin' around with a girl and uh, she started laughin'?
Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place.
Hey!
All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application.
Fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yoghurt, or something..
What are you guys doing later?
Oh, wake up!
Hey.
Yeah?
Ewwww!!
Why?!
Yeah!
Chandler! Chandler!
Well yeah, but she doesn't know that. I mean, the last time she saw you-you would've turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling.
Julie. Julie. That. Oh God. Julie, right. OK, I need to lie down. No, ya know, I'm gonna stand. I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna walk, I'm walkin' and I am standing. OK so you uh, and now wha... and now, now, now you're over me?
OK, I'm gonna go say goodbye to the guys.
Well, of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming, that's not enough. Look, I studying kara-tay for a long time, and there's a concept you should really be familiar with. It's what the Japanese call unagi.
Yeah.
'Cause otherwise they'd have to call it the room room.
Hi. I understand you had a little talk with Emily.
Ok, ok look, see, the thing is we're, we're not gonna fight you guys.
You don't have to shout everything.
Hey.
Well she should, it was taken ten years ago!
Ow! Ow! Okay, okay, fine, fine! All right, you wanna win by cheating, go ahead, all right. Phoebe the touchdown does count, you win.
You really didn't know?
Well, the stuff I just mentioned.
....and....
So uh, what did you tell them about me?
Yes, very nice Rachel.
It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff.
Oh my god.
Carol our sex life is-it's just not working...
Meth-methane smells...
But-but Cailin, he definitely will scream.
Yeah, okay, Scott!
Why, why, why can't you stand me being here? I don't, I, we're just, ya know, we're just havin' fun.
Rach, what uh, what are you doing here?
What is that?
This year was supposed to be great! But, it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!
Hey, it's my list.
Guess what?
Geez! Are you ready?
Hey!
Don't be scared, I-I know it sounds crazy and-and people will say it's too soon, but just-just think, think how great it will be.
What's a koondis?
Okay.
Everyday I am gonna do one thing that I haven't done before. That my friends is my New Year's resolution.
....and 12, 22, 18, four... What?
No, not a problem.
Thank you.
Okay, this is getting a little crazy. I mean, I'm-I'm sure it would be amazing but I...gotta say I really-really don't think it would be a good idea. Y'know? I really, really...don't.
Hey Pheebs, how's it going?
Oh my God!
D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?
Yours, I just got 43 points for 'KIDNEY'.
What?
Hey Joey! Great stuff huh?
All right, keep going. We are phasing the accent out, phasing it out. So without out re-testing the results in the laboratory the team would never have identified the initial errors in their carbon dating analysis . Were there any questions at this point? Yes.
What?
Hey! Hi Bonnie!
Hey!
We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!
What?! The guys against the girls? See, that's ridiculous Monica, because I'm only down by three touchdowns.
Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?
Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway.
Correct. Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl's breast?
What big thing?
Although I was married to her.
No, I just think Monica was that fat.
Try the bottom one.
It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! It's, it's apples and oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go.
Hi.
You remember Janice, right?
What? Oh, okay. Wait here.
Yep! That's hilarious!
I don't know. It's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I, I definitely don't care about my sandwich.
...so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles.
Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy!
You like it?
'Cause Carol's a lesbian. And, and I'm not one. And apparently it's not a mix and match situation.
So?
Hi.
What?
Oh, I thought you guys had just been on like four dates, I didn't realise that had become anything, yet.
So that's two of my wives.
Us too.
Uh, nothing, nothing's with him. Enjoy your coffee.
Oh no! It could be better, but it's gonna be okay, right?
Ok.
What are you doing?
No! No, I won't! I'll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now. The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh, Murderer Guy, and-and, Geologists.
What's wrong with this year?
Ok.
All right, we're gonna play.
Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.
We're looking into it.
Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo.
Sure.
What?!
Real magic does exist.
Just go for it Chandler.
Dad, we-we can't believe you're selling the house.
Okay, you go grab it!
Yeah.
I have to say Tupolo Honey by Van Morrison.
No, but, your-your mad.
Well, Ben would be there.
Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years.
Why-why would I care about that?
Sorry, I'm sorry. Close, close, close...
Like uh y'know like this! This! She-she could've made this!
Marcel is an illegal exotic animal. I'm not allowed to have him in the city. If they find him, they'll take him away from me.
Hey!
Joey!
I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I hope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice. What you're-you're not mad?
Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I mean I actuallyI-I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that.
I hear ya.
I can't believe that didn't work!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown didn't count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose breaking.
In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week.
This is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television.
The small one.
Oh my God.
Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.
Because it's a special hat. See he bought it 'cause he was feeling really down one day so he got the hat to cheer himself up, ya know. Now Chandler...
Huh?
Yeah that-that, doesn't look right.
Yeah!
Come on! Come on. Come on.
Uh Joey, that's just the minumum amount due, that's your total due.
Hey.
Hi.
Yes, yes of course, what-what would this be regarding?
No, no, no, this weekend guys!
Yeah, you didn't get one.
Oh God!
I didn't get the annulment.
Well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings.
Yeah, she's got to go back to London. But you know what? I've been prepared for this from the start. We both knew we had two weeks together, and that's it. Y'know.
I can't believe this!!
Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone.
Please, he refers to me as 'wethead'.
Yeah. And you should hold out for something bigger. I can't tell you how much respect I have for you not going to that stupid cab driver audition.
Save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. The clock is ticking. We have no time, and we are losing, we are losing to girls.
Ohh, you can see them, huh?
Why does Joanna need two assistants, how, how lazy is she?
Hey. When you guys were kids and you played Happy Days, who were you? I was always Richie.
I-I had to show Chandler something?
Okay. What ah, what is the matter with you? What's going on?
Okay, I'm sorry, this is insane! I-I-I'm not addicted to heroin, I'm not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything! Look, I'll consummate this marriage right here, right now!
No, but it is frowned upon.
Y'know what? I-I-I... I-I have had enough of this! Y'know, I-I-I care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing but respect! So if-if you've got a problem with me, frankly...
We're rehearsing a Greek play.
You couldn't let me have her, could ya?!
I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten.
Huh.
Hi.
Uh.... bean! Bean!
No, four minutes ago you had a half hour, we have to be out the door at twenty to eight.
If the place you are referring too is being in love, then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place!
What? That's great. That is great. What did we just finish talking about Ben?!
Thank you!
And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at all the time isn't moving.
what's up, Dad?
Well I, that's the thing, I don't know! I mean, whenever I brought it up with her she said, "This is so fantastic! Why do we have to talk about the future? Let's just enjoy..."
What's up with the greed Joe?
Of course! It all adds up! I mean you you're obsessed with her. It's always, "Ross, what are you gonna do about Rachel?" "Ross, why-why are you moving in with Rachel?" "When are you gonna confess your secret marriage to Rachel?" You want her!
C'mon, seriously, Joey, what's the part?
Joey's not going.
Oh, thanks. Yeah, I really thought we'd be able to make it work, but uh, I guess it just wasn't meant to be.
I had a problem.
Let me hold him for a sec. There. Huh? There we are.
Well I don't know umm, what if we were too tie each other up? Umm, some people eat stuff off one another. Nah! Umm, y'know we-we could try dirty talk? Umm, we could, we could have a threesome.
That's right, you're gonna spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's, aren't you.
15 more seconds, 14, 13, 12...
You like it right?
Oh, oh, I'm, I'm, I'm sorry sweetie, I was just trying to ah, I'm dialing another number.
How come it's not mixing with the water?
Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...Susan: Come in.
What? What? What?!
...run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with...
No way!
No, because she hasn't come home yet. And she hasn't been home all night! She's obviously staying with that other guy, and I'm the stupid moron who spent the whole night outside her apartment!
Paolo, I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I say...
Okay! Okay! Fine, I'll stop! No teaching, okay? We'll just watch the pretty light streaking across the sky. Okay? Who's official name is Bapstein-King.
Nono, that would be me again.
She's not- past, she's present, she's back.
Pretty cool, huh?
Thank you!
So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I'm already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.
Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten Island.
Sorry.
No, um, see 'cause that, that is, that is the staging area. If you go in there, it'll ruin the whole illusion of the party. Yeah, I think you take your scotch back in there and I will get your cigarettes for you sir.
Yeah.
One-Mississippi, two-Mississippi, switch! Switch! Switch!!
Fine, fine, Rachel your with Monica, Joey you're with me.
Y'know of-officer I uh...I had the weirdest dream last night...
No, not this time. So... what'd you have?
How, how, um how can you not be going?
Okay, here I go.
Hey now! That was an accident, okay.
No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade.
That's not what this is about okay? I-I am a sports car enthusiast. I have always been into cars.
Okay. Wow! This is going so well. Did you see us? Did you see?
In your mouth?!
Stay away!
Come on you guys, it's no big deal!
Ugh.
She's talking.
So uhh, you ready?
So uh, have a great time down there.
Come on. All right, here we go. All right?
And, I love you!!
No! And somehow, we ended up with a joint checking account.
Because It's The Highest. Situation No.1 You're with Monica, the wedding is about to start when Monica gets cold feet. Go!
And! Break!!
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
Fine.
Shut-out!!
Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?
Fifteen.
Okay, she can't go.
What?
Beautiful!
All right, here's the ring.
Yeah, okay.
Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.
Animal sex, animal sex? So what're you saying, I mean, you're saying that like, there's nothing between us animal at all. I mean there's not even like, uhm, a little animal, not even, not even like, like chipmunk sex?
Oh, yeah I know, I know, it's a lot of boxes, but again I really appreciate you guys letting me stay here.
Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?
Yeah, yeah, I was watching. Umm, hey, a couple of questions though. Umm, about that-that-that last move where the woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next?
And! We should keep all the stuff uh, we told each other secret from everybody else.
Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.
Hey.
Okay, Monica. Mon, uh what-what you just saw...
Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.
Okay. Umm, for a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
Yeah, it really was!
Good call!
It's an empty apartment.
I don't know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then.
Have a good time. Ok, Ben.
What? Great, now I'm having a baby.
Woah.
Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.
Hey, how are you holding up?
All right, I gotta go. I'm taking Ben to the park.
You okay?
Bunny!
Yeah, I think she looks good.
Ahh, whoo-hoo!!
Me? No.
Phoebe! You and I have never played chess!
Yep!
Well w-w-w-w-wait, w-wait, wait, wait a minute! I mean a couple of stupid boxes get wet and she gets a Porsche?!
It's all right! Everything's gonna be all right.
What?
Just-just so you know I was a freshman and she was a senior. So it wasn't as bad as-as...
I did not freak out.
...and these come in the shapes of your favourite Christmas characters, Santa, Rudolph, and Baby Jesus.
Who needs a lease when it's family!
Really?
Please.
Uh-oh...
Monica and I have a grandmother who died, you both went to her funeral, name that grandmother!
Hey!
Mon?
Yeah, it's really 6:00 tomorrow night our time.
A wandering?
On behalf of everyone, I'd just like to say behuh.
Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.
Rachel!! Wow! You, uh, you look, wow!
OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah...
What? Ow!
All right then.
Ooh, I, I'm so sick of missing stuff. Ya know, I want him for more than, than a day, I want him for a whole weekend. No listen , I mean, I feel like-
Listen, I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom...
Well, well I am married. Even though I haven't spoken to my wife since the wedding.
Um, yeah.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! Now remember what we talked about, you gotta be strong.
Okay, okay, we'll just get everyone to act like they like it. That-that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to Sweet Potatoe Pie!
No.
Yeah! Got it!
Wow, did not know that! May I say how lovely you look today?
And what did he ask you not to call him?
Yeah, losers talk!
No you do-y'know what, you're not gonna suck me into this.
Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
Oh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort of happen around you. I mean, you're off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totally oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings...
Okay Phoebe, I guess you're next although I really don't see the point.
OK, what's the longest you've been in the relationship before ha, have, having the sex?
Who isn't?
How did you know she would buy scotch tape?
No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. Do you guys know who Carl is?
No! No! No!
Then be supportive like a guy.
Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.
Okay, there's this guy, Warren, from the museum and he's going on a dig for like two years and he's got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh, you interested?
Looks like a fun gang.
Obviously not to Joey.
Cigarettes?!!
What are you doing?
Save it.
Hey, remember when I had a monkey?
You're over me?
She's not here yet. She's not here. She's having my baby and she's not here.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
Come on, tell me.
You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called "a globe?" Hmm?
Because there are naked ladies there.
I like this song.
No, no, that-that, that's all right. Umm, I'm just glad you called.
Oh. How do you uh, ya know, keep it so neat?
Oh, aaaah!
Oh, sorry we didn't know.
What?
Really?
Emily.
All right, see you later.
What are you kidding? It's Batman's tux!!
What are you talking about?
Okay, do-do you have a good grip?
You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.
All right, I'll do it.
I love you.
Hey.
I could, yeah, I can do that.
She already lives in London.
But it absolutely didn't. It didn't!! It didn't!!
It's okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time, y'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could.
Well, I guess that's it.
She doesn't know which one of us she wants, me or this Colin guy.
Hey Mon!
That is so good! Do it again!
Y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what I do, I wonder how many people would go see a movie called, Jurassic Parka.
2 hours, 27 minutes.
Hello!
High collar and baggy pants say I'm a pro.
All right.
If like the four of us could all y'know, hang out together. Uh, in fact Emily's coming into town this weekend, why don't you say we all have dinner? Say, Sunday night?
Wooooooo, hehehe. Hey, ahh, you don't feel like you're gonna throw up, do ya?
I've been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don't, don't you think we can work on this?
Could ya just, could ya just lay off, please? All right? My life is an embarrassment! I should go live under somebody's stairs!
Right?
Well, aren't you forgetin' something? What, what, what is uh, what is that guy's name? Dad!
What? No! No! I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe-Ooh, although I did get some great Pottery Barn sheets!
That's right.
Joey, it's Ross! I need some help!
No! For all I know, she's trying to find me but couldn't because I kept moving around. No, from now on, I'm staying in one place. Right here.
Yeah, little change in plans. Ahh, we're gonna break-up instead.
Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!
Hey there little fella! Hey, uh-hey, why don't we get some shoes on ya, huh? Hey, why don't you show dad how you can put your shoes on, in your room! Yay!!
A loser you did it with 298 times!
Yes!
Yeah, just... just Nana stuff.
Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? I'm fine, I'm fine.
200 at least.
No!
The way he makes me feel about myself.
Okay. Well, you be careful.
Uh-huh.
I don't want to do that.
Okay.
I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.
Hey uh, this is Elizabeth.
You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were so close Phoebe!
Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the way they were.
Joey, uh- OMnipotent.
Come on.
It's a great class.
Ohhh! Kids!
Yeah!
Hey, what's going on?
All right! I want my key back!
Oh wow! I mean, wow! I mean, I-I-I think she's cute but I-I would never have thought of going out with her, never!
Hey!
Look, can, can you do something for me?
Oh damn!
Oh yeah, she's-she's amazing. And-and she's so much fun. And! Y'know what? When I'm with her, I'm fun! I even signed up for helicopter classes. She's leaving in two days, I don't have to do it.
Yeah, he's head of the department.
Y'know what? Fine! Get attacked! I don't even care!
Oh.
I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we can't date. It's against the rules. It's forbidden.
Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us.
Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?
...everyone, this is Chandler!
Okay, is everybody clear? We're gonna pick it up...and move it. Now all we need is teamwork, okay? We're gonna lift the car...and slide it out. Lift and slide!
She was...
Great. Great.
Umm, it's Cutie McPretty.
You've got to help me my monkey swallowed a 'K'!
No, there is no way he was a velociraptor. No Tony, look at the cranial ridge, OK. If Dino was a velociraptor, he would have eaten the Flintstones. Yeah, yeah. Oh, were you takin' a nap?
Crazy.
Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to.
Well if it doesn't matter to her, it doesn't matter to me! Still not yelling!
Did I, did I even treat?
Yeah! Good for you Joe!
Oh just say it Kyle!
It was pretty funny when I, when I hid it for a while, huh? Anyway, umm, I-I am worried about that bathing suit, not because it's revealing which I'm fine with, no I'm concerned about your health, sun exposure.
I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.
Well umm, I've been doing a lot more of my kara-tay.
Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along.
Come on, Chandler.
Hey! It's starting to snow.
That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Who did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'.
I feel great. I feel- great, I fleel great.
Yeah, that's the one. Listen, I don't want to hurt her.
Oh, thanks, thanks. So Monica tells me that uh, you don't want to play anymore because me and y'know my talent. Is that true?
What, so this guy is helping you for no apparent reason?
I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do stand up and shout 'Hey, Rachel, your butt is showing!'
I tired attacking two women, did not work.
Order a pizza like, 'I forgive you?'
Hi!
Hey!
Cool! Dad! My report cards! Hey, check this out dad, Math, A. Science, A. History, A. Gym... Oooh, my rock polisher!
That little naked guy would be me.
What?
That is so made up!
I'm hurt.
Are you angry at me because I said your handwriting is childlike?
Wow!
So, you-you think I should go ahead and take this place?
What?
Who gets whom. I don't know why I do that.
Hey, where's Chandler?
I guess it could.
Yes, yes, that's right...
Hey does anyone have any gum?
Oh yeah, yeah, sure. Absolutely.
What? Oh! I gotta tell you, I-I wasn't expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasn't expecting to like anyone right now, but she's really terrific.
Hey, Joey. You wanna open the window?
Well I-I-I don't care how hot it is it's-it's uh, it's wrong.
No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batman's tux!
I know.
I'm sorry. But ah, hey, oh, somebody's off the phone, how 'bout a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again.
Oh, tell me, tell me, is everything, uhh....?
Well, uh, for your information, there's a woman at the museum, who's curator of moths and other... uh... winged things... who's, uh, let it be known that she is drawn to me much like a... well, you know. But so far I've been keeping her at bay, but, uh, if this is the deal...
Oh God, here we go!
That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!
Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other.
I know.
Okay, we'll be right in. So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?
When Monica was a little girl, I remember that--Ooh!! Ow! Very good!
Let me see! Show them!
Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you?
It was just a kiss.
Hi.
Uh Mr. Morse, can I speak to you for a moment?
Rachel...
I didn't order lemonade.
What happened?
No, I'm genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn't work out. Look, Rach, I want only good things for you.
Um.... no. See, I might've had feelings for her at one timenot any more. I justI...
Okay, you're in bed. She's over on your side, cuddling. Now you wait for her to drift off, and then you hug her and roll her back over to her side of the bed. And then you rollll a-way. Hug for her! Roll for you.
I'll tell you what Mon, I'll give you the first box for free.
Yeah!!!
Oh yes, the weenie from Torrini.
Well...
All right, did you just say all right?
Hey!
Well, we won't wanna raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh, Scarsdale.
Right. No biggie. Stay loose.
Awww.
Wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as Georgio.
Dude, we were good!
What?
Pheebs? What, why are you whispering?
She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.
Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did.
Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger?
Yeah!
Alright, alright, here's the chance. Monica give him cash, Rachel give him your earrings. Something, now, anything.
I'm asking you to do me a favor.
And shame on you! You should know better, Joey needs to work. Now come on!
Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you don't, uh, you don't believe in evolution?
That's a little clearer.
Hey-hey, it's valid okay? And I'm not the only one who thinks so, Monica agrees with me.
Hey Chandler, there's a party tomorrow, you'll feel better then.
No, no it's, um, it's not you, um, it's um, it's
Okay, I'm the baby.
Alright, now, you sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they didn't look happy...
All right. All right, I'll do it.
A little bit.
Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal.
Nuh-uh.
That was 14 hours ago.
Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.
Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask.
Joey, had an imaginary childhood friend. His name was?
You don't, you don't know what your wearing?
Oh, thank you, thanks. So uh, how was your night last night?
My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.
It really was.
Wha, uhh, what?
Yeah?
Yes, yes it is. In prison!
I'm hurt! I'm actually hurt, that you would think that I would send you any of those things out of any thing other than love. Hurt! Hurt!
You guys, you know what, you know what, it doesn't matter, because you both have to go get dressed before the big vain in my head pops. So..
Hey, I don't know what to tell you guys that's the doll he chose.
What do you mean? Nothing happened! I had to get out of there.
Oh no! An asteroid!
Well, last weekend...
Hi Jill!
Yeah, like I could lose it.
Oh, thanks. Oh, you're the best.
Hey! Everyone.
Okay.
Where in Cuba?
Yeah, it is.
Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you. When you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo.
Hey!
I got itI'm getting it!
My God.
Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. Good.
I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something.
Me too!
Hi! Sorry I'm late. Were you sleeping?
Okay. Well, apparently Chandler's angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago.
I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus. Huh?
Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go.
Ahh, no, I'm good.
Sorry.
Yeah, I recognize the ankles!
That's crap!! Sister Brown Bird. Good going.
No.
Hey, you guys! Guess what?
E-except, except that what?
Okay, y'know what, let's just cut to the chase here. Okay? Heidi, which of my boys do you like?
Oh, wait! Wait! Don't you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe you'll get that job!
I-I, did that for you.
What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.
That's not advice!
There you go.
Really?
We already knew that!
Isabella Rosselini.
Umm, uh, I was just telling the guys...
Yeah, but don't you think....
You're right, I'm sorry. Will you marry me?
Oh! That's nice.
Hi!
Monica, I'm cutting you off.
Hello.
Rach, come on, look, I know how you must feel.
'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say "When are you gonna grow up and realise I am your mom?"
Yeah, see, we-we-we have to stop across the hall, because it's my sister. But, uh, uh y'know actually, growing up with a sister was nice because it really helped me understand women. Yeah, you-you should tell your friends that.
I'm calling Mom.
Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clock's a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes. Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes? Twice?
Jasmine?
Fine, I'm mentally unstable.
And that's not against your oath?!
Okay!
That's great! Are you happy now? Look what you did with your funny, funny form!
Okay, okay. Uh, well uh, Rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings in his ear.
Hey!
Hey, what's goin' on?
What, what.
Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck?
Great! Great! You're making the bike very happy.
You wanna watch Laverne y Shirley?
Okay, now hold on. Joey, why, why can't you just wear the underwear you're wearing now?
That's it? That's all you wrote? You're the worst writer in the whole world.
Okay, you don't have to stop, I'm invisible, I'm not here.
Phoebe that's not true.
Okay, break-up's still on!
Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyone's name, so I-I kinda came up with nicknames. Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.
I'm not proving anything. Okay, I'm done listening to you. If I hadn't let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never would've put my fist through the wall!
Yes, yes it is. It's uh... Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!
Okay.
I do not have feelings for Rachel! Okay?!
Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.
Hey.
If you wanna put a label on it.
Hello, Susan. Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...?
Yeah! They're putting together this panel to talk about these fossils they just found in Peru and The Discovery Channel's gonna film it!
Yeah, well, m-maybe you're right.
Uhh, okay, it's uh, Emily and I, we decided to uh, to get married.
Yeah! Se vice?
Oh that's nice.
Ehh, I don't, I don't think so. She's already talked about y'know, dating other guys.
Hey.
It's nothing, I just gave her a hug.
And if I remember correctly, Ray Ban was the official sponsor of World War I!
Oh my God. Oh my God! And you're-you're...you're not freaking out?
Oh my God, what happened?
You're wrong.
That uh, that was pretty funny. Wasn't it?
You're welcome.
Okay!
Ah, we'll all go. Come on.
What?!
Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin' guy.
Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now.
To wear in front of people?
Aww, come on.
No, Rach, no. I don't, I don't, I don't have to think about it, in fact, I've decided, I've decided that, that it.......does.
Hi.
And is a hum, kinda like a scruddle?
Well, what is she goes down and-and sleeps with a bunch of guys?
You got a job?
Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about the night of five times?
Hi.
Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'Cause I-I got nothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do. Okay then. Here we go. Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again? Ask again later. Later is not good enough. Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!
Okay dad.
No, sorry I don't. Tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life? What if it doesn't come out right Phoebe? Then it's like, I don't know, havin' a bad hair cut all the time. Why's everyone staring at me?
Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!
Look at you two, bonding, making us late for the airport so...
HEY, SHE'S FAST!! OKAY?!! Oh! You-you think you can be beat me? Let's go! Outside!!
Yeah, that'd be cool!
I gotta go make a fake Ben.
Dad?
Go Joe!!!
Mm-hmm..
Well, actually it's been great. She's 20 so she's not looking for anything too serious, which is perfect for me right now.
Ah, we're out. I sold them all.
Hey Pheebs, what 'cha reading? Pheebs? Hello? Phoebe? Phoe-Phoebe! Come on!
Pheebs, come on, you didn't kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist. It's, it's, it's just ah, a coincidence.
Hmm.
You're welcome, Ben. Merry Christmas, ooh, and Happy Hanukkah!
With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa!
Really?
What?
Althea is correct.
Um, see, but that's not the final draft.
Oh great! What, you brought Joey?
When we first met her, she was soaking, her feet were wet! Who wouldn't be miserable? I'm telling you when I got her into a dry pair of shoes, she was a totally different person.
No. I... I wanted to be with you. I don't know, I feel like lately, I feel like you're slipping away from me, y'know. With this new job, and all these new people, and you've got this whole other life going on. I-I-I know it's dumb, but I hate that I'm not a part of it.
Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go?
Bye Ryan.
Sure. Why not?
I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...
Of course I am! Okay, let's go godfather.
Look, I'm sorry, I thought it looked pretty.
No. no.
Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!
The Geller Cup.
Oh, but I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit! I've been waiting like a year for this.
How'd the callback go?
Whoa-whoa-whoa!
Please! Are you kidding? I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody nose-I mean I-I'm not proud of it but, I really am. And it's all because of you, wonderful, amazing you.
No, I-I got really hot in my leather pants so I took them off but they must have shrunk from the-the sweat or-or-or my legs expanded from the heat. Look, I-I can't put them back on. I can't!
Go, go, go!
Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing.
Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices.
I don't see why not.
Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture.
Come on, man! Just-just take the sweats off. Okay? Just take 'em off and we'll have some fun.
Hey Pheebs, what's going on?
Oh, hey hey hey, ho ho ho, hello, guy who doesn't want to know, standing right here!
I...Reorganized The Fridge. See, Bottom Shelf: Meats And Dairy. And Top Shelf expired products.
Sweep, sweep....
Hey!
What a weird way to kick me when I'm down.
Okay, first of all, I don't play with cheaters, and second of all, you know I had swollen glands!!
Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?
All right look, I-I realize it upsets you.
No.
Uh... Oh hey, do you, uh ...do you have any, um, Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?
Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.
I know, I wasn't finished. But don't worry! We're gonna go down the fire escape!!
Come here, Marcel. Sit here.
'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..?
It's not that easy, there's still a lot of relationship stuff.
Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?
Quack, quack..
Turn.
Um, Monica and I aren't supposed to play football.
Yeah, I have a question. When is this gonna air?
Y'know what...
Yeah, yeah, it'll be great! You can, you can lay on the beach and I can cry over my failed marriage. See-see how I make jokes?
You're welcome for a delicious dinner.
So, listen guys, are we uh, are we ok here?
What happened you guys?
Dude, you are sick.
I think it's insane.
Get out!
So let's decide on the spending limit...
Oh, right!
Well maybe she wouldn't have to be selfish in bed if someone else knew where everything was!
Listen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I... we're kind of a thing.
Yeah.
No, no, don't. Why don't we?
Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.
I know what you mean, I've always wondered how different my life would be if-if I'd never gotten divorced.
I'm fine! I saw a psychiatrist at work today.
That's a good point.
What?!
Mon, speaking of which, dad says he knows someone you can call for an interview.
I prefer not to answer that right now, I'm still carrying a little holiday weight.
Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?
Sure, what do you got?
Alright, I want my monkey.
Yeah, it was, but...I get home, ok, and I see Julie's saline solution on my night table. And I'm thinking to myself, oh my god, what the hell am I doing? I mean, here I am, I am with Julie, this incredible, great woman, who I care about and who cares about me, and I'm like, what, am I just gonna throw all that away?
Hey!
This is my wedding.
Eh?
I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.
Yeah.
Hey!
You should get some sleep.
Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.
You're sure? Nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything?
I can't believe no one believes me!
I want to go to the bathroom.
Oh yeah!
Yeah, I'm-I'm sure. Yeah, get out of here before I change my mind.
The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...
Who's Chip?
I think Chandler's gone.
Why not?
'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?
What's the part, Anti-man?
No, they're not.
Yeah. What do you think.
Okay, I got us a court date for tomorrow at 2:00 and I picked up all the forms. I'll take care of everything.
Ohh. . . Thanks Rach, goodnight.
What? What? What?! You guys knew? You all knew and you didn't tell me?!!
Oh, that's great, that is great!
Okay, Elizabeth Hurely....
I don't know.
What? Sophie, does she have ten minutes?
There are naked ladies there too.
I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.
Green. To the green.
'Cause there's time to make up for that. We can do stuff together. You always wanted to go to that Colonial Williamsburg. How 'bout we do that?
Yes.
No. I am not putting on makeup.
Yeah?
Okay.
Look I told you...
Uhhhh... Joey cried last night.
Look I-I don't know what's going on with you and your husband and what is hopefully an adult dog walker, look can I just say not all men are like that.
Hmm.
Kristen, hi. Are you uh, new to the area, 'cause if you are...I'd love to show you around sometime.
Yes. Yes! Please, come in.
Hey hey, we'll be fine. We're just gonna need a little time.
Well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back.
Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by "bye!"
Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even look like now.
Rachel. Hey.
No!
I'm telling you, just a little bit at a time.
Okay, I...
Oh you guys are not gonna believe what happened.
What am I doing?
You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
I'm sorry, I've got plans with my sister.
Hey umm, was-was Monica here?
Oh, who cares?
This is beautiful!
Looks to me like he's the one getting the job.
Well it's really. . . sexy. I wouldn't have thought it would be but. . . wow.
Oh!
You don't understand! Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip with her! Is that taking it slow?! No, I'm not ready for this! Okay? What-what do I tell her?
Ohh!
No!
Yeah. You see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Her secret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; I call it the Moist Maker. Anyway, I-I put my sandwich in the fridge over here...
Hans...Hans...Yo evil twin.
Hey, Paulo. What are you doing here?
Oh, it was, nah, well....
I think, sub-consciously...
I, uh, I'll go see.
All right!
Mon.
I was kinda, supposed to be on TV tonight for The Discovery Channel.
Wh-what's up?
Chandler?! You brought Chandler?! The next best thing would be Monica!
You think?
Yes. Yes. Yes.
Come on!
Well, I called over there and it turns out Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it himself and he's already had like a hundred applicants.
A tattoo? Why, why would you want to do that? Hi.
Yeah?
Gimme back my monkey.
Oh you guys, I-I really think just one of us should go out there so she's not overwhelmed...
Okay, well, we'll call the company that sent her!
Really. It's always been you, Rach.
How you doing?
Uh, before we do uh, are any of Joey's special romance magazines in there?
My God. Rachel! Your here. I can't believe it. What happen? Why are you here?
No. They swoop in and steal your jackpot.
Sure! Ooh-ooh, what about this?
Wow! It actually is in the handbook. I can't date you or have a hot plate in my office. I can't believe we have to stop seeing each other.
Yeah.
I had to talk loud because the movie was loud!
I can't believe you let George Michael slap you.
I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?
Hey man.
Huh.
Everybody smile.
Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, uh, do you...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent.
What?
Women really want this?
But, um... I don't think that's going to be you.
Are you intrigued?
And the place looks so nice!
How's my little boy?
Now, hold on! Hold on! Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I'm gonna be at that airport and I hope that she'll be there too! Oh yeah, I said Rachel's name, but it didn't mean anything, Okay? She's-she's just a friend and that's all! That's all! Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please, promise me that you'll tell her that.
Look, don't worry. Okay? You're gonna be fine.
Great, how did it go?
Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?
And that is why we cannot see each other anymore.
Not, not, not every night. You know, and... and it's not like I didn't try, Rachel, but things got in the way, y'know? Like, like Italian guys or ex-fiances or, or, or Italian guys.
Yes. Yes. Just here and there .
That's easy for you to say, you found one already.
That's right Lydia, Elizabeth here is a student and uh, we're dating. And you may frown upon that, but we're not gonna hide it anymore.
Hey, I might!
Yeah, right!
Yes! My baby's finally free!
Emily? Emily? I'm coming in.
You want me to take some girl I've never met to the opera so you can go to a club and flirt with some guy, hmm, that-that is a toughie.
Gandolf the wizard. Hello! Didn't you read Lord of the Rings in high school?
Are you kidding?!
Now, hold on! Hold on! Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I'm gonna be at that airport and I hope that she'll be there too! Oh yeah, I said Rachel's name, but it didn't mean anything, Okay? She's-she's just a friend and that's all! That's all! Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please, promise me that you'll tell her that.
Oh really? What uh, what does he want with her?
No. I'm saying it's now.
So you don't wanna go to Williamsburg?
But, you, you don't want to seem too pushy.
Rach, uh, you still looking for a place?
Look uh, if we're gonna do this...
Listen man, uh, I'm sorry the audition didn't go so well.
What, what's that?
Oh, just hold on a second. I'm watching this rugby thing on ESPN. I don't know what the big deal is. I'm man enough to play this sport.
Hey, come on in.
You know, I might have expected this of you Phoebe, but Ryan, you're a military man.
Hello.
What?
G-gift? The thing's not the gift?
Ok, ok, here we go. Ok, where am I talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but...
Yeah. You can help me get my furniture back from Gunther.
All right. Y'know what? We don't have to go downstairs! We can bring Vegas up to us! All right, come on, come on, we'll play some blackjack. Here we go. 13.
Seven.
Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-what's wrong with Monica and Chandler?
Multiple orgasms!
Damn! I can't believe I took her off my list.
Look, check this out. Is it a coffee table, is it a panther? There's no need to decide.
So you were right?
No but, no but.
Yeah, take your time.
Not for tonight. Not for tonight! Wh-what, what, what, are you doing?
Hey, how's it going?
Well, you just...
Oh hi! Ross Geller. And this is my friend Phoebe.
Of course.
Chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl!
Thanks? But I have plans; Elizabeth and I are going out of town.
Tho?
Die Hard!!!!!!
Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son.
Monica?
Umm, jealous!
Oh! Oh-oh, the band's ready! Well, I-I-we gotta do what the band says-I don't care about the stupid band!!
Bye-bye!
No one got me an engagement present.
Hey, you guys.
Okay.
Sure, what's up?
Right. Ohh! You-you want me to be your backup.
The head, the head. You gotta...
That's a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?
What-what do you mean?
She's your cousin. She's your cousin! If she knew what was going on in your head she'd think you were sick! Or would she? Let's back up a second. She was the one who suggested opening a bottle of wine. She was the one who turned down the lights. She was the one that wanted to rent Logan's Run, the sexiest movie ever. Oh, I know that look. Forget it. I want it. She wants it. I'm going in.
Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a dream I had- but, phew.
I think this is it. I don't know, maybe we should keep looking.
Pheebs, I think she's great. Okay? We're going out again.
Yeah, but I'm your brother. We're family. That's the most important thing in the world.
Hey, I just realized we kinda let some stuff up in the air...
That-that-that's all right, no honey, you take your time sweetie. I'll be right out here. She's just fixing her makeup.
No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok? Where does that leave me?
Ow!!
Yeah. And did you, did you pack that bathing suit?
You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...
Bumpy?
Na-huh.
Yeah, well, he's a baby not a bomb.
Oh. Oh, that's right. So-so you did see me that day because it seemed like you didn't.
I'm a professor here uh, Ross...Geller.
Uh-huh.
Hey!
Look at that, they won't even turn their heads.
What?
Can I have everyone's attention please? I'm uh; I'm Ross Geller.
Yeah.
No no no, go-
Yeah.
Yeah, okay.
To London! Come to London. Please? It'll mean so much to me.
What you don't think I'd go up to her?
Not the first two, but the second two- woooo! ...I love you guys. You guys are the greatest. I love my sister , I love Pheebs...
I'm gonna be on TV!!
Umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great. 'Cause you know love lasts forever, y'know. Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so Rachel and I broke up.
Yeah. Look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her.
Hey guys!
I know it is pretty unbelievaaaaah.
I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
I don't know.
Tough noogies, we're watching Predators of the Serengetti.
'Why don't you call him?!' Well, thank you very much! Y'know now he is going to prep her, y'know prep her, as in what you do when you surgically remove the boyfriend!
Okay, look, yesterday I would've even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that-that has got to mean something!
You got it.
Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked to Emily...
My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-
What? That's like insanely easy!
Rach! Rach!
Didn't you spend last night at Joey's?
I didn't know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn't finish the whole letter!
Shhhh!
Ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym.
Hey.
His daughter was hot.
What's going on, is... uh, Bobby drinking again?
Rach!
Ok, ok, here is to my sister, the newly-appointed head lunch chef--
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area.
Hey, remember how Chandler and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?
No.
No.
He is saving your butt, ah, unless of course I'm stepping on some toes here, in which case I can just mosey on, I've got plenty of people to help on the Interstate.
No wait! Look, wait! Okay, you can hang up, but I'm gonna keep calling! I'm gonna, I'm gonna call everyone in England if that's what it takes to get you to talk to me!
Hey! Y'know that teacher who had a baby with her student?
This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner.
Oh yeah, Emily convinced me to do it.
I don't know, I don't get, I don't get it, I mean, wh, wh, two months ago Rachel and I were like, this close. Right now, what, I'm takin messages from guys she, she meets at the movies? I mean this, this Casey should be takin' down my messages, ya know, or, or, Rachel and I should be together and, and we should get some kind of me, message service.
Nothing. Oh, actually, great news! I just got off the phone with Emily and it looks like I'm moving to a new apartment. Woo-hoo!
Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?
I don't know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes.
Yeah.
Hey, Phoebs, how'd it go.
Yeah?
Hey.
Yay!
Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche I'll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.
Hey.
Thank you, but, but you gotta leave.
Wow! I didn't know that there was a Pottery Barn up here.
What did you get?
Y'know, she tried to undress me too.
Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.
What's that on the bottom?
Yes! No-no! I know, I know what the list is! Mom! Look if you see Chandler, could you just let him know I'm looking for him?
Come on! Here.
Mon, look who I ran into!
Hey!
Oh.
Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that may make you want to stay married. We register, and you get to keep all the presents!
Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.
What?
I Ross...
Okay, I'm going to start climb down you now.
Rach.
What?
I don't care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!
....I have to go to China.
Oh, see I-I don't know if we're gonna be hungry at three.
Oh, I've got to go pick up Ben, we've got a play date this afternoon.
No, no, no. I'm not in the zone.
I can handle the stick!!
Okay! Ho-ho! We did not steal your thunder because we are not getting back together!
Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn't happen!
Of course it's your friend Tanya.
Oh, somebody's feeling better.
DANGER!!!!
Okay. Um, how about these?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it's just a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter?
I can't catch a break!
What?!
That's a duck.
You've sentenced him?!
Oh! Oh-oh, the band's ready! Well, I-I-we gotta do what the band says-I don't care about the stupid band!!
Oh here, I think this is us. Yeah.
Oh, oh my God, is this the wrong day? I don't believe it, uh, well, hey, I guess if it works out we'll, we'll have something to tell the grandkids.
Rach! Whoops! Rach, hey, open up, please!
Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!
Uh-huh.
Y'know, if, if this is too weird for you, we can still back out at...
Get out.
Sure.
Look, I gotta go pick up Ben. Everything so far sounds great Joey, just remember to keep it on the mellow side, okay? Just a couple of guys hanging out playing poker, no-no strippers or anything okay?
Well how much time before she absolutely has to start getting ready?
Look, I am a reasonable man. I will accept store credit.
That is correct.
Open it, open in.
Ohh, I gotta go to the flower store! Check it out, no one will tell me where Emily is, so I'm gonna send 72 long-stem, red roses to Emily's parent's house, one for each day that I've known and loved her. That oughta get her talking to me again.
Marcel! What've you done to him?
Wait, how do you zoom out? There she is.
No, women are welcome to play.
Oh my God! You actually exchanged it!
You know what, I think we've had all the bad luck we're going to have.
Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isn't about the room, this is about what the room...represents! And unfortunately, this room could destroy you!!
All right, show's over. Nothing to see here. Ok, let's do laundry.
Yeah!
We had such a great time! She's-she's incredible! I thought the-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn't. It wasn't at all. Elizabeth is very mature for her age. A concept lost on some people!
Well, umm, why don't you give him a call?
Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said, 'nobody won that game, ' and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy and.... threw it in the lake.
I-I-I don't care if I said some other girl's name you prissy, old twit!
Ohh... OK.
Y'know I remember when uh, when I was in college, we used to...
Yeah, that's her.
Emily, there is nothing between Rachel and me. Okay? I love you.
Thank you.
A new place for a new Ross. I'm gonna have you and all the guys from work over once it's y'know, furnished.
That's no problem.
I don't know. A month?
I just found out that Elizabeth's dad wants to meet me.
Much better.
We have got to start locking that door!
College?
What, to blind my child?
Cousin Frannie's wedding, its tomorrow night.
What?! What does he want?! I wasn't doing anything!
C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.
Good-good, I'm-I'm married.
Oh my god.
You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?
Hi! What are you, what are you doing here?
There was never a good time.
Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it can't? Okay.
Thank you!
Where's my ring? My dead grandmother's wedding ring? Where is it? Where is it?
That was so cool man, the way you leaned on that guy.
Totally.
Hey!
Wow, Rhonda.
All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!
Still doing the screening thing?
Yes!
Somewhere maybe along the equator?
Uh, oh-ho bye.
Does it always, uh--?
The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Turn! Turn!
Isn't Rachel supposed to be back by now?
Ok fine.
Congratulations.
It was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back!! Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means 'you are,' Y-O-U-R means 'your!'
This is not good for my rage.
Yeah-yeah I uh, I have a uh, a guy problem.
I don't believe this. I miss, I miss the first time of everything. I missed, what, the first time he rolled over, the first time he crawled. What else did I miss? Has he spoken yet, is he driving, does he have a favorite liquour?
Yeah, well.
Uh, hello, it's third down.
Nu-uh!
Hey! I just got uh, my teacher evaluations! Check out what this one student wrote, "I loved Dr. Geller's class. Mind blowing lectures! Dr. Geller, you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department!"
See, I would never snap at you like that.
I don't think tho.
Hey Chandler. Monica!
Oh, mine too. Isn't that neat, scotch neat. Would you excuse me? Hey, hey, where you uh, sneakin off to mister?
Look, I know what you're going through. When I turned 50 I got the Porsche. You... you got your own little speedster.
Whaddya see?
I gotta get to work.
Hey, let's bring the rest of these down to the truck.
Really?
I'm getting married, to..day!!
Sweetie, don't worry you'll get picked. Chandler.
What?! How's that?
So, you gals wanna hand over your money now? That way, we don't have to go through the formality of actually playing.
Look, Mon, do you want us to uh, come back later?
Hey!
Hi .
Y'know, I think they have those at that British pub near the trade center.
Step back.
Nobody likes change.
: Joey, I'm a little shy.
No Chandler, everything! Like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique, stamina, girth....
Thanks, Gunther. Hey! Umm, can I get a napkin too?
No, 10 is the highest.
Uh, excuse me, uh, where can we find the monkey?
She wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong in our relationship. I mean she goes on for five pages about, about how I was unfaithful to her! WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!
You called Animal Control?
No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too.
Bye!
Because you sent away the dog!
Thank you.
Yeah, but-but he didn't know that!
What? No! Of course, of course I do! Are-are they gone?
It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech.
I'm shipping out tomorrow.
Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!
One.
Hello! Oh, sorry.
Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go.
This is unbelievable.
Well, you should've seen the guy that she used to go out with. I mean, he's like Joe Rugby.
Hey-hey, since you're the 'fix-it' lady, here's a pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesn't want to have the wedding at all?
No, it's okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I don't...
What?
It went great! And I didn't need any jokes or naked chicks either!
What'd you do, take him whaling?
C'mon, just tell me, please, please.
Joey?!
Right. Right, okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I yelled.
All right, that's it! Come-you-no! You are in big trouble young man!
Really?! So what would you say Pheebs? Stuff like uh, "Keep your mitts off my grub?"
What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again?
You take care Jill.
Well you said you couldn't go out so....
Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right?
Yeah!
I've been back and forth.
Y'know what? I'm good! I'm good!
Emotional hell. So, did they lend you the money yet?
See ya!
...desperate, needy, pathetic?
Okay, umm. Did you ever see, um, Return Of The Jedi?
Okay, okay, okay, I've got two cabs and no people. Go! Go! Go!
...can't, can't a guy send a barbershop quartet to his girlfriend's office anymorrrrre!!
What?
Aww.
Just a sandwich. Turkey, a little mustard...
What?! Over a stupid room!
And in my defense, the cleaning lady came on to me!
Maybe this would've happened if I'd been more nurturing, or I'd paid more attention, or I... had a uterus. I can't believe this!
Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.
There he is!!
Cassie?!
Cat!
You're right, you're right, it is.
Monica? You're Mom.
You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? Someone who wakes up every morning thinking "Oh my god, I'm with Rachel". You know, someone who makes you feel good, the way I am with Julie. Was there a second of all?
The Armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! Okay Ben, it's time to light the Hanukkah candles!
No. No, I didn't. I didn't want to be that guy.
There you go. Thank you!
And, I came up with Atlantic City.
Well if you can't remember, can't we just forget about this?
Ohio!! Thank you!
What?
Ohh, I just like the smell. Mmmm.
Pheebs, you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec?
Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.
Crack isn't even an intravenous drug!
Y'know what? She'd-she'd love this. Uh, it's an exact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade.
Okay, it's not, it's not.
...and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should've just lasted just one day, burned for...
Look, I don't wanna make any trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented.
What's she look like?
Oh, come on it's only three blocks! And-and, it's not very heavy, try it! Come on! Come on!
Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses.
Ross, wants a pajmena?
Okay.
But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.
Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh...
Hey you guys.
All righty roo. What a great moment to say that for the first time.
We know!
So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?
What happened?
When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?
It took two people to break up this relationship!!
The physical act of love.
You see Amanda and I have a very special...
I cannot sleep in a public place.
Rachel, this is your apartment.
Phoebe!
Stop saying, "Blood" to strangers.
Yeah? All right I'll call the airlines.
No, I mean it's okay, I mean, they're-they're my friends. In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them.
Because I am bored...Out of my mind. I've already been to the bank, post office, and the dry cleaners.
Seven years. I mean we've been together seven years, she's the only woman who's ever loved me, and the only woman I've-I've ever....
Getting married. Okay. Okay. You can, you can do that too! Just like you've done everything else!
Oh, Monica, I figured I'd come by tomorrow morning and pick up Fluffy's old cat toy, OK?
Phoebe.
I did.
Rach. OK, forget, forget the lobsters OK. We're, let's talk, what about us?
Hey.
How do you know? You don't have a watch.
Ohhh.
That's okay, I'm cool over here. I'll catch up with you later, Joey.
My first time with Carol was...
Gosh, we talked about that but your brother has so many science trophies and plaques and merit badges, well we didn't want to disturb them.
Yes, it's a deadly but beautiful sport.
Yeah, I know, so what? I mean, who's-who's to say? Does that me we-we can't do it? Look, huh, I was with Carol for four years before we got married and I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian. I mean, this, this makes sense for us. Come on! I mean, on our first date we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont! I mean, last night I got my ear pierced! Me! This feels right. Doesn't it?
Help! Help!
I was barefoot. Now tell me, the toilet thing is the only thing you taught him right?
Okay. Ben? Come here. All right, I'm gonna leave you here with Aunt Rachel for about an hour. Okay? Are you gonna be okay?
Just the one divorce in '99! Y'know what, I am gonna be happy this year. I am gonna make myself happy.
Yeah, well...
Good morning. Hey pal, look who I brought. It's your old friend Harry Elefante.
So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date?
Hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, we'd still hang out?
No, no, I'm serious. Thank you.
Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she?
I like this one. It seems to say, "I love you and that's why I have to kill you."
You uh, you may have been right about Jill.
Do not rush me!!
So you guys, who else did you tip with cookies?
I can't believe someone would do that for a grade.
Hey Ross! It's you! I just want you to remember this feeling. You are lucky to be alive! So live everyday to the fullest. Love yourself, okay? Okay. Oh, and also get stamps. Bye!
Hey, there.
Wow, it, it's neat learning about submarines.
Umm, no.
Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding!
Alright you kids, bye now.
Nuh, uh, the moment's gone.
Marcel. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Good boy. Good boy. C'mere, gimme the rice. Thank you, good boy. Well, I see he's finally mastered the difference between 'bring me the' and 'pee in the'. 'Bring me the' and- Rach?
No! The reason I'm asking is that... I sorta had one last night.
Okay!
Funny, my birthday was seven months ago.
OK. Hold my board.
What, do you, well umm, oh how about I come up there?
So Pheebs, are you gonna go back out there or what?
It's my joke.
Yeah! We'd meet, we'd meet total strangers, and hang out with them!
Look Emily, I'm just having dinner with my friends, okay?
Cool!
So, Dr. Green, how's the old boat.
Damn, this coffee's cold! Hey Rach, do you mind if I heat this up on your loins?
You'll see.
Well, I'm-I'm just glad I could, y'know, help you out.
Well, they painted over the word 'Sapien' for one thing, then they rearranged the figures, let's just leave it at that.
Yeah, 'cause life's just that kind.
What guys? Oh, yeah.
Hey! So ah, what did the insurance company say?
Waitohheyhuh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!
Hey roomies!
I'm familiar with his work, yes...
Hey. Happy Thanksgiving!
I picked up the divorce papers. Uh, I've already signed everything and I put little 'X's where you need to sign.
Oh yeah? I guess we'll just see!
Okay, I think I got it.
I can't believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in. Man, some-some stranger's gonna be living in my room.
Come on, let's go!
Yeah, but wait...
Hi!
Oh, right!
Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y-
Ross, uh and uh, I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight. And, uh, for the record she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis. What are you doing I'm serious. Uh, the reason she walked out on, on Barry is simply that she didn't love him, which incidentally worked out pretty well for me Cheers.
Phoebe, you can't massage people in my apartment!
Oh I a lot of stuff!
OK, turn around. I just don't want you staring at me when I'm doing this.
She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.
Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still haven't gotten it.
It's like that everywhere, Joey! Okay, Mon, back me up here. Where you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right? And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?
What are you doing? Are you trying to hurt me? Or something?
I've got to talk to her. Ugh, I hate this part.
Is there somebody else?
Some would say she's attractive, yes.
Hey, someone order a coat?
No, no way. You've got it totally the other way around my friend. John Voit was...
I know.
Try telling my wife that.
Hey!
Okay umm, bad stuff. Well, I'm-I'm 12 years older than she is.
You told her before you told us?
So five of us is, $33.50 apiece.
Well, but aren't you pissed at him?! I mean this guy abandoned you! I gotta tell you if this were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger! I mean I-I-I'd walk in there and I'd be like, "Yo, dad! You and me outside right now!" I kinda scared myself.
Ok, well then get some sense. I mean it took you what, 10 years to get that job, who knows how long it's gonna be till you get another.
Alright.
Uh, Phoebe...
I, Ross...
What's going on?! That's what's going on!!
I whitened them.
Dude!
Oh, I don't know how that got in there.
I just, I hate this so much! I mean, every time I go pick her up at the airport, it's-it's so great. But at the same time I'm thinking, "Well, I'm gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off."
Of... of what?
I'm just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y'know? I used them as mittens, I didn't want to touch a thing in that last place.
It felt like a 'big guy' moment.
So that's the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn't have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I'm a good listener and I uh I put on a great slide show!
Oh! So-so seriously, what time?
No, I will not!
Hey!
Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y'know? She lives so close. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that was-if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasn't kidding, she's not fun, she's stupid, and kind of a racist.
So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean it's a really big step! And-and what's the rush?!
Again, it's not that he...
So do we!! So do we!! I'm sorry you had to see that.
Mm.
The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.
Umm...
What you got over there? Tacos?
Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid.
Cool.
I am sorry, Chandler.
Hi!
Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.
No, no, no, no. Tick, tick, tick, tick.
There it is.
No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't think breast milk is for adults.
Hi! What's ah, what's Mark doing answering your phone?
Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more...
What am I looking at?
No!
Oh, yeah, why not?
How 'bout Ben?
Hi! Listen uhh, this cat belongs to a little girl. There are flyers all over the place.
Why do they keep doing that?
Looks like a fun gang.
But...
Really? No. I mean, nah, I haven't played in so long, and-and, well it's-it's really personal stuff, y'know?
And-and I, and I saw that Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of him to-to surprise him and, and then I pretended I didn't know he was in there.
We're all alone in an empty apartment.
About four hours.
It wasn't so much a party as...a gathering of people, with food, and music, and, and the band.
Who's Richard Burke? Doc, Doctor Burke? You have a date with Doctor Burke? Why, why, why should that bother me? I, I love that man, he's like a uh, brother to dad.
There's other stuff too.
It didn't.
This is so exciting, I haven't seen my monkey in almost a year.
So it's looks like we're the first ones here.
What about Ben? We can't bring a baby to a hospital.
Take thee, Rachel... Emily. Emily.
Chandler-
Yeah, y'know for dating, general merriment, taking back to your windmill...
Hey, can I, can I get in on that? Because I'm kinda hungry myself.
It's-it's hot...
Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course!
Hi Frannie, congratulations.
Hey, I'm more cop than you two!
Oh no. Dad! Dad! What... Oh God...everything's ruined! Dad, she's gonna be crushed!
Did you tell your sister to ask me out?
No! For all I know, she's trying to find me but couldn't because I kept moving around. No, from now on, I'm staying in one place. Right here.
Maybe it's a universal thing?
Well that's different! Okay? Because he, he was actually in love with me!
Joey, I did not break this! Okay? That has been broken for a while.
Okay, okay, yes, it is. How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age.
Yeah. So um, I-I heard about this ah, Mark guy that ah, Rachel met today.
So this is your office?
There's my boy! Here's my boy! And here's his Barbi What's ah, what's my boy doing with a Barbi?
Well we did it, we're here. We are standing our ground. How long does a cup of coffee take?
Besides, there's a big age difference.
So really, what'd ya have?
Y'know I have dinner plans!!
I don't get it, he seemed so happy to see me yesterday.
Nothing, I'm-I'm just, I'm so comfortable with you!
Paolo. Hi.
Don't ask me, I had it and I blew it!
People can hear you.
Marlon?!
Just uh, brought back your videos.
I'm having a son. Um...
Hi Pheebs!
So, uh, he's back.
This would be the place where you explain the hat.
What?!
Well, so, you-you'll get a job here! I mean, I'm always hearing about uh, them foreigners coming in here and stealing American jobs; that could be you!
Don't blame the questions!
I would never do that!
And the Irish guy wins the joke!
I dunno, maybe it's because you're really sarcastic. Or maybe it's cause you uh-
Yes, her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow.
Okay, good bye!
Oh, hello.
So Rach, maybe you and I could fly out together Saturday.
That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross... Uh-oh.
Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella. Don't, don't just dismiss this so fast. I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...
I'm not going to do that.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on, come on, what. You took his underwear?
Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel.
See?
Yep. Okay.
Nope. I mean, I know Susan does every year, but I think I wanna take this year to teach him all about Hanukkah.
That's all you're basing this on?
It's okay man, be strong.
Phoebe!
Yeah, i-it's for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they don't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them to give us the boit'sit's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. So here's my itinerary . Um... here's a picture of me...
As in, "I now pronounce you wife and wife" married?
I'm gonna, I'm gonna go to London and I'm going to fight for her.
Well, I tracked down Marcel and get this, he's healthy, he's happy, and he's right here in New York filming Outbreak II - The Virus Takes Manhattan.
No, but. . .
Phoebs, It's open! It's open!
No problem.
Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.
Okay, it's second down. Take all the second downs you need.
Okay sorry, whew.
Ohh! Okay! Okay. "There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into..."
Well I'm sorry, I think about stuff. Ya know, I mean, you're at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders.
No-no, it's not that, it's just... I-I just moved in.
You tell them to wait!
And his first name.
What are you doing here?!
I love it, when we share.
What's going on?
A little? Your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue. Oh look at that! The ornamental bird cage! Large!
Well, there goes my whole belief system.
Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her.
She hates Pottery Barn?!!
Ok, just, just remember how crazy I am about you, ok?
Wow!
I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.
They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.
Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?
I have no idea. I mean... But-but I assure you I will figure it out.
Are you kidding?
Why don't you come, I mean, I-I have two tickets, why not?
I do not always have to be-okay, okay.
Yes!
Well I...I told him that if he ever hurt you I would hunt him down and kick his ass! What?! What?! What is the matter with everybody?! I am serious! I would kick his ass!
Look, I didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep.
Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we're never gonna get along.
It gives it a nice antiquey look.
No-no-no! It's mine! It's-it's mine.
Ahh. Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?
Who's that?
No, I've looked everywhere!
Hey.
Sorry I ah, I scared you in there.
No. No-no uh, he just, he just really freaked me out before.
Do you uh, do you talk about me?
Well you sure used a large font.
And on your anniversary, for shame!
Okey-dokey!
No, no, it's okay. Really. They're plenty of people who just see their sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey at Burger King. So is, is that better?
She, she was different.
About yesterday, I was really wrong. I am sorry.
I'm the ring bearer.
Well, he's finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head?
Hi.
It's the only possibility, Phoebe.
Actually, nectarines, but basically...
Wait hold on Tony, hold on. Hello. Hi, yeah no, she's right here. Um hold on. Hi Tony, can I call you back? That's uh, that's my sister's boyfriend.
OK, my hands were no where near your butt.
It's all right.
That's right good things, that-that is what I said.
Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?
Cool!
'Cause I know what you're trying to pull here. Okay? It's not gonna work.
And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
No.
What thing?
Oh my-Come here! Come here! It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay.
No real-, honey, really it's fine, just g-go with Susan. Really, I, no, I think girls night out is a great idea. Okay, okay, bye
The big book of childrens' names.
Ohh, Geller's got one hooked! Ohh! Looks like a big one! Yeah, ohh! Ohh! It's the classic struggle between man and- Someone knocked over a lamp.
Of course he is! What, do you think I'd just use my son as-as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am?
I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg.
Well umm, y'know, I used to play.
Over here.
What can I say, you missed your chance. From now on the only person who's going to enjoy these bad boys is me.
Good evening, sir. My name is Ross Geller. I'm one of the people who applied for the apartment. And I-I realize that the competition is fierce but-I'm sorry. I, I can't help but notice you're naked and I applaud you. Man, I wish I was naked. I mean, this-this looks so great. That is how God intended it.
Good luck!
Dr. Franzblau, hi.
Why?
It wasn't the best.
I don't know, but-but look how shiny!
"Hey Ross, it's you!" Oh yeah, no that's-that's an old message, nobody needs to hear that.
Oh, eh, just thinking about Emily getting married tomorrow.
Thanks guys! I really appreciate this, y'know, but you don't have to rub my butt.
Oh! Yeah.
No, it's just...you know the whole "getting on with your life" thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. And um, and then I'm here talkin' to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to...You know, here's a wacky thought. Um, what's say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know. You can't deny it. Besides, you're carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see, you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. I love you.
OK. I'm in my apartment...
Chandler. When did he... when did he... when did he?
Ahh.
Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
Huh, I'm just saying...
'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your home?
Okay, gimme my monkey back.
My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich. I can't believe someone ate it!
Yeah, you're right.
Nothing, it's just that hypnosis is beyond crap.
No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!
Gimme the this!
Need some help?
What the hell are you doing? You scared the crap outta me.
That's impossible, he's got a twinkie in the city.
Hi.
Rach, thanks but uh, I don't need you doing me any favors.
Cat.
Okay. So uh, well, this-this is uh, this is awkward.
It's a rug.
Sweetie, it's be gonna okay, all right. It's a wedding, generally people focus on the bride.
Hey.
What?! You totally get embarrassed!
No, no, with him. I'm on this field, and they, they hike me the baby... and I, I know I've gotta do something 'cause the Tampa Bay defence is comin' right at me.
Oh but I-I-I haven't paid you yet!
OK. Oh, oh, oh.
Hey!
Please hurry.
At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies.
Well, okay, what-what did she say?
Oh, we just...
Look guys, when I'm with her it's-it's-it's like she brings this-this-this great side out of me. I mean I-I-I love her, y'know?
Y'know, I don't think we're going to settle this.
How come? Everybody else does.
You were in a porno?
Emily!
Yeah, we went shopping!
Well, apparently not, and I can't just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the silliness!
You'll never get me, Joe!!!
Well, you-you've always had glasses.
Well, I'm gonna kiss you.
Oh yeah.
What's goin' on?
Dad, dad, dad, I'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing. Did you uh, ever get this sort of... panicky, "Oh my god I'm gonna be a father" kind of a thing?
No, he's at uh, Carol's and Susan's today.
Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?
Get married.
Why? Did you write it?
Yes. Yes I do.
No!! Y'know-y'know don't do me any favours. In fact, where, where's the rest of my stuff?! Huh? Like-like my umm, Hey, this book is mine!! And-and-and, and that T-shirt you sleep in? I'd like that back too. Yes, I do.
How's it going?
What is it?
No, you've heard my practice. Okay? Just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want. And I'm not going to tell you what song I'm gonna play either. But uh, let's just say when it's over I'll bet there will be a we bit o' celebration.
No, I ah, I slept with someone else.
Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.
OK, tip the man.
Really? Its not just frowned upon?
You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.
Hey guys!
Enough with geography for the insane, okay? Let's play some ball, guys.
Later!
No! And I'm not gonna be, so you can save you little speech.
C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact!
Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling.
I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.
Come on, seriously.
All we're saying is don't rush into anything.
What?
Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.
Ah, the heart of every healthy relationship. Honesty, respect, and sex with celebrities.
No, not since I lost her at the airport.
I mean, I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.
At least they knew what yours was. Y'know, yours had a name.
All right, y'know what? If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then I'm sorry, I'm just gonna have to take it back.
I'm pretty sure that it is...
How is that important?
I know.
That's not bad.
Oh God!
Will you-will you please?
Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I'm not invited to sleep-overs.
I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.
Ohh.
Argh!
C'mon.
And that wasn't fun for you?
All right, let's go! Bye, Pheebs!
Monica's big night, she shouldn't pay.
Uh-oh, saved by the bell. Hello?
Hey!
Well, Mon, I was married.
Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid?
I hate Chandler, the bastard ruined my life.
Not so good.
That's not true! Her, she doesn't even know what she wants! Rachel's still mad about the whole thing.
Mine.
Whoa, hello, did you just meet Monica?
Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "hey, you're not Bob."
Wow, uh, Joey that's-that's great. Thanks man.
No! Oh, no-no-no. Hey, you weren't bad, you've been very good, Ben.
My mommies love me. That's clever.
Let-let me make sure I'm hearing this right, you're ending this with me because I'm too whiney? So you're saying, I've become so whiney that I annoy you, Janice.
The kid...? Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck.
How can I not get this? I'm a college professor; I got 1450 on my S.A.T.s.
Hey.
I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.
No. No, I gotta go home sometime.
Hey!
Juice, I need...
...Gets interrupted. Hi!
It's my joke.
Look at him. I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in.
I wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun.
Goodnight.
Oh! Oh my God! I didn't even see you!
And you're afraid you won't be able to...fill his shoes.
You're gonna be a party person! Those guys rock the most!
According to Chandler, what phenomenon scares the bejeezus out of him?
Get the what?
Well hello! She's cute! Should we uh, go try to talk to her?
Hey
No.
Ohh, it was the best!
Okay, fine, fine. You don't want to believe me? No, that's fine.
Mma, Mma, Mmaah
Hello.
Wow! Happy Monica's night!
The routine!
That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?
Ah. Joey you're-you're having lunch with my mom?
So I'm a pimp huh? It's okay! Look, I know that sometimes I can be a pain in the ass, but you just have to talk to me. Tell me if something is bothering you. Okay? And for my part I will do everything I can to keep my annoying habits just .
Right.
Y'know what? It sounds so weird to say this but, I just had a great day with Janice!
Look-Okay, I'm just gonna-I'm gonna have to go find him and bring him back! Okay? You-you make sure Monica does not find out, okay?
Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me.
Yeeeeeep... Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took out on her dad's boat she wouldn't let me help at all.
Hi Tushie.
...Now that was fun.
Yes, we did, everything's A-OK!
What woman?
Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn't say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.
Hi.
Well, I kinda half to. I mean, because the thing is...
Yay! Seriously, our sex life... I was thinking, maybe I don't know, we could try some-some new things. Y'know? For fun?
Oh, taking my parents back to the hotel.
Unagi is a state of total awareness. Okay? Only by achieving true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you!
What trail?
Ohh! That would be great.
Joey, get out of the fridge.
Well, this was fun. Uh, we should really do it again sometime, wha'dya say? Ok. Alright so I've got him.
Oh no-no-no-no!
Monica's right. We're talking about getting married here. Okay? She-she can't just rush into this.
So, he's just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesn't want anything in exchange for helping him?
I don't, I don't think we've meet. I-I'm Ross.
That-that would be incredible. Thank you so much. I-I still can't believe someone ate it!! I mean, look, I left a note and everything.
Ow, ow, OK. Alright, alright, Mon, Mon, you've gone ultrasonic again, alright.
No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I'm happy for ya, but I'm tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don't know what to do anymore.
Yeah, me too.
I-I know. Well if something comes up...
Well, the lighting was okay.
No, I'm getting back down 'cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she's like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.
Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title?
Excuse me?
Look you're my wife. We're-we're married. Y'know? I-I love you. I-I really miss you.
We were all pretty shaken up about it.
Come here. Listen, you deserve so much better than him...you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you.
Hey, 30 is not that old! Do you know how old the Earth is?
You're welcome.
It could happen.
I'm-I'm gonna wear this all the time! I love this shirt!!
Yeah, if you're really hungry. It was a joke, I made a joke.
Uh, so this play umm, what do you think? It's-it's gotten great reviews! Y'know the uh...
'Kay!
Oh-oh, guess what? I-I have a date with Elizabeth Hornswoggle.
I think he can be.
: OK, I am calling your seventeen. What do you got?
Really?
Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.
So uh, Emily just went to the airport.
Okay, why are you here?
Well, hello, Mrs. Ross!
Argh!
I'm gonna call her.
No! Do you wanna hear it?
Yeah! Got it!
Disneyland, 1989, 'It's a Small World After All.'
OK sweetie, I'll see you later.
Yeah, but still, cheap shot!
Oh, yeah, well y'know Chandler printed it up on his computer.
Your joke? Well, I think 'the Hef' would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.
Hey, I've been doin' it since the ninth grade, I've gotten pretty damn good at it.
Oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, I was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all, we all are using it.
What do you think you're doing?!
My fault?! You threatened the judge!
Susan, go deep.
Emily.
Oh. Wow! Huh. Boy! Well, someone's been doing their homework.
Yeah, of course, Donald.
You okay?
Come on!
So you're strong enough to face her on your own?
Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived! Here.
I got it at Pottery Barn!! Okay?!
No! Why?
You know the song! Sing along!
Jill, how did you pay for all this? I thought your dad took away your credit card.
And it can't be Joey.
Way to go guys. Y'know, you-you were really good at the stuff too.
Do not give him any money!
Yes, professor Feesen-sen-stenlger... I'll be with you in one moment. So, I will take one box of the Thin Mints.
And I'm sure you're gonna make a big impression. Hi! I'm Rachel Green. It's nice to meet you. Come on, you probably have a broken rib!
Can't we just use a pen?
I know if you were getting married I'd feel, kinda..... y'know.
Well then we'll-we'll see you the day after tomorrow. Mom?! Dad?! What-what...what you guys doing here?!
Yeah!!
And it could've just as easily have been a bullet.
Excellent, that was excellent.
All right, it's cool you can stay here. My parents won't mind.
Bye Janine!
It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.
What?! Why?
What's wah-pah?
I found a note on my door, "Come to Monica's quick, bring champagne and a Three Musketeers bar."
Hey! What's up?
Yeah, okay you're right.
You are way off, pal.
No, it's my joke, it's mine. You can call them, they'll tell you.
You chipped in?!
Oh my God, what's goin' on?
I was thinking more like a hundred.
Your good friend?
Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?
Oh, whatever.
I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.
Yeah! I opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that's been happening to me. I mean I talked for hours. It is amazing to have someone give you such-such focused attention.
We were drunk! I would've married uh, Joey with that amount of alcohol!
Yeah.
No! Okay! Okay! Okay, look, can I, can I just-just talk to you for a second?
Ok, and then you take the poopie diaper and you put it in the poopie diaper pail.
We were on a break!!! Okay!! We were, we were..., yeah. Where are you? I'll find you.
Hey guys!
Oh no, yeah no, that part's great!
Thanks.
Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's Thanksgiving.
No! Pick me! I don't want to end up an old maid!
What?!
Pop it in.
Oh, I kinda was, wasn't I?
Hello.
If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine.
You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
Carol, what's the matter? What happened?
Oh, where are you guys going?
Hi.
This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on.
What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.
Look, face it, my father is not going to pay for the build-in barbecue and believe me you can kiss you gazebo goodbye. Now I might be able to get you the new lawn.
Well...
Yeah, sure.
Okay, Monica: Right foot red.
Well, ya know, someone should have called me.
Yes.
What?
What?
What's that supposed to mean?
Hi. Sorry Im late. Wheres, wheres Carol?
You know how close women can get.
I- I think they're great! I, I really do.
Thank you.
Coffee sounds great. Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?
You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?
No, no, wait, ok, ok, look at the other side. Look at Julie's column.
Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldn't invite her?
What's going on?
Hi.
Yeah. You, uh, you want some?
...now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt.
No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry?
No, it's really not that bad. I mean, I-I for one, feel perfectly safe.
I gave him an extremely professional massage!
Hello!
No, she kept kicking me away!
O-okay, Rach calm-calm down, okay? She-she's really upset we're just talking.
Ok, ok, you know what? I think you're very funny. Kudos on that hat joke. But, come on guy just, just give him back the hat.
Umm...
Oh. Uh, by the way, if it makes you feel any better. I happen to like 8-year-old boys.
Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too much, way, way, too much, it's a sickness really.
Wow, Monica's letting other people help decorate her tree! Did someone get her drunk again or?
No, Rach, come on. Rach! Rach, no, no! She's not Rachel, she is, she is not, Ra--Rachel?
Oh my God. I mean...
Thing, yes. Thing.
So, what's going on now?
So, I just picked up a message from Emily, she and Susan are going to a poetry reading together!
How could I forget?
Hi!
Oh my God! I love this apartment! Isn't it perfect?! I can't believe I never realized how great it is!
Ok, here, here. There we go.
That may be the most depressing thing I've heard in my life. I should probably get these to my lawyer's office.
Well, can't you at least stall her a little? I'll-I'll go back to some of the places I went last night.
We are never gonna find him! He's one guy in a huge city!
Dear Lord!!
What's going on?
There you go! Good enough for your party, huh?
Yeah. Tell ya what, let's not invite any of the anthropologists, only the dinosaur dudes!
I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision? I'm actually asking you!
No!
And that's funny, why?
How are you?
I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!
Whoa! You had sex today?
What?
Hi honey, how did it go?
Okay.
Then don't. Stay here. Just don't go so soon to London, just one more day.
She is a kook.
What? A brain transplant?!
Exactly. So you didn't, didn't mention anything to Issac right?
Carol?
Well, I asked him if he wanted to eat, he said, "No." I asked him if he wanted to sleep, he said, "No." I asked him what he wanted to do, he said, "No." So, he's sweeping.
What are you doing here, Santa?
That's okay, I'm not so crazy about myself right now either.
And um...You look nice today.
You have to respect the sea!
He looks so tiny.
I can't believe he didn't come!
Oh, fire! There, there's a fire! Fire!!
The sex? Um, I'm having enough trouble with the image of you and Susan together, when you throw in Tanya , yaw...
Okay.
No. Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing.
Hey Rach. I, uh, got you a little present. . . I'll open it. It's a Slinky! Remember, huh. Walks down stairs, alone or in pairs, everyone knows it's. . . just a big spring. Alright, you still mad at me becuase of the whole. . .
'Kay, first of all, this attitude is not helping.
You're not getting away this time mister! Unless you want that ass kicking we talked about!
Yeah?
Gentlemen, you're pick.
Great! Because Emily and I are getting married in a month!
Mon?
Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too?
Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that.
Oh, this is Monica.
What?! That's not gonna make you any money!
Well just hold him like you'd hold a football.
Hey! You were so right!
Yeah but Pottery Barn! Y'know what I think? It's just she-she's weird. Y'know it's because she's a twin. Twins are weird.
So what's it shaped like?
Oh no!
-she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation?
What's a scrud?
Ahh, sorry, nothing you can do about it. It's one of my ah, rights as the ex-boyfriend. Oop, oh yeah!
Yeah. So...
Okay.
I mean after tomorrow night.
Well umm...
Okay. Cool.
Not nice enough.
Yeah!
Nevermind.
He left that.
Oh, I'm threatened by you?
We're really gonna do this, huh?
..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he-
Well what is it? Is it a mole?
You do Pheebs?
Apparently Phoebe's mother also goes by the name Julio.
Come here, here, come here, come here, Mrs. Buffay. Sorry, about what I said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you were just a cat. When clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friend's mother.
Thank you, thank you.
Sure. Sure. Look I don't, I don't know if your plans are finalized yet, but umm, hey I-I know another great way to blow off steam.
So-so come! Why don't you come?
I'm agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe yet?
What?
Look, Chandler, it's my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel any better they don't print the name, so it doesn't really matter who gets credit, right?
Hi.
Sorry-sorry Jill.
Oh fine.
Huh.
What, woah, woah, $3500 at porcelain safari?
All right, fine! Fine! Have me fired! But uh, I want you to know that you and I are not all that different. I mean, I too am a neat guy.
Alright.
That must be our alcohol and beers!
It's a girl! Anyway, it wou-it wouldn't matter. Okay? Because I'm a teacher and she's a student.
It does not!
You tryin' to be clever? A funny lady?
Hey.
Actually, it looks really good.
My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, I went to see it, and there were students makin' babies right in the middle of the Paleontology section!
What? Let me see.
You get the dollhouse.
All right, try pedaling.
Got it!
Huh. Y'know what's not one of a kind? A twin!
Yeah!!
Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that much trouble.
No, this is pretty much it.
Okay! Okay! That's it!! Parents!! Parents!! Back away!! All right, this is our wedding day! From now on everyone gets along, and if I hear one more word. NO GRANDCHILDREN! That's right!!
Dad, you really don't want to do that.
Oh, I promise, what.
Got me.
No. No, no. She doesn't want to see you right now.
What? Your-your list?
Ahhhh!!
Uh-huh, Carol, so were we. All right, just-just imagine for a moment, Susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. Y'know? Say-say they're coming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks, they're laughing, y'know, someone innocently touches someone else... There's electricity, it's new. It's exciting. Are you telling me there isn't even the slightest possibility of something happening?
Okay, okay! I'm going. I'm going.
Uh, lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk when Roland's not there. Here's to my little sister--
Hi, is Rachel there?
Yeah.
Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes.
Well. Hey...
Zoo dollars?
No, I tried that. She says it has a weird smell.
Okay.
What?
Ohh.
Can I ask you somethin'?
Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the Paleontology section? See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.
Ok, we were sitting over there playing on the floor and he grabs the table and he pulls himself up. He pulled himself up. Standing man. I'm sorry you guys missed it but I did tape it so it you guys want to see it.
Oh. Uhh...
I'm fine. Just-just... having my worst fear realised...
Ohhhh
Well, I'm off to Carol's.
Well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don't uh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they're related to.
Press the button.
Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?
Hey.
No.
Hmm-Hmm.
Here you go.
I'm getting married today!! Whoo-hoo!!
What happened?
Are you sure?
Ok, what the hell happened back there?
There might be, a teeny, tiny, possibility.
All right. Okay, here we go!
Tuesday right. Ok, bye you guys.
Okay, then why do you have to wear underwear tonight?
Okay. You uh, you wanna hear something weird?
No, no, Dad, I was just wondering.
Look, our table is down in front, okay, my boss is gonna be there, everyone will see if we arrive after it starts.
That's okay. She's still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, it's too late to do any of the things I had planned, so...
Which one was that?
No Joey! Look why don't, why don't we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, we'll each go out with her one more time. And-and we'll see who she likes best.
Congratu!! -lations-lations.
I am now.
Mrs. Bing.
I know. My arm is killing me.
You're not laughing.
Well, if he's angry, he really shouldn't just cover it up. I-I wish he would just tell me the truth.
When, when were you... under me?
Ahh.
Not hating Yanni is not a real reason.
All right.
Oh, I hate this story.
You know what I don't care. The only person I cared about getting dressed, is the one person that says she's not even gonna go. Look Rach, I'm sorry. Okay. Look, I-I wa, I was a jerk. I'm sorry I yelled. I want you there, I need you there. Look, what, what can I do that can show you how much, how much I want you to be there.
What's goin' on?
I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps.
Oh, great. Great. There was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it.
Well, Rachel's having drinks with him tonight.
I may not know any of your flash dances but I'm no slouch on the dance floor.
What? What?
Honey, just relax, it's gonna be fine. Hey, umm,. why don't I come down there and I'll take you out to lunch?
Happy too.
Good-good-good.
Ugh. Well, we're just gonna have to jump. Yeah. Now, we're gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay? Not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownish red stuff in the middle. So, when you get down there...you go up to the roof and you let me in.
What's-what's the difference?
Dude.
Break!!
Look, if you'd had two failed marriages, you'd understand!
Yeah, that's okay, I mean if you guys all have to go away for the first weekend I'm alone by myself, y'know then I totally, totally understand.
Huh? Yeah, fine, invite whoever you want.
Yeah, huh.
She's having lunch with him. She's having lunch with him. And you should of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job. And, and, and, he's really good looking. What am I gonna do?
Ya know, maybe, maybe I should just go.
Yeah! Oh yeah, you'll be fine! It-it'll be uh, just like bungy jumping. Y'know? But instead of bouncing back up you-you won't.
Monica!
We're still married! Don't tell Rachel. See you later.
Okay! Hey Tommy.
What?
He told you everything! I mean you totally cracked him!
You're wrong.
It's alright, it's no big deal.
Okay, forward. Forward-Stop! Okay, back-Stop! Okay, forward-Stop! Stop! Stop!
No-no-no! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.
Okay! Now, I'm going to touch you. Ohh, that's soft.
Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls?
What?
Beef in a dessert?! I- no no no, there is no way!
Hello, baby. Hello, hello.
Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.
That's funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel!
Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad.
Ok, bye. Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.
Monica said that did she?
Well, I'm going to take off. Congratulations man.
Bye sweetie.
Rach, come on, if you think about it, it's actually kinda funny. Okay, maybe it's best not to think about it.
In the death seat?!!
Hey! How long until Pete's fight?
Umm, your boxes are umm...
Chandler!
Hi Janine!
So you do know a little English.
When?
You have 30 seconds. And the lightning round begins-stop it -now. What was Monica's nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
Hey Rach!
Phoebe, you said it was urgent!
Hey!
You're fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver.
What, you didn't get it? The doctor is a monkey.
No, I mean, look I don't know if anything is going to happen with us, again. Ever. But I don't want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector.
I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.
Oh my God, the pages are stuck together!
Yeah.
Probably around gonorrhea.
It tastes like feet!
What?
Elizabeth, thank God! I was just thinking about...
But you already told me everything.
Oh yeah!
Come on. I got it.
Well thanks!
No, no, I was turnin' the knob and, and. . . here it is.
Sure. Once, at work I-I thought carbon dating was fossilized...
Yeah, y'know what? I'll take it myself, thank you! All right Rach, let's go!
Oh, sure. Whoa-whoa, what's this? The delivery charge is almost as much as the couch!
Free cats do that too, y'know. {Which reminds me, if I might get a little political here, support your local animal shelter. Pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably won't die on you in a week and a half. If you want a leash, go to the pet shop. If you want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it's life. Now back to regularly scheduled programming.}
Let me finish, okay? She started kissing me and-and I didn't stop it. I guess I-I just wasn't thinking...
Eh, 'cause I knew that if I told you, you'd make me go, and I knew you needed someone to be with you tonight. Come on. Come on.
It's not like we don't know how to party!!
Okay!! Okay!!
Pheebs, I have studied evolution my entire adult life. Ok, I can tell you, we have collected fossils from all over the world that actually show the evolution of different species, ok? You can literally see them evolving through time.
Oh.
Anyone else? Huh? Bring 'em on!
Was there...uh, huh, huh, huh... andybody, anybody else there.
Dude, we got to talk.
No.
All right. A room. A man enters, he looks suspicious. That's it? Joey, you're supposed to have five pages done by now! Including an exciting incident! And what is, and what is all this?! The official rulebook of Fireball.
Until we start to look very small.
They're not a couple!
Oh man! I want that place so much!! I was so sure that was gonna work! There's twelve bucks I'll never see again!
No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me?
Ross has the blender! Ugh, everything's just falling apart!
Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn't say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.
Listen, Roland Chang, if things go well, I'm gonna be out with her all night.
I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry. I wa-I was disgusted with myself, and this morning I was so, I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy, and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible.
Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything..ahh...
It's not a club.
My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. You guys probably wanna get some hugs in too, huh? Big news!
Phoebe?
Ah-ha, nowhere to run!
Hmph. So what you, you tell each other everything?
Ah! Well uh-uh, t-take it downstairs, y'know give it a test ride.
Great! Uh, let me take this up for you.
Whoo!
She lent me an egg once.
Oh yeah, we're uh, yeah we're not together.
The necklace I got you was gold, this one is silver.
That's okay Rach, we're not liking Ross right now.
Okay. So well I'll umm, I'll have her home by midnight.
Whoa, hey! What are doing? Trying to get me drunk?
I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!
So uh, Rach? Does it, does it feel weird around here now? Y'know since I've been away at college.
This is helping your career?! Huh? I thought you wanted to be an actor not the creator of crazy lawsuit game!
I'm done.
Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch. Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y'know what I see, I see-I see division. Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, "My God why?!" Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath. I'm Ross! I'm divorced, and I have a kid!
Hi, welcome, to an adult conversation.
The ride broke down. So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom.
Alright, I've gotta go. C'mon, Marcel! C'mon! We're gonna go take a bath. Yes we are, aren't we? Yes, we are.
I mean, I, I-I admit I-I wasn't quite there. Y'know, I mean the thought of you and that-that Josh guy...
Alright, shall we?
Really?! We are?
You're not his godfather.
Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me. I'm sorry.
And so do I.
Oo-oo!
Scotch. Alright, I'll be back in 10 seconds with your scotch on the rocks in a glass.
Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a...
Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.
And you didn't marry him because...?
Go? Why?
MY SANDWICH!!!!!!
Oh come on! That's-that's... true.
No, no, really, I've got to take the car back anyway, I'm spending all day tomorrow with Ben, It's fine, no guilt I promise.
Oh yeah it will! Come on, up! Up-up-up! Up! Yes! Here we go! Pivot! Pivot! Piv-ot! Piv-et!! Piv-ett!!! Piv-et!
Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I die. She made no such promise.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!
Yeah, yeah. Y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I don't miss Marcel any more!
How 'bout from now on we just call it the 'unfortunate incident'? Hey Gunther, you got stairs in your place?
So don't, I don't see why we have to go to this thing anyway, it's your ex-fiancee's wedding.
I don't think so. Hello? When you get in there...
Good for you.
Thanks man.
You're gonna be an aunt.
Ohhhh...
Thank you.
Shoot.
Oh, see from where I was sitting I uh. . .
I know.
Buddy, my monkey, my monkey.
Excuse me. Hi, I'm a professor here. Do you know the Paleontology section, fifth floor, stack 437?
Oh no-no, after you. Oh my God!
We've got presents!
Oh you do, do you?
Oh, okay. What-what about?
Come on Pheebs, it's not that bad! Y'know most people would be excited if they didn't have to work for a couple of weeks.
Chloe? Hi..
So honey, this morning was fun, huh? Me hopping in on you in the shower there.
You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you.
Fine.
Well, ya know, they're a little behind the times in Colonial Williamsburg.
Is that supposed to be an insult?
What?
Ooh, Ooh.
C'mon kid, let's go.
This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole "We were on a break thing?" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me?
Y'know what would cheer you up?
You don't-you don't want to hear about my dream Officer...Pretty?
Breathe.
No the man's right, that's what I had with Rachel.
Ugh, she's saying good-bye to her uncle.
Well I had a great time! Umm, Chancy on the other hand...
I'm-I'm not kidding. Look I-I, I can't have three failed marriages. I can't. Okay? I-I am not gonna be that guy!
Happy birthday!!!
Uhh, not much. You guys want to see a movie tonight?
Split it?
What?! What?!
Oh come on! Here we go! Stand by for mission countdown!
What happened?
Petty...
So uh, where's Monica?
Hi.
I'm sorry your husband cheated on you.
Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands...
Dude!
Oh, hi Chloe.
Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to bond to that part?
Well, Emily's willing to work on the relationship.
Thank you. So did you ah, did you tell Mark Something about me?
Rach, I got a message from you.
It's my joke.
I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to...
He gave me a pill for it.
Women tell each other everything. Did you know that?
I have been down in your store for twenty minutes trying to get a tie! What do I have to do to get some service?! Hi Rach.
Buddy, my monkey?
Is this what you had in mind?
Wha, OK, I'm sorry, let's uh, why don't we find someplace else.
Sure! Hey, I just found out, I get Ben for the holidays this year.
Oh yeah! So ah, kinda pretty, pretty good. He sounds like a nice, good guy.
Hello to the rest.
Yeah! I don't know. I mean, last year Elizabeth now-now this kid. What-what-what-what is it?! Am I giving out some kind of...sexy professor vibe?
Y'know your probably not allowed to sleep with any of your students.
Bummer.
It's not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than I...
Please be kidding.
Good, so everybody's here. Everybody's good. So, were you gonna play something, Phoebe?
Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.
Hey, so uh, y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about?
Sorry.
Hey! So, uhh, Amanda just-just dropped me off. Yeah, that's one of the things I love about her, she's...uh, she's old enough to drive. So uhh, I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?
Phoebe! You're note, amazing! Not only did no one touch my sandwich, but people at work are actually afraid of me. Yeah, a guy called me mental! Mental Geller, yeah, I always wanted a cool nickname like that.
No, but it's-it's-it's hot!
Mmmm.
Look, look I'm sorry. It's just that....
A-A day.
Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend.
No! No! It would be weird if we were still in that place, I mean are you still in that place?
Stupid balls are in the way.
Oh my God!
Can we please focus here, a naked man's life hangs in the balance!
What? It's, it's just a phase.
Rach, come on, open up. Rach, come on, come on, Rach. You got to give me another chance.
I'm giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night, I think you should come.
Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak...out. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you.
Hey, here's a theme: Come on in, live like bacon.
Okay.
Hey!
Hey, hey, woah, you want some of this, huh? You want a piece of this, huh? I'm standin here, huh.
Nothing, ah there was this thing at the museum. Come on. Easy.
I hate America! When I finish this game, I swear I am moving.
Blah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blaaaaaah....
Okay, come on! All right, I gotta go! So good luck at the party. Okay?
No, no, that's funny. But maybe it's time to move on, let it go, y'know? Stop it! Besides, Rachel is going out with Elizabeth's father, so ah, he's much older than she is. Looks like I'm not the only one interested in fossils, huh?
Thanks. What photo album was it?
It's called the Bapstein-King comet, okay? Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer!
Yeah well if, if, if Mark said that, than Mark's an idiot.
What?!
Emily is...incredible. I mean there-there are no words to describe it, I mean the whole weekend was like a dream. Oh! And you! Rach!
Right. I guess, I guess I should call Emily.
Why, why, why would you dream that?
I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
Ohh, these are pretty good.
Yeah, c'mon I mean I though, you know, I thought we're just foolin' around. Like when, uh, when we were kids.
Can I, can I help you with something?
Yep.
What, the word hi?
You all right?
MY SANDWICH?!!!
No, no, we won't.
No, I-I-I'm serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y'know you break up!
Hey.
Wha-, oh, quit it.
Okay, please-please Paul, just let me explain...
Okay. Honey?
Thanks. Oh! So for tomorrow, do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?
Good, 'cause I love you.
Pffhah.
Come on that's not fair! I mean you haven't even heard me play!
That's right! That's right! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat so the pee goes everywhere!
Yeah, yeah man don't do it. I mean if you date her, then-then-then I can't date her.
Yeah.
Okay.
Hi. Uh, I have been in the bathroom. Stay clear of the salmon mousse.
I know! Anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer! I mean it's temporary, but uh, if they like me it could lead to a full time job. How great would that look great on a mailbox, huh? "Professor Geller."
What? What's on your shoulder?
Oh, thanks Gunther. STUPID BRITISH SNACK FOOD!!!!!!!
Well, that makes sense.
What're you doing?
Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.
I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice. I'm the one who's making things change, so I should be the one to y'know, step back.
What?! What?!
I was just thinking. When my time comes-
Monica, Monica, your guest are turning into jerky, OK.
You, you sure you need shoes? Okay.
What is this?!
No! Hey! Hey! We can't!
Oh, hey, Gunther, check this out.
Yeah-uh-huh. Tomorrow night, Valentine's Day, the most romantic day of the year. Who knows what could happen? I might not be shutting my drapes to show her my slides, if you know what I mean.
What's going on?
What?
What? Ow!
I've got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women, never thought I would be divorcing you.
I don't know what to do. What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare.
You-you-you-you threw my sandwich away!
Oh, you have some studying to do?
Look let's not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time thing. It doesn't even matter!
Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue.
Oh, no, no, no, it's-it's not the lecture ah, I mind, umm....
What?
From you? Yes, please!
No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?!
Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.
So you two are really serious?!
Are you're hands still wet?
Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing it. Do you wanna?
Okay, each team will answer ten questions. The first team that answers the most questions wins. Okay, the categories are, Fears and Pet Peeves, Ancient History, Literature, and It's All Relative. Now, the coin toss to see who goes first. Okay, somebody call it this time.
Hey, what you do on your own time...
Hey Rach.
I am so over Janine. I mean, yeah, at first I thought she was hot, but now she's like OLD NEWS!
But I don't know it. What I do know is that you owe $2300 at Isn't it Chromantic.
Dr. Green. How are you?
Excuse me?
Wha? No no! Ah! All gone! So good! Maybe Chandler has some left.
Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...
What, now?
At the coffeehouse, right.
I don't know.
You're right. Yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings.
Not that it's any of your business, but we did go out.
OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
Oh-oh really?
Hey!
You look great. I, uh... I hate that.
That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
What?! No!
Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me, I just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips.
You're bleeding.
That only took me an hour.
Why- why- why would he need a blade?
I want to take my tongue... and...
No that's not what I want. Uh, I'm glad you guys were bonding but I...
Hi there. How many, how many ah, did you sell?
Stopped for a Chunky.
Okay, I did not abandon Rachel! Okay? Emily showed up at the airport! I had to go after her! I mean, I-I did what I had to do! She's my wife! Rachel is my wife! Y'know-Emily! Emily, is my wife! Man, what is that?
Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips.
I told you there was going to be sub-titles.
I know, but ahhhhhh!! I really wanna go up there and finish that kiss!
Yes! Please!
Yeah.
Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don't I have to wait a while?
All right here. Watch me execute the three 'P's of championship play. Power. Precision. and penache.
Oh, yeah, no problems. It's all taken care of.
There you go. You put on a tuxedo! Now that wasn't so scary, was it?
That's, that's Julie. Ju... Julie, Julie. Hi Julie.
Are you into crafts at all?
They kept your room for a while.
Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.
Err, right.
Joey! This is like the last commercial. You've got like ten minutes left!
Yeah.
Oh stop.
Well why not?! She'll-she'll love it! It's the real thing! I got it at Pottery Barn.
Oh, you-you're-you're one to talk.
KARL!
If only he were a woman.
30 seconds on the clock. 5 questions wins the game. The lightning round begins...now! What is Joey's favorite food?
Oh, no! No-no! No, I tired! But I couldn't. That's why I'm here. Maybe we could attack them together? That-that's a no.
Oh, you're right, I'm sorry.
I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?
Okay.
15? Your personal best!
No.
I know, why not?
Okay. But not about this!
Joey, you are gonna love this guy. Gandolf is like the party wizard!
We're sorry.
Yeah.
What?
What? No! No, I'm not stopping. I'm Red Ross!
Okay! Okay! But if she doesn't call, it is definitely over! No, wait. Wait. Unless, eventually, I call her, y'know just to she what's going on, and, and she says she'll call me back, but then she doesn't. Then it's over.
Okay, I gotta go.
Hey!
I can't, I can't even believe her! No, y'know what, I am, I am gonna go!
Too easy? Too...The process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single-celled organisms, too easy?
Wait a minute, is this, is this for real?
What?!
Hi.
Right, they are scary. Ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand!!!
One.
Really?
Actually, it looks really good.
So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...
Great, actually. I'm thinking tonight, maybe the night. Yeah, I mean ah, the kids are gonna play together and then when they're asleep, I'm thinking Amanda and I break open a bottle of wine, and do a little "playing" ourselves.
Oh!
Am I?! And was it your idea to postpone the wedding?!
I will, I will find him.
How sad are we?
Huh?
Oh! Got 'em right here, check!
Yeah, yeah, just a tough day at work. A stegosaurus fell over and trapped a kid. Whoa, whoa, I know this jacket, this is, th--Fun Bobby's jacket! Where is he, what. He, he's here, isn't he?
What?!
Hi! Hi! Hi. Has umm, anyone seen Chandler?
We said it was only going to be two weeks, y'know?
Well pal, you didn't give me much of a choice.
These-these are beads of joy.
Wow.
Y'know what? Just-just follow my lead.
Nothing! There's nothing to do! I mean, she lives there, I live here. I mean, she-she'd have to uh, move here. She should move here!
Uh, hello!
You think?
Y'know what? I think I can take care of myself, I'll talk to you later. Good-bye. Whoa! Uh, that was your sister actually. She-she thinks that you're just using me.
Yeah, can't help but.
Oh, hey, if I make you laugh, here's an idea, why don't you invite Paulo over and have a little romp in the sack and I'll just stand in the corner and tell knock-knock jokes.
That's the day you're gonna die? See-darnit, I've got shuffleboard that day.
Shut up.
Huh. Sounds like Mark Something wants to have some sex.
Wow!
What, what is it?
No ah-ah-ah! Do not start this car! Okay! Okay! I will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now!
She said what?
...will be two months...
OK, see ya later, nice meeting you. You're welcome.
Yeah, I want my money back.
Am I! Am I! Am I out of my mind! Am I losing my senses!! This dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend out for a meal.
The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game.
Huh?
Wow! I have never had such a healthy break-up! She was such a grown-up about it! She didn't seem too immature for me! Did I just make a huge mistake?
Yeah!
Oh, great. It's starting to rain, that will make it easy to get a cab.
Well we just wanted to stop by and uh, say goodnight.
Yeah!
I, I don't know, it's got all this stuff about wind and trees and there's some kind of sacred pool in it. I mean, I don't really get it but she's, she's pretty upset about it.
Yeah.
But, you are.
No, but ah, there's coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes. I tell you what, I'll put you down for eight boxes, one for each night.
Oh My God, she-she made half a English Trifle, and half a...Sheperd's Pie!
??? Thro up a thro thro--a thro thro!
Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-
Yeah.
I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there.
Laugh it up, but the joke's on you. Because we don't need to get divorced, okay? We we're just gonna get an annulment.
Yeah, hi, I was just beeped. No, Andr is not here. Third time today. Yes, I'm sure... No, sir. I don't perform those kind of services.
Thanks you guys.
No. No, y'know you don't, you don't wear enough of this. What?
Yeah, I uh, totally forgot about that. You mind if I take a rain check? I'm waiting for a call from Emily.
Oh, I-I don't think there's any trail.
Ah, that's okay, thanks.
Oooooh.
Go ahead, go ahead with the bird. Ok, do you have anything for around 200?
Divorced men's club.
Humm, that sounds, I don't, perfect.
Oh great! We're going out again Saturday. But I just found she's also seeing some other guy.
No really, I mean, I mean, God, I could use a friend.
Yes, and that's why we're here.
Gunther. Hey-hey! Why don't we put them on? Y'know get a picture of Batman and James Bond together.
Okay, good-good for you.
Hey, Rach, you know what? I think, I think I know what'll make you feel better. How 'bout you make a list about me.
And why exactly would I do that?
Yeah.
Okay, good stuff. Umm, well she's-she's sweet and pretty and...
Well maybe he'll get to go soon, like on a class trip or something.
Well, can you blame her?
Ohh, I don't think so.
Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?
Or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans. He does that every week too.
Just one uh, one additional relationship thought. Probably something your already familiar with, uh, women talk!
Hey!
Oh, I'll-I'll come hug you.
Yeah.
Yeah and he didn't really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed he meant you.
You were trying to eat it!
Hey, y'know what? Not all spring breaks are like that.
She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.
Yeah.
Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but I'm having my lunch at this table, here in the middle. I'm having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if he'll sit with me.
That's all right, we-we don't need you. In fact, hey I'm over it already.
There's an image.
Let's show 'em.
Who?
You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
Yes.
You kissed her.
Got me.
Uh, huh. Yeah, right after I thank everyone for giving money to the museum, I sing a song about the wonder that is Joey.
Yeah.
Well...In-in case of emergency.
I can't believe this.
No, 19.
Hey. Oh, I'm sorry, this is Cailin.
Hello. Oh hi, are you on your way ove-. Oh. No, no, I, I understand, I mean a monkey's gotta work. No it, it's no big deal, it' not like I uh, had anything special planned. Yeah OK, OK. OK, OK, bye.
Uh, I'm sorry, you don't understand, I'm, I'm, I'm a friend of his. We uh, we used to live together.
Okay, I think I might know why my parents don't like you.
Uh, everyone, this is Chandler! My roommate and lead singer of our band!
Hi.
Okay... okay, maybe I will...
I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to wish you a Merry Christmas!
What?! Chandler she's our cousin!
Hi!
Hey guys.
Oh no! Hey-hey, I'm the guy! I'll get it.
What is Monica's biggest pet peeve?
I don't know what to say, I'm sorry. Though, you're not supposed to take these. It's like a million years old, we, we actually, we had people looking for that.
That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him.
No, no, no, no, no, no, not out of that, not out of clothes.
I don't know, umm...
Well, if-if she thought they were on a break...
Oh no. Don't, don't, don't start packing. Come on!
Excuse me?
With mealworms.
Oh come on. It's cold, it's dark, he doesn't know the Village. And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey, and a broken foot! Thank you very much.
We have 8:00 reservations at Grammercy Bistero.
What are you doing?
All right Pheebs, your cab's ready.
Oh thank you. Thanks very much. Ow!
Tony?
Okay, that's a fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Don't you realise none of this would've ever happened if I didn't think at that same moment you weren't having sex with Mark?
73! 72! 71!
See what? I don't know what she sees in... innn that goober. And it takes him, what? Like... like... I don't know, uhh... uhhh, hello.... a... week, to get out a sentence.
Yeah, it's-it's tough being single. That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it.
Hi. It's nice to meet you. I used to have a friend named Joey. I don't anymore.
Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!
No, we're not.
Gunther have you uh, have you seen Chandler?
Yes, yes I am. Are you a, uh, a friend of Rachel's?
Yes, yes it is! No, but it's good it's-Emily thinks we should get all new stuff. Stuff that's just ours, together. Y'know brand new.
Yay!
Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don't you think you could at least hear the guy out?
Oh Donald that-that would be great. I am totally ready to come back to work. I-What? No! Wh... What are you doing?!! GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What?
Doubtful.
Oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'Read 'em and weep.'
Oh man, this is hilarious.
Hmmm. Oh, no, no, I just thinking about something funny I heard today. Umm, Mark, Mark saying 'I'll see you Saturday.'
Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now.
This is weird for me!
Yeah but, you know, now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever seen Fun Bobby without a... a drink in his hand.
That would be me.
Wow, cool poster. Or should I say groovy poster? So, ahh, where were we?
Oh my God!
What, uh... what were you thinking?
Ohh! Ohh! In college, Chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm!
And so now you guys are gonna be married?
Remember? You-you were eating pizza.
I wanted this to work so much. I mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you back.
Yes! Yes! Yes!!
C'mon Rachel.
Oh-oh, hitting me where it hurts, my ski skills.
What?
Okay, so it wasn't uh, a traditional massage. But I did give him accu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. And, and I gently exfoliated him with, with a mop.
Actually, it wasn't that close.
Mark is that ah, the same Mark that helped you get the job?
I didn't get a cat.
Okay Ben, Santa has to go. Say good-bye!
Sweetie, you gotta relax. Everything's gonna be great, okay? Come on. Come on.
Oh-oh, you're-you're fellow scholars. What exactly were you looking for, hmm? Perhaps, perhaps Dr. Chester Stock's musings on the Smiledon Californicus?
I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist!
It's a clown kit! Clown kit!
Okay. You can feel all the bones in your skull.
This isn't what I ordered! Man! Can anything go right in my life?! First my marriage falls apart and then...
You know what, you guys, we don't have to watch this.
Yeah.
Elizabeth! Okay. Okay. I'm gonna go out this window. I'll meet you at the front door. Just tell them you're going home, okay?
Monica did it?
Yeah, I know, I uh, I tried them on.
You're back.
What?
Great. He's doing great. Don't you worry about Chandler.
All the time?
So, then you can stay as long as you want.
Okay, I didn't know you would say that.
Lift!! And slide!
What?
Oh, you're...
Hello? Hi.
Oh, please. Sweetie it's hopeless, okay, I'm just gonna go.
All right, maybe it means that too...
Hey! Look who's back! It's the birthday girl! How's the birthday girl feeling?
Yes! That's where we realized we were both super cool people!
Yeah, she's fired.
Marcel, c'mere, c'mere. Well buddy, this is it. There's just a coupla things I want to say. I'm really gonna miss you, and I'm never gonna forget about you. You've been more than just a pet to me, you've been more like a be- Okay, Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! Marcel, would- okay, just take him away. Just take him.
Okay.
No!
Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.
What?
Thank you.
Ok, dinner's on.
Well, yeah.
No!
Nah.
What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.
One more time, "Hey, don't you want a washboard stomach and rock hard pecs?"
I think this will be fine. Okay, vanilla milkshake, just a vanilla milkshake, with chicken bits floating in it. Cheers.
Go!
Okay, that's, that's enough.
Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets?
What?
No, Rachel doesn't want me to....
OK, now, sit. OK.
Oh sweetie, when do you think you're going to get off tonight?
It's morphin time!
Oh, you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy, we call him Hums While He Pees.
Hi. Mom. Dad.
1987, the day after Christmas, at Sean McMahon's party. I played you one of my songs, y'know Interplanetary Courtship Ritual.
Great!
Umm, say you're gonna be starving after all this moving. What do you say I take you to dinner tonight?
Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child.
Hey!
You got a tattoo?
Yeah.
Don't thank me! If you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization. Here's Warren's number.
Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...
That's right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit film...that Batman film he was in.
I wasn't- I mean, I-
I dont know whether hes testing me, or just acting out, but my monkey is out of control. But, he keeps erasing the messages on my machine, "supposedly" by accident.
I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself. Everyone's all, "Ross you have to be funny and sexy." Well, I proved them wrong! And now, I'm gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler.
What?!
...I'm telling you it's totally unconstituional.
No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.
I'm sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.
Is that funny? Am I supposed to be laughing?
Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn't work.
Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah...
Oh great! That means I'm stuck with, "So, we were watching you in there and you were sittin' right here! Whoa!"
Really?! Wow! That's-that's so nice, what are you gonna get me?
Yes. Yes. Don't worry. Everything's fine. We'll uh, we'll see you tomorrow at the wedding.
Look, I don't care it starts at eight, we can't be late.
Right! So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery! What he believed to be igneous, was in fact sedimentary. Imagine his consternation when- Oh bloody hell.
You don't have a valid driver's license-Okay that is it! Pull over right now!
I am really not going. I don't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married?
Right.
Ok, ok, sweetheart, I'll see you later. Ok, bye. What? Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three. Well you didn't hang up either.
Yes!! I knew it!! Bye-bye! So long! Later!
You're right. That's very different. So let's, let's just sign the papers. All right? What?
Gimme this.
Twice.
I just wanna check something.
Yeah.
GIVE ME MY PUCK!!
Okay.
Would it matter?
Hey, hey buddy, Marcel. Marcel. In the jungle, the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight. In the jungle, the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight. a-weema-way, a-weema-way.....
Oh, Emily that is, that is so great. It's gonna be so great! We're gonna be like-like-like two idiots in love!
No, a car backfired, but I thought somebody was taking a shot at me. And Rach, I...I survived! And I was filled with this-this great respect for life. Y'know? I-I want to experience every moment. I want to seize every opportunity. I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now.
All right! You go get him! Let's go!
Take from me, as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to say the right name.
Hey Rach, can I talk to you outside for a second?
Hey!
I'll take that dad.
Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and y'know fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles...
Ok, do you have any ideas for any openers?
Hey, y'know what's weird? After you guys get married, when you introduce me to people you're gonna have to say, "This is my brother-in-law Ross." Not, "My friend Ross," "brother-in-law Ross." That's weird isn't it?
I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
Okay, wish me luck.
Oh no, I have plans with Elizabeth.
Mmm. Oh, no-
Joey come-I can't believe-I bring you here to see the Bapstein-King comet, one of nature's most spectacular phenomenon, and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman!
Phoebe, what are you doing?
Im gonna be a father.
Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all?
Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.
Lemme see.
I didn't get the annulment.
Please tell me you're joking.
All right. Uhh, international.
Hey.
A big idiot. Just you have to realize is, this whole Mark thing is kinda hard for me.
Hey. Uh, Chan, can I uh, can I talk to you for a second?
Uh, hold, let me see, I don't know. So what're you gonna do. . .
Yeah in fact, I'm gonna go call her right now. And I'll make sure to tell her my friend Chandler says...
Why are you laughing?
Yeah, which was nice.
He's taking her purse!
Y'know what, y'know what, I'm-I'm not the one that wanted that, that break, okay. You're the one that bailed on us. You're the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough!
Hiiii-Ya!! I'm serious! You're not walking out on my sister!
I dunno, there's just something about...
Oh my God! Rach-Rach, are-are-are you sure?
That's, that's nice twice!
That's okay, Joe.
Hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. Cause when you have to move back in with Joey, Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me.
Fascinating.
Oh, all right. Tails! Can you-can you see what it is?
Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben but I-I will figure something out. Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?
You're welcome.
Cannot feel my tounge.
No. Your mother really did the work. I was busy with the business. I wasn't around that much. Is that what this is about?
Woooo!!!
All right, I'm coming out. Hey, can you turn the lights off.
Phoebe, why'd you do it?
Good.
Phoebe!
He won't? He won't! Because, isn't that, isn't that the, the short story you were writing?
Is it? Feels like two.
Fine, OK! Heat, heat, heat, and I'm the obsessive one. OK, this way is on, so this is. . . off.
Oh, it's my new beeper.
Okay.
Yeah? How'd it go?
Well, I'd love to! Here, you wait right here and I'll go get the projector and my notes!
Hey!
Er.... um.....
It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?
Yeah. Ya know, a boy and a girl. Hopefully the girl will come first so Ben here won't feel too competitive.
Not at the concert.
Marcel?
Goodnight.
No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me!
They're still, they're still not coming on man and the lotion and the powder have made a paste!
Okay, now just remember everything I taught you and you'll be fine. Okay? Here we go. Ready...Set...
Ooooohhhh.
I can't believe it. Can I tell you something? I'm a little mad at him now.
Yep?
Uh yeah, I guess-Yeah! I guess so.
I know.
Phoebe, you can't get out of this! Okay? You have to learn how to ride a bike!
Alright.
My God Monica!!
Thanks! Ugh, I can't believe you're not gonna be there!
No. No. Nothing happened. I shut the drapes to uh, show her slides of my favorite fossils.
No-no-no, no, umm, actually American surprise parties are-are-are very short. It's usually, "Surprise!" And then, "Oh my God, I'm so surprised-good-bye!"
Oh wait-hold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.
Yeah!
I was talking to myself! You're going down!
Okay, I'm gonna play my sperm card one more time.
Tell me about it. So what, what's your magic number?
Chandler, I want you to run a post pattern to the left, okay. And sweetie..
Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They're mean and they're stupid and-and I don't want my son learning them!
Everything okay in there?
Y'know, y'know I'm lookin' and I don't think anyone's home here. I say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and y'know explain later.
Come on!
Let's not talk about losing. Just deal the...
A little. Yeah. I made a snack.
Five letters.
No.
What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?
Oh. Hey, who's Carl?
Well, I'm just saying, I mean why else would he just, y'know, swoop in out of nowhere for no reason.
Guess who?
Dad that won't matter to her. Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all her is-is, is growing new stuff! See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.
Okay, hold my crawler.
No.
Uh-huh, I see that.
What kind of research?
No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird.
Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe goind into the robot, y'know?
Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you?
Oh, no-no-no don't you worry about me falling asleep. I still have your letter!!!
It just amazes me that your still pulling stuff like this.
No, no, no I don't want to know, don't want to know. Ok, you know, I should probably, I should probably just go.
We're fine, we're fine.
Oh God, thank you! Umm, uh, Mr. Stevens I'd like you to meet my friends uh, this is Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler.
I'm having... I'm having a baby. I'm having a... Where's the phone? The phone?
Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm.
I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
Really?
Bye!
Oh, just this woman that I met last night at the party.
See, I see.... big passion in your future.
Emily, hi! Uh, how-how was you flight?
Okay, okay. Look, you have got to go to a doctor! Okay?
No look I wasn''t right, that's what I came here to tell you. I was totally hung up on, on my own stuff. Listen, I'm someone who needs the whole security thing, ya know. To know exactly where my next paycheck is coming from buy you, you don't need that and that's amazing to me. I could never do what you do Joey.
I want my turkey now!
Okay, maybe it wasn't my best decision. But I just couldn't face another failed marriage.
What's up?
Home is Home Star stew.
So do I. Okay Rach, before anything happens I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules. This is just about tonight. I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of "Us." Okay? I just want this to be about what it is!
I know.
I will be! Listen, I don't want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?
Hey, tell Dan, 'Thanks.'
All right.
Play it.
Can't do it, can you?
Okay. You uh, you wanna hear something weird?
Let me see, I gotta see, I gotta see. Oh, a head. Oh, it's, it's huge. Carol, how are you doing this?
No, I, I only know Lipson.
Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid. I mean look at him, look at you,
No really, I mean, I mean, God, I could use a friend.
Don't sweat it, I've got this section covered. Yeah, in fact I've got this little baby to shine in people's eye--Okay, see you later.
The flirting! Aren't you supposed to be going out with, I don't know hmm, let's say my sister?!
There you go. So she dips into her savings, that's what it's there for. She's gonna be fine, and if you need a little extra, you know where to find it.
Nice. And by the way that uh, that line down my face?
Yes I would.
Hello.
Hey! It's 42-21!
That'll be a neat trick, when you're, when you're dead!
I really wish that you wouldn't.
Yeah, definitely, I'm sure you'll feel totally different when it's our baby.
I made fun of his accent.
Oww!
Okay. Okay. Okay.
Oh, I was unbelievable.
I tell you one thing, I wouldn't mind having a piece of this sun-dried tomato business. Five years ago, if somebody had said to me, here's a tomato that looks like a prune, I'd say "get out of my office!"
Hi guys.
I'll take it. My gift to you man.
Phoebe really likes the bike huh?
Challenge excepted.
OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning...
You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
Excuse me, do any of you know how to play?
Correct. In what part of her body did Monica get a pencil stuck at age 14?
It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again.
Yeah?
Y'know-thanks!
Come on, Rachel, come on! Talk to me! Please!!
Hey! Oh, we-we can't keep eating like this.
Ohh! A man with a plan!
So how'd it go?
Listen, I got to tell you I've-I've never been to a guru before, so...
Hey hold on, hold on. How much for the uh, how much to save the bird?
How's Monica coming along with her vows?
No! No! No! The "Come here to me" is y'know for the ladies.
Yeah!!
I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right.
Anyone want me to appraise anything?
Is uh, is Monica here?
Dad, I beg you not to finish that sentence.
Uh no-no, she-she's out for the night.
Hey I'm sorry to do this to you again but uh, is there any way you can look after Ben for a little bit? I-I've got this meeting at school. And-and he-he asked for his uh, 'Fun Aunt' Rachel, so...
So do you have like any nuclear weapons on board?
Oh hey, that was a good one, huh? Help! Help!
Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?
Pheebs, what about you?
Then where the hell have you been?!
Rachel?
Hey!
Oh, now you can exchange them if you want, ok.
And listen, man, if you wanna be gay, be gay. Doesn't matter to me.
Like buddies.
C'mon Rich, it's my birthday, let me live vicariously.
Look, I'm not being any of those things, ok, I'm just being realistic.
Noo.
Hey! Hey, look! Ugly Naked Guy's back!
Okay, okay, what's going on?
Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the Happy Days gang.
Dollars? You spent $1200 dollars on a plastic bird?
Dad, dad I don't want to hear about it.
Yeah, laugh all you want but in ten minutes we're gonna have younger looking skin!
Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part. Helloo!
This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.
My God!
Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.
What?! I wh-, what's wrong?
Oh, hey y'know, they-they really overcharge you for that stuff. But who cares?! Because it's all on me! That is, one big drink!
Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.
Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy! Huh, am I having a boy?
Well, this is ironic. Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didn't want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete can't.
Yeah, yeah, what is it?
They're not listening too me?
Bye.
I can't belive you two had sex in her dream.
Then you should have said something before I met her.
Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back- come here, Marcel-
Well I'm, I'm a little slow. Just as our children would be.
I see your twenty, raise you twenty-five.
Huh? Oh-oh, it was fine. Uh, it was just a misunderstanding. She didn't want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that she's going to Florida for spring vacation.
Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?
Oh, you and me?
Hey!
Okay, I'll just wait for him in here!
Yeah? I was good at the stuff huh?
I-I'm, I'm having a boy?
Well, he had gravity boots.
Okay. Thanks you guys. Pheebs are you wearing fur?
Yes, that's what I was going to ask, thank you.
Right.
No problem.
Good.
Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me!
I bet two dollars.
Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you should start think about getting a different job.
Fine! Fine! But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here, "If you accept full responsibility..." Full responsibility! "...I can begin to trust you again. Does that seem like something you can do. Does it?!!"
Listen, I'm ah, I'm sorry I've been so crazy and jealous and, it's just that I like you a lot, so...
What?!
Bye Ben.
Yeah.
I like it, and Emily likes it, and that's what counts. So uh, how are you guys doing?
Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.
Easy.
Well, whatever it is I'm-I'm very, very sorry. Okay?
What? You forgot fourteen states?
You took my watch?
He's coming here for Thanksgiving!
Is this about Mark?
Ok. Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian.
You understand I don't actually like 8-year-old boys.
I find Marion's views far to progressionist.
Hey Pheebs, what-what was the deal with you and Chandler blowing us off before?
Well, but, but. . .
What?
Oh, I see, so everybody wins.
Hi! I'm sorry, but can you give me a second while I talk to this woman, who by the way did not spend the night.
Yes.
Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think we'll be able to find a new place for the wedding.
Where's Ben?
Oh.
That's it? You're not mad? I mean, it must've been terrible.
Okay. You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.
Practical jokes.
You come out there, you're a dead man.
I made a man twice my size cry. I mean, I haven't done that since I was four and I washed my dad's Porsche with rocks.
Uh-huh.
Emily?!
I do have a newfound respect for life.
Hey.
All right-all right, fine! I-I'm gonna call the cops!
Well, you can't know where I am all the time. Look, this marriage is never gonna work if you don't trust me.
Who?
Oh. Hel-lo!
What?
How might you be wrong?
Uh-huh. Yeah I-I have a knack for impressions.
Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there.
How's the hair?
Hey!
She wants me to move to London.
I uh, I just got back from uh, from Julie's.
Ohhh.
No, no, uh, it's not what you think. It's um the other thing.
This is Ross?
Hey, does anybody want to get some lunch? All those in favor say I?
What do you mean?
Hey, what'd you guys do to get up on there?
That's funny. Umm.... It's not funny.
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. Sorry. Sorry! Hey! Hey! I got my s's back! Which we can celebrate later. Celebrate.
I, I know it's big, I just didn't know it was uh, ha-ha big.
I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?
Oh my God!
Yeah, yeah, it'll be great! You can, you can lay on the beach and I can cry over my failed marriage. See-see how I make jokes?
So?
Well you shouldn't be. Believe me I wouldn't want to be the guy who's up against you. I mean that doofus is going to lose!
Y'know actually it does have a very interesting history. Uh, this street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system. Before that sewage and waste would just flow right down the street. Yeah, sometimes ankle deep!
Noooo.
Did homo-erectus hunt with wooden tools?
What?! Why?!
Yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. It's not just about the pictures.
Well y'know 'cause Rachel and I used to go out.
You are such a tattletale! Mom, Dad, you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana?
Okay, okay. This morning you said there was nothing so big that we couldn't work past it together...
People need juice!
Hey, I can handle it! All right?
Ah Joey, I don't think you get to pick the cities.
Four letters: "Circle or hoop".
Bye.
Of course it is. Yeah, come on in. Ooh-ooh, go by the window you can pretend to be surfing.
Hey! Hi!
It's not a library...
C'mon, what's his name?
You okay?
Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. Okay. I, uh, am from Long Island. I-I came to the city for college. Um, I, um, have a 5 year old son and in my spare time I like to read spy novels. But, but, let's talk more about you. Hmm.
No-no-no, I-I wanna play.
Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on.
I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.
Toilet paper?
Hey! Yeah-yeah, we're just having dinner. Uh, yeah, sure uh hold on. She wants to say hi. Hold on.
Hey, y'know, y'know what would make me really happy?
Sorry.
Well, I'm sorry, but ah, look if you're not working with him anymore, why do you have to still do stuff with him?
It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this.
I've said it! Okay?! But it's over Joey!
Hi!
You mean hardball?
I'm sorry, I was an idiot.
Hey!
Hootie and the--oh my. I, I can catch them on the radio.
Halftime.
Hey.
Yeah.
Well, yeah!
Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we didn't.
Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens.
Little girl misses her cat. Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat. Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her.
What?
I-I uh, I got tricked into all those things!
Two seconds...
Nooo!
Yeah-No-but-but-but-but! We're just gonna go home and take a shower. Now, that's not scary right?
I just asked that girl out.
Oh, I'm sure.
Well, I tried! But when I got to my lawyer's office all I could hear was, "Three divorces. Three divorces!" Look, I just don't want my tombstone to read, Ross Gellar, Three Divorces.
What, he gave you his home number? As in like, to, to his home?
Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!
Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n' Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.
What?
ALL RIGHT!! Phoebe now come on! Will you please tell me what it is I did that mad you so mad at me!
Okay when you're playing a machine and it hasn't paid out, a lurker waits for you to give up and then...
Oh.
So, um... where did Paolo come from?
Well, I can't say any of us were surprised. Your parents have been unhappy ever since we've known them. Especially after that incident in Hawaii.
...since I stopped trying.
Look at me!
When did I say that?
You're livin' the dream.
Okay.
The first time! No seriously, imagine if Carol hadn't realized she was a lesbian.
Okay, okay, I'll go first.
What?
Hello. Hi sweetie. Good. Look umm, yes I've been thinking about that thing that you wanted me to do and, I can do it. So will you come to New York?
Ah... Ah...Get out of here! Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marion's views on evolution?
Ok, what, what...ok, what did we think it was going to be?
You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day?
Yeah, okay.
Do you wanna start telling secrets?
Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen.
Phoebe, how could you do this to me?!
Eat your fish.
Good morning.
Oh sure, "Ross will do it!" It's not like he has a job, or a child, or a life of his own.
You know what I like most about him, though?
Only way to fly.
Peach pit.
Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes.
Spring vacation.
Hey listen I uh, talked to Chandler, sorry about the movie.
Hey!
I am dressed.
That uh, that was pretty funny. Wasn't it?
Well, I don't think we are gonna have that problem, but maybe that's just because I am not emotionally unavailable!
Kinda like a big face without skin.
Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel, yeah! About jellyfish and how if you... Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?!
Yes!! Yes!!!
Lo que sucedio es que no le gusta la tele!
A what?
Do you like it?
Hey!
Wow!
Well, now I do!!
I'm sorry Rach, it was, it was really close.
Come on, you made coffee! You can do anything!
Wha... what, here?
Okay, okay. If that is what it takes to show you how much you mean to me, and how much I want you there. Then that's what I'll do.
Oh, so-so you talked to her. Did she, did she sound mad?
Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it.
Hey Mon!
Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...
MY SANDWICH?!!!
We're not done.
What?!
You still love me.
Hello? Hey Mon, how's the packing going? Ben? He's fine. Yeah, he's right-Oh my God! Get your head of your shirt there son! What? Yeah, it's a pumpkin. I'll come pack.
...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call immigration? I could call immigration!
Oh, no, I didn't mean, uh...
Yes, yes I am. And you are a....
Hey!
You, you know I, I don't, have a- have a problem with that.
And bus.
Slides are almost ready.
What?
Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room?
Of course I was mad! I told you I-I hate this stuff! Okay? It-it's not funny!
That's right, uh, Elizabeth Hornswoggle.
Oh what?! Is she gonna cancel on me again?! How can she do this? Doesn't she know it's our anniversary?
Hi!
I mean, why not! I mean, I mean why not?!
Hey!
Well, we're all here! I guess we should get going!
There's no 'or' in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!
Monica, if you want, I can lend you some money.
It is! It is!
Hi. Where is everybody?
What?
Ugh. It's definitely getting worse.
Yay! And that takes what? Just six or seven minutes.
I'm going to do it.
Yeah. I don't know, I've been wanting this since like ninth grade typing, ya know. And I just want it to be perfect and right and. . . why isn't that laser beam cutting through the paint?
Wow, how many have you got?
But, Elizabeth and I are-are both adults and so I don't think there's really anything you can do about it.
Okay. Sure.
Emily? Emily! Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Emily! It's Emily everyone! Shush-shush-shhst! Hi!
I'd like to return this couch. I'm not satisfied with it.
Where exactly is your zoo?
Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?
: Could you take it to Carol's every now and then, and show it to Ben, just so he doesn't forget me?
Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!
Oh I, I don't-I don't think that would be the best idea.
What happened?
Grazie.
Oh, who? Me?
Someone at work ate my sandwich!
Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.
Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and I'll always remember that summer because that's when I realized that we are related.
Oh no! That-that'll just bring me down! This was great! I mean I-I-I was great! This is a great day! Y'know what? I'm buying everyone coffee. All right? If someone would just grab my wallet, it's in my pocket.
And why wouldn't he get it?
Hey, where'd you get that?
Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun..uh... I can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom.
Oh, but-but I can't do it.
Hey.
I gotta get going. Bye Chandler.
So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?
Oh, umm, I'm just getting rid of a couple of things.
Can I use.. either thumb?
Great! Because people kept showing up, I think it's like uh-a thing!
Well, it's not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the park who thought Ben was really cute--y'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning.
What? Is it the comet?
Well hey, who did these resumes for ya?
Okay, I'm working on my flirting.
Wait! No! Ben, come here! I am not kidding!
I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.
The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.
No, it's not just that. It's justI want someone who... who does something for me, y'know? Who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes me, uh...
Look, I-I'm really sorry I let go of the bike.
Let's grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.
Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, "Why not?!"
Well I'm thinking that Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy, so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her.
Wow! The only thing I got from my Grandmother was her eyes. I mean not-not her actual eyeballs, but, but people say that my eyes-Do-do you want to make out?
You and your ice.
I am a good kisser.
Oh...my...God! I-I see what this is! You are in love with Rachel!
Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.
That's, that's funny. Change!
Oh, well, I, I guess it musta been the day after you were born. We were in the hospital room, your mother was asleep, and they brought you in and gave you to me. You were this ugly little red thing, and all of a sudden you grabbed my finger with your whole fist. And you squeezed it, so tight. And that's when I knew.
Thank you.
Four.
Ssshh.
He's right, what she did was unforgivable.
OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
Come on, you-you can't tell me you actually believe that-that there's a woman inside that cat!
I sort've already asked Chandler.
This screen is amazing, I mean Dick Van Dyke is practically life-size.
Wow!
I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid.
Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
Okay, are you mad at me because my hair gel smells?
Oh yeah, why not?
Yeah? Oh-oh, she'd be so excited!
Come on guys, I-I really want this guy to like me. It-it would really help me out if you guys were here to make me look good.
Thank you!
Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away.
Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.
And she's just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little...
I missed you too.
I had just moved in. Thank you! Listen umm...
Like what?
Oh look, I can't believe this. Look, homo-habilus hasn't even learned how to use tools yet and they've got him here wi, with clay pots. Why don't, why don't they just give him a microwave? I'm sorry, I'm sorry this is taking so long, ya know, I, I, it's just it's longer than I expected, we will have dinner.
Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.
Yeah.
Who the hell is Jordie?
My nana used to do it. That's how she paid for all my dance-karate lessons.
What?!
Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few hours, some kids messed up the Homo Sapien display.
What is ah, Rach in her room?
Phoebe, I told her you already knew.
Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing.
I'm sorry.
Hey!
Excellent!
Done! With time a-to-spare.
Hey!
How are you ever going to sell this place?
I got it.
Okay, y'know how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage?
Oh thanks!
Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me.... a-sucks.
What's a matter with me? You've got a black light. It's 1999!
Okay. Yeah, I guess, I guess I could do that too.
Oh-oh, absolutely!
How much did you pay for that?
Hello?
Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought I'd have to talk you into this more.
Is everything okay?
No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second. That's my friend's machine.
I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.
That-that's always good news. Are you okay?
I'm here. How's my little boy? Want Daddy to change your diaper? So, did you have fun with Uncle Joey and Uncle Chandler today?
That's true, thanks dad. People should be dancing! Huh? Hey, this is a party! Come on! Joey, dance!!
Uh, what you said, about us being in a place where we could finally be happy for each other.
Yeah, well my-my ex-wife and I share custody of Ben and umm, uh, and just so you know, Carol and I are on excellent terms as I'm sure you are with your wife! Oh, I'm sorry! It's unbelievable!
We're here!
I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while.
Fine by me; hope she wins.
C'mon.
What do you mean?
C'mon, it's my birthday.
No, you, ya know there's no need to make it u. . . how?
What?!
Oh-ho please. Ask her how?
Are you sure she's in the cat, or have you been taking your grandma's glycoma medicine again?
Pheebs, what are you doing?
Cassie?
That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! Oh, let's see now he had the trampoline.
Hi! Yeah! Tommy's in line for the bathroom and someone just cut in front of him, I think he's gonna snap.
Mmm.
Oh yeah! Batch 17 was good. I did not like batch 16. I'm okay.
Oh yeah, about telling Mom and Dad, I was thinking about maybe writing a letter.
Okay, where in the hell did you get that?!
Look, look, there's got to be a way we can work past this. Okay, I can't imagine, I can't imagine my life without you. Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart. Your good heart Rach, and, and....
Look I've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one!
Okay. Hut! Hike!
'I am Bea. I drink tea. Won't you dance around with....' Ohhh!
That! Let's talk about that.
Hey!
No see now, now I can't because uh, I'm feeling too self conscious.
Hey Rachel.
Hop in. Get ready for the smoothest ride of your life.
You really serve people sneezers?
You know what, you guys, we don't have to watch this.
Uh, yeah, I'll take a coffee. Thanks, man.
Ok, sweetheart, I'll call you later tonight. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey, you're not really gonna go through with this, are you?
Here she comes. Don't say a word, okay? Just be cool, don't be...y'know you.
Oh really, really great! Yeah! A-actually she's right down the street, umm, do-do you know what? You should stop bye and say hi.
I... I don't know what you are talking about.
Hey, I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
Hi.
Oh my God!
The button, the button.
C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch...
Oh I'm, I'm making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do.
I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing the flying nun.
Amazing!
Huh, what's fish hooking... Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?
Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen.
Hey! Hey! If he's moving, maybe I should try to get his place!
All right, you know that one was coming, but that doesn't mean you have unagi.
How could you tell her?!
Hey!
...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him.
Yeah! Rach?
Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there's a bug in my food.
That would be nice.
I don't know, I could maybe go out for a couple of beers, but there's this thing about bumblebees on The Discovery Channel that I was planning to watch.
Yeah. Yeah, oh you loved that thing. You always had it with you. You never went anywhere without-without that coloring book.
Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!
Kristen Lang.
No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back.
Hi Gunther.
Ni-chou chi-ma!
Well I'm sorry but you were! Okay? And besides if anyone should be hitting on her it's the guy who's single, the guy that who-who-who can do something about it.
She looks so small.
That cup is mine!
Wh-Hey-Whoa-whoa, where, where you going?!
Wait! It was my plan.
Oh.
I got some, uh, hers and hers towels for Susan and Carol. And, uh, I got this blouse for mom.
You complete me kitchen, matey!
You don't want to believe me, I'm Mr. Funny to you. Mr. Funny...
Yeah, I-I really do. Hey! This-this was a gift?!
Um, no, I uh, I have done it before.
Ok. I'll see ya later. Just think about it, ok.
Well...
Maybe that will liven up this party.
Okay, so, do you make the pizzas in one of those uh, wood-burning ovens?
Okay! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think, forget about the whole three divorce thing! Okay, I-I'll go to my lawyer's office right now and get this marriage annulled! Okay?! Because she means nothing to me! Noth--Nothing!!
He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...
Happy for you.
Well, Chandler and I are in a bar...
"Heating device."
Every week, the TV Guide comes to Chandler and Joey's apartment. What name appears on the address label?
Let's, let's take this outside? Who talks like that?
Well Mr. Big Shot is better than 'wethead'.
Yeah!!
That, that's the only thing the zoo's ever told me.
Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say...
Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask?
"...subcategories. The first of these subcategories is..."
Oh hey, don't thank me, thank yourself. You're the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them.
Bye.
Yeah, ever since you uh, told me that story about that bike I-I couldn't stop thinking about it. I mean, everyone should have a-a first bike, so...
Yeah?
Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us. And so I uh, hah-hah, I just heave it down field.
Once Monica was sent to her room without dinner, so she ate the macaroni off a jewelry box she'd made.
Thanks, man, big help.
Pass it! Pass it!
Hello, it's us, all right? It'll be fine.
W-What was the one right before bananas?
I don't know. What's in this pie?
Whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet.
Yeah!
Joey, you look nothing like Ben.
All right, there you go!
Oh please! You're gonna say things now, aren't ya?
You're drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe I'm a little drunk.
What?
What? No-no, a lurker.
Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it.
...How long was I in there?
...Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Rachel! I'll just call her back.
Sorry.
Do you say this stuff to girls?
Good. Maybe he can switch it back.
Open up. We want to talk to you.
No. Man I don't wanna have to have Joey with me every time I wanna descent cup of coffee. Ya know, and I don't wanna spend the rest of my life drinking cappucino with a 'K'. I say you and I go back down there and stand up to those guys.
What?
I don't know, I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out.
Okay here we are Paul, Elizabeth. So I hope you guys were finding something to talk about.
Hmm? Oh, yeah.
Oh well. It probably would've been the most constructive solution.
Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was like hilarious. So I'm gonna show her how tough I really am!
Oh OK. Well then why don't you, uhh, why don't you borrow it from mom and dad? You feel guilty and tense around them already. You might as well make some money off of them.
No, no he's not.
Baking it didn't help, huh?
Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch.
No?
No.
OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?
Mee mee, mee-mee mee.
There was just an explosion, okay? My hearing would be impaired.
Thanks.
Oh, come here sweetie, listen, you're gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job. That's not how that was supposed to come out.
Oh yeah! Wasn't she uh...
You got ink on your lip.
Hi, Pheebs!
All right.
Just a sandwich? Look, I am 30 years old, I'm about to be divorced twice and I just got evicted! That sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life! Someone ate the only good thing going on in my life!
Hhhiiii.
Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.
Well, uh, do you have a Santa-outfit left?
No you don't.
Look, I don't feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?
That's right, I.. 'cause I didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment!
Yeah, were better off without them.
It is off.
All right Emily, as much as I love you, I'm sorry, I can't move to London without Ben.
Oh, I'm just over here with Ben. I thought we'd say hi.
Okay!
Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night? Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!!
Monica knows.
I'm good.
Wow! Great! Wait, dad who-who's cigarettes are these?
Well... not in the same way...
Yeah?
Well I uh, I skipped forth grade.
Well for starters, you may want to light it and lose the spatula.
It's heads. Gentlemen, pick your category.
Everything? Even the TV?
I- I- I ca- I can't believe this. I mean, all I asked you to do was keep him in the apartment.
Look, you wanna get off my back?
Yeah, okay, hold on! They're not coming on man.
Okay Rach, but...
What??
I do too! I do too!
I'm going to the bathroom.
Oh, I thought it was just a kid yelling, "I'm gay! I'm gay!" Can I bring her in?
Well, not playing raquetball!
Sweetie, now I pick you.
That's okay.
Okay.
Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?
Help! Help!! Help! Help!!
So, I got us some reservations for Sunday night, okay? How about, Ernie's at 9 o'clock?
Yeah.
Monica bang! Monica bang! Ow!
Yeah, listen...
No, you don't.
Well, yeah, of-of course I'm okay! What? I'm just being supportive. Supportive of you and this whole trip, and-and what-what is uh, what's this?
Well ah, you wanna just stay out there?
I wasn't sleeping.
Hi!
Man! They cannot get enough!
Rings?
I think we proved our point.
Helen Geller? I don't think so.
You're on!
Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple. Y'know? Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple. Y'know? You can take it off. Just slice that baby right off!
What? What?
Oh look, a low budget puppet show.
Thanks. I-I think I'm dying. I really do.
What time?
Everybody put their balloons down!!! Now this is a nice suit!!
Hey-hey have you ever locked yourself in a TV cabinet VD boy?!
Hi Jill.
Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...
I'm afraid the TV Guide comes to Chinandolor Bong.
Dude, what are you doing?
Ok.
Pheebs, you're talking about putting your body through an awful lot, I mean morning sickness, uhh, labour, and it's all for somebody else!
No Rach! Come on! No-no! Yeah, I'm sure we won't get arrested for this.
Ah well, can't blame a guy for trying!
Hey you leave Marcel out of this!
A thumb?!
So why don't you quit?
Okay.
Thank you! That's what I keep saying.
Hey!
Well, I wanted to be thorough. I mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us! And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!
Just, just, just pick one!
No, why?
Hot dog?
No! No! I...didn't do that. It's just... Okay, honestly no. I don't, I don't see a big future with her.
Uh, Rachel, I've been thinking. I don't think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. I'm calling it off.
Yeah.
Uh yeah! Let me, let me get that for you.
No, no, that's not where I was going. Er, if you get in the... way, of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very sad.
FINE BY ME!!
Look, they must be stopped!
Monica couldn't tell time 'til she was 13!
Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust.
Hey, you're not going to believe this. I made up a joke and sent it in to Playboy. They printed it!
Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket!
Can I see you for a second?
Oh my God! Rachel Green?
Gotcha.
Then what am I supposed to do?
What are you talking about?
Yes it is. See.
And what--What are you typing that for? Did you hear what she said? We don't get the annulment. Don't type that! What?! Stop typing! Hey! Stop typing! Stop typing! Stop typing!!
What's her last name?
People are doing it in front of my book!
Come on, they're gonna love you.
Damn, I forgot you were here.
Phoebe, she doesn't know that you sneak out every night, she doesn't know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesn't know that you've been living with your Grandmother's for a week now.
You still love me?
Hey, you know what I just realized? If you guys ever have kids...
Hey, would you ah, would you like some juice?
No-no, one daddy, two mommies. All right, it's all yours.
Oh no.
'Pwease, Aunt Monica, pwease?' Oh, unclench. You're not even gonna be there.
Yeah!
Sure! Here.
Oh yeah! Then how come you didn't get the Geller Cup?
Wh-what did he say?!
Sorry.
Look, I didn't think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I thought we were broken up.
Hey, when did you and Susan meet Huey Lewis?
Hi, um, Im err, Im Ross Geller, and err ah... ..thats, thats my boy in there, and uh, this is Carol Willick, and this... is Susan Bunch. Susan is um Carols, just, com... ..whos next?
So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?
Hey!
Because it's breast milk. It's gross.
Yeah?
Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I.
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. We're not 13 anymore.
Look, you'll get there. You're an amazing chef.
Oh yeah-No-You're welcome. We'll talk about it later.
Hey everybody!
Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?
Listen, I'm- I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, it's just I...
Look, I'm sorry.
No.
Thank you.
Yeah, Susan.
Hey.
Joey!!
What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way.
What?! No! No! Wait! You're right, this is stupid. Who cares what people think? I mean, I mean we like each other right? There's nothing wrong with that. Come on. Burt? Lydia? Mel? This is Elizabeth.
Rachel! What are you doing here?
Monica, come on now. Let's go, baby coming.
So uh, wha-uh, what do you do?
No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie.
Happy Thanksgiving!
How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange?
Y'see, that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian?
200 dollars.
Good, good, good. So, is uh, was your moustache, did, used to be different?
And for the record, it took two people to break up this relationship!!
Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?
Hey! What's she doing back here?
Who would you rather be Simon or Garfunkle?
Rach! Rach!
What?!!!
It's your turn.
All right, see you guys.
In this life, Phoebe.
Hi.
I'm telling you, this guy Rachel is with is crazy! Okay? He viscously screamed at total strangers! I think he's baaad news!
Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the museum.
Hi.
I know.
Joey, Homo Sapiens are people.
Oh-ooh!
Okay, see ya later.
One more day, seriously/
Hey, don't we have to...
Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore.
Not at all! I love this guy. Hey, I was so psyched to hear you're back with my sister!
All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything's kinda pink.
FINE BY ME!!
Totally.
Long story, honey.
Awwwahuh, no, no, no!!
I think it means he freaked out and left!
Come on up. I'm gonna get the rest of his stuff together.
I was their first born! They thought she was barren! It's not my fault.
Really.
Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three. Well you didn't hang up either.
Yeah, it'll be like a funny Thanksgiving story!
So um...Thanksgiving. The holiday season is upon us, hm?
I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.
Yeah.
Hi, we're visitiing. It's Ben and his da-da. Da-da. Can you say da-da? Look, I'm gonna tell your momies you said it anyway so you might as well try.
Uh actually Joey, it's the Cretasous period.
No really, I-I am! I feel bad!
You ever figure out what that thing's for?
I've seen her at work, but I always figured, ah-huh? But, uh, I made her dinner. We had a great time. And we're going out again tomorrow.
Of course, what happened?
Hmm?
What? What? What? What is it?
Ah, somebody's at the door on the ceiling.
Oh, actually I haven't even been home yet. Do you mind if I check my messages?
Check it out, he actually is the MonkeyShine monkey.
Yeah, I kind of uh, have something else planned for you guys.
That, that is funny. That is painfully funny. No, wait. Wait, yeah, that's just painful
What? You have a date? Who with?
Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?
Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily, honey, okay?
Helps a little.
No, that's fine.
As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, until death parts us. Really, I do. Emily.
Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?
Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.
Joey, please!
I don't have too. I can just look at you.
Please. This is so your fault.
What?!
Just a smidge.
Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...
Did you say something?
You go get 'em. What did I do to you? Did I hurt you in some way?
Chandler. I sensed it was you.
Okay! Okay! Ooh-hey-hey-hey! Okay! Okay! Okay! I'll-I'll tell her tonight I can't see her anymore.
I don't know, I don't think mom and dad would mind. Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, how dad used to say, 'God I hope they get together.'
Really? I've been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don't, don't you think we can work on this?
Yeah, pants, what, what an idea. Or better yet, um, how 'bout you go without any pants. Look, I don't know what you're trying to do to me, but just get your butt in there and pick out any shoes that fit your feet, okay. No, no I don't care if they match. I don't care if they make your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat. Okay.
Hey, how can it not be me?!HeyHey!
What are you doing?
Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this.
Emily?!
Rach, Rach, I am so sorry. I am so-so sorry.
No, just give me another minute.
That's all right, Rach, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my sister Monica. This is Chandler. Phoebe. Joey, what up?
Dad, dad, please. Look I don't want anything to upset Emily tonight. Alright, she's had a hard enough couple of days as it is. Now here, here, let me go talk to him, okay?
How weird is that? Y'know? You're moving in with me and have the one thing I don't have. It's like uh, in a way you-you complete me kitchen.
The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.
You're the twinkie?
Oh! Ah. Aw!
Phoebe, 800 is toll free, 801 is-is Utah.
Yeah.
Hi. Sorry we're late but we werewell, there was touching.
I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.
I'm starving!
Naked friends.
You know the song! Sing along!
What's up?
What?
Petty...
What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon, he's not that bad.
Joey?! Joey!!
Here's your girlfriend's button.
Look, Pheebs-Pheebs, it's gonna be okay.
Also an island.
I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you. Bye.
Me either...
Until now.
I thought that was just a rumour.
Are you jealous?
Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie...
No! No! Of course it didn't mean anything! I mean, uh well, I can understand why Emily would think it meant something, y'know, because-because it was you...
Well, I guess we could tape Entertainment Tonight.
Hey, thanks Rach.
OK, I need to lie down.
Getting it away from me would be job one.
The one that always stares at me when I come in?
Yeah, and-and thank you for Emily.
What?!
No, come on don't start. Ouch!
No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!
On account of my rage.
Joey, we just saw it!
No touch! No touch!
Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?
Oh good, you scared me for a minute.
Oh I'm, I'm making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do.
Still?!
Could you be less enthused?
Bec-Did you not hear me?! She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department, okay? They're wild! Why do you want to come anyway?
So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones.
I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!
And, I don't know, if it starts to rain...
No, no, no. Technically the... sex is not... being had, but that's... see, that's not the point. See, um, the point is that... Rachel and I should be, er, together. You know, and if you get in the.... um...
Yeah.
Uh, actually, we're getting a cat.
Why?! Why on the lips?!
Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done.
Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!
Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?
Here they come, here they come. Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight, I'm gonna kill myself, I swear. I can't, I can't watch this. Come on, date over! Date over! Uh-oh, here we go, she's going in.
No, why?
I'd bet I'd still be doing my kara-tay. Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y'know, not doing anything else physical.
Turns out them Emily is just crazy about Susan. Yeah, they're going to the theatre together! They're going to dinner! They're going horseback riding!
Eh-wh-Excuse me?
Oh, hey Aunt Millie.
Hey.
Come on, you know they love you.
Oh.
Carol's pregnant.
We?! We angered it?!
Umm, he said he thought I was funny. So... Okay, look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all about it.
Okay. Sometimes I feel...
Rach, I got a message from you. Who's Michael?
Oh, but-but it is, uh, it's just like the first Thanksgiving, when the Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner.
Is everything okay?
Uhh, naa, no no no, I, I must be thinking of someone else, uh, maybe me. Don't you have some folding to do? Go fold dear. Fold. You fold.
Maybe it's uh Sergeant Sagittarius coming back to flirt some more!
Yeah, which, which we have to leave for in exactly twelve minutes. All right, come on, I'll just pick something out for you.
An egg?
Well you need 60% to pass...
What?!
Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-
Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?
All right, gentlemen, you're up first.
I would say that.
Are you sure? Hold on. I'm sorry you guys, that was a coffee and a....
What?
OK, fine, well I'm not gonna watch, alright.
It's the-Chandler!!
Dad?
No! No! Not-I don't mean I-I see her as a twelve-year-old girl! I mean I-I have a son, who's umm six and I still think of him as a baby.
No, I can't. I would, I really would, but my son is here; I can't leave him. Isn't-you don't think there's any way?
Look, you can't do this Mon. All right, if you do this, I'm, I'm gonna, I'm, I'm gonna.....
Hey!
He didn't get the goggles!
Hey!
Well, you need something to make this day special? Hello! You-you-you have the most special thing of all! You are marrying the woman you love.
Hmm, a lot of this stuff is from Colonial times. Hey, what are some other time periods Rachel?
Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?
You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know?
Uhh, believe me when he's older, he'll understand.
Sure, sweepin'. You never know.
Uhh, those are tacos.
Come on, it's fun!
Oh really. Is that how you felt when you turned thirty?
You? You! Want to watch Ben? Yes! That'd be great, no, I just wanted to ask Monica, because I know how empty her life is.
No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.
Monica, let's go. Come on now people, woman in labor.
Where is she?
Emily's cousin kicked me out!
Rach, you can't look fat in an x-ray.
Not-not really. Th-th-there was just Carol.
That's... that's classic.
Was I talking to her about gas?
Here's my retainer!
Am I?!
I, Ross...
Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!
Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck.
My apothecary table!!!
Um-hmm! Doesn't that sound delicious at the last minute?
What?
You bought Shawn Cassidy!
Happy New Year, Pheebs!
Hey-hey, what are those?
I can't believe this is happening.
Okay umm, why don't we all take a seat, y'know? And uh, and I'll get us all some uh some coffees--Yeah, why don't you. Uh and you guys can talk about whatever, whatever you want. Y'know? Whatever pops into your head.
Is everything ok?
That'd be good...
Yes. I find it to be something of a conversation piece.
Hey, we can rescedule for Saturday.
Okay, Andr should be there in like 45 minutes. All rightie, bye bye. Just easier that way.
You gotta hear this story.
I always knew I was havin a baby, I just never realised the baby was having me.
Oh.
Nice shades.
Cheers!
I am so sorry.
Yeah.
Gas? Wow! Intense.
Well, eww. What? Is it a pimple?
Whip it out, whip it out.
Yeah, he-he's right, he's right. This is your time y'know, yeah, you're young, you're-you're weird, chicks dig that.
Oh, Judy. Oh, Judy.
Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier, y'know-y'know for fun, and I typed mine in and guess what came up? My doctoral dissertation! It's here! Yeah, it's right-it's right down here! In the biggest library in the university!
God no!
No. No. No, I'm-I'm glad you did. Look, if nothing else, it's-it's always great when someone tells you they love you.
Yeah alright.
Come on! All the cool kids are eating 'em!
That said it was my sandwich?!
No, you started it.
I guess so.
And uh, Rachel.
That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now? You and I, we're interfacing.
What?
Yeah, the phone was facing the other way. And that goes back up there.
Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
All right. I'll uh, I'll see you later, okay?
Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn't actually land on the moon. But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely.
But now! I'm there! I'm totally there! I'm-I'm finally where you are!
I just wanna read something. It's your pro list.
Well, Monica keeps changin' the channel.
Nope.
Oh Pheebs, that's great. It doesn't count.
I do.
Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh this is it. Oh my god it's baby time. Baby time.
Good.
Hey, when the snippy guy sees the routine, he'll wanna build us our own platform!
You wanna wander in the hall? Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?
Well, oh, I'm sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I'm a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?
It was my first time.
Are you sure? Because I can stay out as late as you want. I told you how I'm on sabbatical from work, right?
No, you guys, I mean my keyboards are all the way up in-No, yeah, okay.
Y'know-thanks!
No. No.
...now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic Mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic Amphibian in its jaws! How did it get there?!
You guys.
Oh look, did, did you just see that? Did you see? He just waved, he just waved, he's never waved before, you've never waved before. Yes he has. Very good.
A lot of other gas smells...
I'll take sports.
No no, that's me.
Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?
It was a dry day.
Okay! Umm, I uh, I'm your teacher. I'm sorry, you're-you're a student and I-and I like women. In spite of what may be written on the backs of some of these chairs.
Uh, Pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering.
Oohh, 23. Which is what we play to at this casino! You win 10 dollars!
All right, I'll see you guys later.
You tell them to wait!
Well, how about this year, instead of Santa, we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?
Really?! Hey, y'know what? Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, here's-here's 60 bucks, why don't you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.
That's okay.
Wow.
Yes but too me he's just, man.
It was...This disagreement over... My god. You...you look beautiful.
What-what is it?!
Yeah, but this can't be it, I mean.
Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.
Oh Mon, I laughed so hard...
Huh?
That was good.
Believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long.
We're just gonna be friends.
Rach!
Go over there and tell that woman the truth.
I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.
Then you are neither of your parents!
...and it was Ernst Muhlbrat who first hypothesized that the Velociraptor would expand it's collar and emit a high pitched noise to frighten it's predator. Yes Mr. Lewis?
After one class? I don't think so.
Maybe it was both of us, but we had our best friend's interest... But we had our best friend's interest at heart.
What did you want to show us? Because all I can see is this bitchin' van!
All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and dammit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes .
Is-isn't it the best?
Come on! That's great.
Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?
Yeah, they don't like you.
A date.
After what I did? Can you blame her?
Well, I'm gonna go get ready, for my date tonight, so ah, I'll just_ head.
Hey, it'll grow back, right? And she-she's really fun, and she's cool, and-and I'm finally moving on. Y'know? I mean getting over Rachel was so , y'know? Y'know, and I'm finally feeling sane again. And now if I go up there, and-and I kiss her, and, Gooood I wanna kiss her, and-and-and it doesn't work out, right? Do I really wanna put myself through that again?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Y'know, okay. You're right. It is huge. So why don't we take it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm, forget getting married for a sec; just forget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower?
What'd you say?
Yeah. You know what? I know what you mean; I do that too.
No. No. You-you can't help. I mean, I kinda have to do this without your help.
What?
Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I don't want to make it savory.
So they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes.
What the hell are doing?!!
DANGER!!! DANGER!!!!!
I don't know, aheh, your's was the first name that-that popped into my head, I'm I'm sorry. I-I didn't think it would matter.
I can't ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?
Oke-dokey.
You did it, man.
No anchovies.
You are? Me, too!
This is a girl that I really like and had too swoop in there!
Yeah!
Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee.
Look, I do not re-love her.
You don't believe in evolution?
Oh my God. Congratulations.
My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.
I don't know, but when I spoke to her, she said she had already passed the mucus plug.
I hope Ben has a little sister.
Honey. Honey, have you seen my Harmon Kilerbrew bat? Bob doesn't believe I have one.
Ugh, can you believe that guy!
Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me?
Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L.A. so I figured I'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel.
Yeah?
Hey, is Chandler here?
Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.
Hi.
Okay, it's coffee.
Dude! How-how did you write this?
The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?
Hopefully.
Y'know what I didn't wear this suit for a year because you hated it. Well, guess what? You're not my girlfriend anymore so...
What?! Hello! We didn't get married.
I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.
How can you not believe in evolution?
Y'know, the kind of fun, you and Susan had when we were married.
Mon, Mon, are you OK?
Hey listen man, about the stripper...
Okay, sure.
Okay, okay take a guess.
Yeah, I'll get right on that.
Hey-hey, or I could bring my keyboard over here sometime!
What?
Yeah, kinda. It's this woman from work. I hope that won't be too weird. Will it, Rach?
Hey, this- Heyy...
Um, just some presents.
You had fantasies about Emily?
Yeah. What-what should I do?
Oh my God. But the zoo told me that my monkey was dead.
Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.
And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani.
Yeah, Sarah, anything.
No. No-no. No. What would you do next?
Probably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated.
No-no, he's, he's very docile.
Aw, y'know...Y'know, maybe we're-we're just approaching this all wrong. If you're Chandler and-and you wanna hide, where is the last place on Earth people would think you'd go?
The uh, your hair, before, your hair, you said you thought your looks like an 8-year-old's, and I'm just saying I like it. The hair.
Uh-uh-Wow! Uh, I thought you guys were just like making jokes, I had no idea. What you know what? You guys are wrong. Uh yes, there is a chronological age difference but I never notice it. You know why? Because she is very mature. Besides, it doesn't really matter to me what you guys think. I mean, I'm the one dating Elizabeth, not you!
What happened?
What?
The photo album! There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. We just go through it and match everything to the pictures.
Surely you can think of something good.
Thanks a lot.
Wait-wait. I, I got it. I was there.
Hi.
Look, I don't think so Pheebs. All right, I'll do it. But just because you're a friend.
So, for the whole weekend?
It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? Yes it will. Or we can leave it on for now, that's fine.
So then if-if-I mean if you think about it, this is all your fault.
Freakish.
You're right!
That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but I-I really don't wanna see or talk to her.
All right I guess I'm, gonna go pack.
It's just I miss her so much.
How's the maniac?
Monica and Chandler are living together!
Yeah. Maybe today is just, close call day.
I'm so glad you're going on this trip!
Are you sure?
Hey!
Well, hello, Mrs. Ross!
Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay?
Here it comes.
Oh umm, there's also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina. What is that?
Thanks for letting me tag along tonight you guys.
Phoebe, why is your bag moving?
Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didn't bring you here so you can ambush her.
Hey-yeah. Hey Gunther, can I have a scone please? Wanna hear some good news? Someone I know is getting married! Yeah! And weddings are happy occasions! Oh, by-the-by it's my ex-wife Emily!
Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and I can find my way out of there like that!
I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?
Oh. And how was the date?
Hey! Okay! I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite kit!
Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey.
Argue with that.
Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! And thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way.
You've had feelings for me?
Oh, forget it, okay?
It's still looks pretty far!
No, it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay?
2:17.
Hey, divorced men are not bad men!
Oh my God.
No, Rach!
Why?! Are there like bears or something?! Ohh. Oh, protection. Yeah-no, yeah-no, that-that-that I forgot.
Five.
Alright boys, let's eat.
What about the time I said we were on a break?
Ohh, this cake is really good!
I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.
Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.
What should I wear, now I'm all nervous.
Seriously that's a lot of cups.
Carol was wearing boots just like those the night that we- we first- y'know. Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause we-we- Sorry. Sorry.
Who?
150 dollars.
Oh.
Yeah! Oh, I-I love this babies!
There never was a library. I mean there are libraries, its just that I ah, I never worked at one.
Again, very sorry.
I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.
What?!
Uh, uh, well you're, umm, you're my lobster.
G'night.
Emily that's ridiculous. Look, I'm-I'm moving for you, I'm cutting friends out of my life for you. Please, just get on the plane and come to New York. Okay, you'll see you're the only person I want to be with.
Because, because I've got Ben.
That would be no.
Okay! You guys are getting married tomorrow and-and I couldn't be more thrilled for both of you, but as Monica's older brother I-I have to tell you this. If you ever hurt my little sister, if you ever cause her any unhappiness of any kind, I will hunt you down, and kick your ass! What? I'm-I'm-I'm serious! Come-Hey! Dude! Stop it! Okay? I'm-I'm not kidding here!
I know. I feel horrible. Okay.
Hey, I know what'll get us up on a platform!
Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win?
Yeah!
Nobody likes change.
Uh, Eddie something. He just met him.
Hi!
Ooh, I wanna switch to Rachel too!
The judge wouldn't let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you?
What is it?
Y'know, hey! You're the one who ended it, remember?
Is this about Mark?
No!
Why are you mad at me?
Oh! No-n-
Fine! It's your life! I just don't want to see you guys break up! Which you will do if you move in together, but that's what you want, there's nothing I can do. DON'T DO IT!!!!!
I'm an idiot. I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and I'd be out and she'd, she'd see some beautiful woman, and, and she'd be Ross y'know look at her, and I'd think, God, my wife is cool!
Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call.
No, no, don't, don't, rub it! Don't! What gets out hummus?! What gets out hummus?!
No! I balanced my checkbook.
Ah, which, which one?
Catch any big fish?
Really?!
Yeah.
You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.
No, I'm not gonna pick them up.
So, uh, how's she doing?
Correct! What is Chandler Bing's job?
OK, well, um, have a nice evening.
Oh, ah, you don't need that.
Open with a joke? It's a university, not a comedy club!
Y'know what? I can easily get out of this, but there is a chance you can get very, very hurt!
Okay, okay, so we're in the car. Right? And bang! A shot was fired. And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!
All right, ready?
Look, it's just did, did you ever go to a party and think, "Would really anyone miss me if I weren't here?"
Look at that, look at that, see how she's pushing him away and he won't budge. Alright, I'm gonna do something. Excuse me, are you Rachel?
Oh my God, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker.
May I come in?
Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing. Nothing, just, just, I'm fine.
Yes, second in two years. Third overall.
This one?
Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together.
Uh okay, well there's-there's wine in the kitchen.
What am I going to do?
I just wanna say good-bye to you guys and to see if you guys will place a little bet for me, huh? Twenty bucks on black 15.
Hey, you gotta get Mom on the phone. Call Mom! Call Mom!
I'm sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right about her. Y'know, she did try to use sex as a weapon! Yeah, I hurt my back a little.
Yeah, save it for the cab, okay.
...Chandler!
Oh, you've tasted it.
Hi there!
Ohhhhh!
With you?! Yeah right!
Well, fine. Fine! If-if I'm the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word, I'll go up there and defend it myself! And don't you follow me!
Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?
Uh, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to take a moment, just me and him.
Oh, Liam. So uh, what, were you guys playing soccer or something-or should I call it football?
Uh fellas,
Oh, I hope they're not ruined.
Oh...
Good for you.
And thank you, for that.
Well, yeah, kinda. Um, but that's okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people, so I'm allowed to sleep with you. No, no, no, it's flattery.
No, its...Its not that. Umm, now what I'm going to say to you, I'm not saying as your friend. Okay? I'm-I'm saying as it as Monica's older brother.
No, I'm good.
Hi, is uh, is Carol here?
Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole 'Does it?' part just another glance.
Hey.
No, I can't get it out.
Is that Mark?
What? What-what, what are talking about? It-it worked with you.
No. It's the one he's licking.
We're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something. Listen. Don't you hear that?
Not yet.
Whew! That was a brisk ride!
Look, I'm sorry but you-you-you better go Pheebs.
Yowzah!!!
I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!
That audition.
Okay, Jasmine, please, please don't. I love my girlfriend very much, and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?
Look at it this way: you dumped her. Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable... Tell me why you did this again?
She was...
Chandler!!! Chandler!!! Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!
See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music. Y'know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I... I won't play anymore.
S-s-smell her hair? What if I did?
Okay.
Ohhh, hey! All right, listen, I-I have that TV thing in like two hours, and I need your help, okay? What do you think? This blue suit, or this brown one?
The screaming guy?
All right so, Chandler, from now on, don't give your boss a chance to get you. Y'know just ah, don't turn your back to him.
What's the matter?
Hey.
Uh-ha, what about someone who looks like Rachel? I will think about the therapy.
So?
You're joking, right? You guys just walked through the door.
Come on, Pheebs lay off him.
I'm-I'm Ross by the way.
Hey!
Did you see me write one down?
None.
Dude, we are sooo gonna party!
You're alone.
So what do you want me to do?
You've tasted it? You've tasted it.
I'll be right down.
I'm having a boy! I-I'm having a boy!
Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something.
No, I missed and hit the door. But, it opened really hard!
I don't even wanna hear it, you're just...
Woohoo!
Well, these. These are yours right here.
Am I supposed to stand here and listen to this on my birthday?
Oh, you know, I'm just gonna, I'm gonna hang out, work on my music.
Hi!
Pheebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?
And you had no idea they weren't getting along?
Actually that-that's not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No. 72, Dr. Bruce Banner found... Y'know, ugh, nevermind, my girlfriend's a lesbian.
'My scones.'
Thanks.
Some of your old stuff.
Buy mommy.
What?
Yeah!
You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?
I know, I know, it's, it's almost... What do you say we go take a walk, just us, not them?
Yes! We're getting married?!
Excuse me.
Okay, okay, okay. I'll get the bagels.
No, I-I thought it would be more fun this way.
You're right, thanks for keeping me honest dad.
Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket!
That's my sister.
Aw, Mom...
Come on sweetie! You've had to work late every night for the past two weeks, what is it this time?
What, now you're not even taking to me? Look Rachel, I-I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry, I was out of my mind. I thought I'd lost you, I didn't know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insane must I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I don't cheat right, I, that's not me, I'm not Joey!
I told Emily to come. And I just need to y'know, talk to Rachel about it.
Ok, ok, number one: The way you cry at game shows. Number two: how much you love your friends. Number three: the way you play with your hair when you're nervous. Number four: how brave you are for starting your life over. Number five: how great you are with Ben.
I'm getting married today!! Ahh, whoo-hoo!!
Yeah! Yeah, Emily always wanted to get married in this beautiful place that her parents got married, but it's going to be torn down, so... I mean, I-I know it's crazy, but everything up 'til now has been so crazy, and I don't know, this just feels right. Y'know?
A woman in my office is a lesiban. I'm just saying.
Wow, hello! You look great!
What's up?
Well, excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life!
Something about hi.
Anyway. That's when our Mom said we were not to play football ever again.
I just, I don't understand, I mean, how-how can she do this? Y'know, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she'd actually show up?
You mean, we-you and me?
This is crazy! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved her in the past, but now, she is just my wife! Phoebe, will you-will you help me out here?
Wha-what?
Okay, I've got three of my five.
Okay, 'you' can't, or you can't? Okay, that's my finger. That's, that's my knee. Still doing the play. Aaah!
Wait! Wait! Wait! Y'know what? Just stay. Please? It uh... It would really mean a lot to me if you stayed.
Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending this time with me. It's been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say thanks.
Wow! Thanks, you guys. That's uh-ohhh, I wanna, I wanna play you another piece! Umm! Uh-oh! I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. I'll be right back! Okay? This is so nice, I'm-I am so...
That's right, he's not Drake, he's Hans Remore, Drake's evil twin.
Really.
How about we settle this right now! There! Now, no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha!
That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up.
Yeah well, if I know Mark, and I think I do, I'd expect nothing less.
That was the only way I could get him to stop typing!
Oh yeah, why not?
So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
'Scuse us
Apparently she fell in the shower and hit her head.
Newly appointed head lunch chef who is also in charge of purchasing--
All right, bad ankle, got it!
Yeah, I still don't know. I'm sorry I just wanna make sure that I bought the right couch. I need a couch that says, "Kids welcome here." But that also says, "Come here to me!"
Okay! Okay! Okay!
Help!
Okay, but just the jacket. Double-oh and seven are not gettin' in there.
Ahh, oh that's OK, I mean, he's probably got, you know, parties to go to and stuff. But, ya know, he's moved on. Hey, that, that's the way it goes right.
What?
Naa. A while ago I got a sah out of him, which I thought, ya know, might turn into sah-condary caregiver but... Hey, would you uh, would you hold him for a sec, 'cause I, I gotta take this off.
Most of you don't know me, I'm Rachel's boyfriend.
Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?
Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.
Hey, what's this?!
Ohh, I-I see lotion, I have lotion! Will that work?
So! Poetry? Susan's gay! They're being gay together!
Wha-What did he say that was so funny?
Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too.
Hello! What's this? Oh right its that girl's phone number. Yeah-yeah, there it is, just a phone number a really hot girl gave me. It's no big deal, I mean it is her home phone number, but... Whoa! Whoa-whoops, I almost lost this baby! Yeah, the lovely Amanda gives me her number and I-I go and drop it.
Ok, well, if you do take him out for his walk, you might wanna bring his hat, and there's extra milk in the fridge, and there's extra diapers in the bag.
Just, y'know out.
It-it's great to meet you Paul.
Mmm-Unmm.
Hi Whitney.
I know. That's why I did it. Come on, are they really that bad?
Ohh, yeah I already have one.
Yeah.
No, no, I don't wanna put it off, I just, God I just, I spent last year being so unbelievably miserable, ya know, and now, now I'm actually happy. You know, I mean, really happy. I just, I just don't wanna, I don't wanna mess it up, ya know.
Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but there is something you can do.
And that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?
God, do you realize in ten years we're gonna be 40?
Yeah, would you please consider moving here? I mean you were gonna move here anyway, why can't you just do that?
Okay, okay. Enough, enough with the lunging. No! I'm sick of this. Okay. I've had it up to here with you two! Neither you can come to the party!
Yeah.
The test is ready.
Oh, I uh, hope you don't mind, I kinda uh, jazzed it up a little. Check this out. We will, we will, call you back!
So?
MY SANDWICH!!!!!!
Wait-wait, so, you get to be my best man twice and I never get to be yours at all?
Right, um, but, on Hanukkah, Hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle. See, years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees.
She may have died.
Kinda like my uncle Ed, covered in Jell-o.
Wha, OK, now how do you know that?
Hey!
Uh-huh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so, I took it.
Yeah! Yeah! Oh, this will make a great memory.
Thanks for being born.
No! That's-that's my arm!
I'll do it. Hey, whatever you need me to do, I'm your man. Whoa-oh-whoa! Are you, are you okay?
Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let's try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin. Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin... ...does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!
Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?
It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work. And I do, I have to make this marriage work. I have too. But the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here.
You bet. In the U.S., China, Africa, all over.
Oh.
Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.
So, what? That's it?
Oh no, you-you don't understand. Ugh, this is so silly. Umm, this is all because of a sandwich.
Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.
Y'know what? Uh, Rachel is here!
And!! Isabella Rosselini.
It's too cold.
Found it.
Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either. After everything he said, he'd go "ba dum bum chessh"
Oh my God..
Yes, and the dimmer switch.
What are you doing? We're going to a hospital.
OK. OK, this is a picture frame from Ben to my parents, huh.
You are, you're welling up.
Hey, you guys! What do you, what do you think about making that beach trip an annual thing?
No, no, I mean, I mean a thing on my body.
Okay, I'll see you later pal.
Okay, okay, I'll tell 'em it wasn't Chandler who got high. Now who should I say it was?
Phoebe? Phoebe?
No, of course not! ...Yeah, yeah, it is.
So what are you gonna do?
Hey, Pheebs.
Oh my God. Ohh, my little sister and my best friend...shaking up. Oh, that's great. That's great.
No.
I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am. I mean after all we've been through, I just-y'know I wish I had a brother to reciprocate. Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.
What are you doing?
Dysprosium? Try mendelevium.
Marcel, Marcel, give Rossie the remote. Marcel. Marcel, you give Rossie the remote right now... Marce... you give Rossie the remote...
Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you...
Heavy thing, not getting lighter!
And that's, that's funny why?
No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!
And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!
And, I love you!!
You can't do that!
My God! These pants are burning up! Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now! What is she trying to kill me? It's like a volcano in here! Are you hot?
Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!
You can see where he'd have trouble.
You were worried about me? You didn't know how I was going to react?
Look, look, look.
hey, fella! How you doing?
Yeah.
Excuse me ladies. I'm sorry?
Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?
Oh, yumm!
Hey, here's a thought.
No?
Yeah.
Oh my God, the wedding book?! I haven't seen that since the forth grade!
Hey!
Looking up?
Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!
He's right, even if it's to say something complementary.
Wait a minute, look.
Oh.
I can't believe they-they didn't even tell us!
So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don't have to sell those cookies anymore.
Hey uh Mon, I saw the Porsche parked out front, can I get the keys? Thought I'd take that bad boy out for a little spin.
Yeah.
I know, why not?
Where ya goin'?
Julie, can you hold this for a second, thanks.
It's still a gift! I got it from the gift shop!
All right, I'll see you tonight.
But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.
Oh, just planning my bachelor party with my best man.
Okay.
No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.
Look, I know you don't want to hear this right now but, we've seen him in his new place, alright. And he's happy, he's, he's decorated.
No! No! Wh... What are you doing?!! GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That's excellent.
How hot do I look in this, huh?!
What, it's not your fault.
It's over.
Hmm? Oh, a student I don't know.
C'mon, you know everyone I've been with. All, both of them.
What's-what's going on?
This place is really beautiful!
Yeah!
He finally asked you out?
Yeah. Everything but, the little blue one.
Look who I found standing outside of the Szechwan Dragon staring at a parking meter.
You did so. I swear, I swear How long has she been in the bathroom?
I'm sorry. See that's the good thing about my job. All the dinosaurs on my table are already dead.
I know that!
Uh, I like to, uh, to add something to that...
So I'm gonna take off then!
Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesn't really have any close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan something, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think it's gonna make a difference
Oh yeah! You're-hey, you're right! Here's an affordable place, two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it's available in five weeks!
Everybody!
Well isn't there something you can do to earn a little extra money? I mean, can't-can't you pick up, I don't know, an extra shift here?
I'm gonna call after you!
Hey!
That's Daddy?! But doesn't it bother you? You're a waitress.
I know!
I uh, I don't know, I guess I'm just gonna see, see what happens.
Yeah, yeah I mean, you get your money and you learn a little something, what's wrong with that?
Pheebs, what, is it the age thing?
No, that's all right.
Chandler!
Ohh, it's Joey! I love Joey!
You're never gonna believe it uh, Monica and Chandler are moving in again. That's great news right-I mean for them. Right?
I need juice! People need juice!!
Come here.
Uh, hello, the buzzer buzzed. It doesn't count.
Uh, actually mom, I think Monica thanked him for the both of us.
Nice to see you again Dr. Green.
Is that-are you saying yes? Is that yes?
Oh no-no-no!
Oh, you could just go uh, "greatest of ease... BAH-bah-bha-bhannn." Then go right into it.
I can't think of anything.
Right. So is it gonna be like 'I'm abandoning you while your upset.'
Uh.
Oh, is that funny?! Oh, you-you find that funny?! Well maybe Chandler should know some of your secrets too!
Joey-
What-what are you doing?! Are you-Okay that's not funny! Just stop horsing around!
It was ridiculous. Ya know, these guys, they were bullies, actual bullies, ya know. We're grown ups, this kinda stuff isn't supposed to happen anymore.
Wait a minute, does-does everyone feel this way?
Yeah.
Cassie, how you-how you doin' on that...hot dog.
Ooh. What is the name of Chandler's father's Las Vegas all-male burlesque?
What?
It-it-The point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.
Bye.
Look, G. I. Joe's in, Barbi's out. And if you guys can't deal with it, that's your 'too bad.'
Hey!
Whoah, uh, what happened to, uh, 'Forget relationships! I'm done with men!' The whole, uh, penis embargo?
Hey guys!
Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?
I think the check in is that way.
Well, it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woo-hoo. That means, that means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girl's bodies, waking up next to people you don't even know...
Hey!
Pepper?
And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?
Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?
The volcano?
No.
I'm sorry, my pie was, was in your hood. Now I just have to get the coffee out of that guy's pants and I'll be back in the hospital by 7.
My wife's a lesbian.
My marriage is over.
Oh.
Rach, have you never done this before?
That's correct. Ladies?
Yeah. Yeah, actually um, I wanted to talk to you about that whole annulment thing?
Hey!
So, I just finished this fascinating book. By the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and-and-and live forever as a machine.
Look, I-I drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it. Okay Rach, that's you. That's the couch.
Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts.
Rachel!! Monica!!
It's a little early to be drinkin'.
First of all, I'm not losing...
Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not laughing now, are ya pal!
Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y...
Yeah, no one talks like that!
Yeah-oh! Hey listen umm, Emily found this wedding dress in London...
Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?
Y'know, he hums when he pees!
I know!
Okay, I'll see you soon buddy. Be back in an hour.
Hey-Ooh! What's-what's that, dinner stuff? You making dinner?
Look, don't blame us. You guys coulda been there, you know.
What?
Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uh... It's batch 16! 16 people! Get out of the way!
Alright. The, uh, the neighbours must be vacuuming. Well, so long as we're here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um...
Hi!
Got me.
Oh right. Right. Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and tickled you 'til you cried? We're probably too old to do that now.
Oh, here, I, I'll get it for ya. Whad'ya want?
Did you see me? I was pretty good, huh? That is one fun game!
And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did, and peed all over the crossword.
Nooo, but it, but it's great.
Hey, you wet my pants!
And while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she wants...
Right.
How rude.
Not just restaurants, from our house.
Look, I was nervous! You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring! I got up there and they were all like staring at me. I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out.
Yeah.
We met at Phoebe's birthday party, I'm, I'm Ross Geller.
No Phoebe, don't look! You don't want to see what's under there!!
Yeah. Op! Uh-oh! I think your Dad must've added wrong. He only tipped like four percent.
Sorry.
Thanks again, Dr. Green.
Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now.
Everyone, this is Julie.
Well, you better hop outta the shower, cause... I gotta flush.
I know-
Oh, please...
Who's that?
I've never walked down the aisle knowing it can't end in divorce.
...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.
No, no, let me finish.
Yeah! Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, y'know? Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.
So what, we just sit?
Hi!
Oh, I know. Y'know what, I never would've gotten this if it weren't for you. No really, when I'm with you I'm-I'm like this whole other guy, I love that guy! I mean, I love you too, a lot, but that guy! I-I love that guy!
Thank you.
She's dating. She's dating.
Neil Sedaka wears them.
Nooo!! Gandolf?! Gandolf is coming to town?
Alright. : Your money's mine, Green.
We'd like to close our accounts.
Yeah, yeah, she's here.
No. Now maybe.
Yeah. I'm paying you to stop.
A basket of mini-muffins.
She doesn't know she was fired yet, does she?
Chandler's gone again!
Mmm hmmm.
Ahh, I-I did leave the gel on a little longer then it said to.
Rach!
Yes, it was horrible. She cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me. Anyway, I did the right thing.
But-but, Liam's on my team.
Hm-mmm.
Hey, you're right.
Oh-ho, whoa! Sorry, Tommy. I almost spilled this hot coffee on you.
Em-Emily? Em-Emily? Emily!
We're good.
Okay! All clear!
That's romantic.
She does want to.
Who is Maria?
No way.
Hey, y'know what? This is your fault! You're the one that didn't move his-his appointment.
Mon.
All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.
Hey, Joey. Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?
Okay! You take care!
Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way.
Really?
So what's a matter, you need a dentist? I've got a good one.
You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.
I'm reading your ad.
Ah, what good are you.
The gas is odorless, but they add the smell so you know when there's a leak.
I got it!
Wait uh, listen. I-I, I have to tell you something. Umm, I've been thinking, I'm just gonna come out and say it. Okay? I-I-I ah, I-I think I love you.
Why?! How?! How is he a genius?
Of Ross and Rachel.
Y'know what? I-I'm not even gonna talk about this. Okay? This little thing is over. I know you have a girlfriend! Okay--Yeah! And I know about the other professors! How do you think that makes me feel Ned?! You used me! You don't love me and you never did! Ah Professor Winston, Professor Fredrickson, I'll be right with you. Don't make this worse and I'll give you a C. Shall we?
What?!
Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.
In the bank.
Marc- oh, this is ridiculous! We've been all over the neighbourhood. He's gone, he's-he's just gone.
Hey Rach, can you pass me the TV Guide?
Well, it was loong. I didn't even realise how late it was, until I noticed the 5 o'clock shadow on her head. Anyway, she didn't want to stay. I called a cab; she just left.
I'm just trying to help you, move on.
You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?
I don't think you have much choice.
No, no, that won't be ah, that won't be necessary
So umm, where are the other guys?
Yep, and you know what other holiday is coming up?
You need to get some sleep.
Hi.
Now, how will they know if you're ready?
Very bad.
Hey, you're right.
Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be... flung by now?
Hi!
Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I left.
Ah, yeah, yeah. Umm, we started talking after she y'know, did her thing. And it turns out she's got a boy about Ben's age, so we're taking them to a gym-boree class. Why, is that okay?
I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay?
Oooohhh, I'll bet she's one of those people.
Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here...
Hi.
Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica. Oh, I guess he doesn't feel like talking right now. He's smiling though! Okay, talk to you later.
But it absolutely didn't. It didn't!! It didn't!!
All right, let's not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was some sexual chemistry between them.
