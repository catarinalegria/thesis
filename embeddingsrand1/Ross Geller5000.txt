Yeah?
No! No! Look-Hey, enough is enough! Look, I am sorry that you feel guilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom, but this is not your old mom. This is a cat! Okay, Julio the cat! Not mom! Cat!
Wha, OK, now how do you know that?
What? No! No, I'm not stopping. I'm Red Ross!
Hey, you wet my pants!
Nothing, it's just that hypnosis is beyond crap.
No-no it's not. What-what happened there Ned?
Well let there-what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says, "You ride this bike or I'll sh...I'll shoot you."
Great! Because people kept showing up, I think it's like uh-a thing!
Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily, honey, okay?
Well, yeah, kinda. Um, but that's okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people, so I'm allowed to sleep with you. No, no, no, it's flattery.
What's with her?
Hi!
Ah, no Mon, Dad had to buy everyone of your boxes because you ate them all. But ah, y'know I'm sure that's not gonna happen this time, why don't I put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the Rudolph's.
Noo! No, not cuddlily, not me, just her. I'm like you, I need the room. Okay, come here. Okay, you're in bed...
Still?!
Hey roomies!
All right, did you just say all right?
1987, the day after Christmas, at Sean McMahon's party. I played you one of my songs, y'know Interplanetary Courtship Ritual.
Y'know, you're right. Thank you.
Y'know what? I can easily get out of this, but there is a chance you can get very, very hurt!
It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! It's, it's apples and oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go.
Oh my God!
Noooo.
What?! Give-give me a brush.
Come here. Listen, you deserve so much better than him...you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you.
Well, why don't you just start with something simple. Like umm, Monica from the moment I met you, I knew I loved you.
Yeah! They're putting together this panel to talk about these fossils they just found in Peru and The Discovery Channel's gonna film it!
Hmmm. Oh, no, no, I just thinking about something funny I heard today. Umm, Mark, Mark saying 'I'll see you Saturday.'
What kind of research?
Hey-hey, since you're the 'fix-it' lady, here's a pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesn't want to have the wedding at all?
Well, uh, for your information, there's a woman at the museum, who's curator of moths and other... uh... winged things... who's, uh, let it be known that she is drawn to me much like a... well, you know. But so far I've been keeping her at bay, but, uh, if this is the deal...
Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?
Actually, it wasn't that close.
Excuse me?
Emily?!
Yeah, that'd be cool!
That's my sister.
Well, oh, I'm sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I'm a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?
Apparently she fell in the shower and hit her head.
No you do-y'know what, you're not gonna suck me into this.
Yeah, cheerie-o!
No, no, that-that, that's all right. Umm, I'm just glad you called.
Hello.
Dude, that reverse lay-up! Oh...
Hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat?
Okay!
Oh, sure! I'm sure.
Yeah.
Oh, I'm just over here with Ben. I thought we'd say hi.
I hate America! When I finish this game, I swear I am moving.
Really?
That guy, he burns me up.
Okay, guys.
What?
Bye!
Yeah.
Happy too.
Yeah, it's hard okay, I only have two spots left.
Right.
Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you both, here?
Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uh... It's batch 16! 16 people! Get out of the way!
Hi.
Y'know what? I-I'm not even gonna talk about this. Okay? This little thing is over. I know you have a girlfriend! Okay--Yeah! And I know about the other professors! How do you think that makes me feel Ned?! You used me! You don't love me and you never did! Ah Professor Winston, Professor Fredrickson, I'll be right with you. Don't make this worse and I'll give you a C. Shall we?
Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh...
Oh, right!
All right, gentlemen, you're up first.
Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk...
Okay! Ho-ho! We did not steal your thunder because we are not getting back together!
He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...
Then you should have said something before I met her.
That was so cool man, the way you leaned on that guy.
I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you. Bye.
It's not a club.
Hey.
Alright, that's it. I've had enough of this, alright. Gunther, these guys are trying to take our seat.
Yeah, we went shopping!
You're not a lefty?
The photo album! There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. We just go through it and match everything to the pictures.
She seems really, really fun!
Yeah.
Isabella Rosselini.
How, how, um how can you not be going?
Yeah, she's got to go back to London. But you know what? I've been prepared for this from the start. We both knew we had two weeks together, and that's it. Y'know.
You know what, you guys, we don't have to watch this.
Hey, what's this?!
Do you uh, do you talk about me?
Me? No.
I'm still hungry!
Yeah, it's-it's tough being single. That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda.
You want me to take some girl I've never met to the opera so you can go to a club and flirt with some guy, hmm, that-that is a toughie.
And on your anniversary, for shame!
Yeah, of course, Donald.
Well, but aren't you pissed at him?! I mean this guy abandoned you! I gotta tell you if this were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger! I mean I-I-I'd walk in there and I'd be like, "Yo, dad! You and me outside right now!" I kinda scared myself.
All right, bad ankle, got it!
Hi.
Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married! You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! All right, it's about compromise! Do you always like it? No! Do you do it? Yes! Because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time! It's real life, okay? It's what grown-ups do!
Joey where's the pipe that was holding the door open?
Okay.
Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don't you think you could at least hear the guy out?
Yep.
That's all you're basing this on?
Right. Ohh! You-you want me to be your backup.
I know.
None.
Tho?
Wait a minute, is this, is this for real?
Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.
Well, howdya feel?
Look I told you...
Hi.
You did so. I swear, I swear How long has she been in the bathroom?
What?! Over a stupid room!
That uh, that was pretty funny. Wasn't it?
That's okay Rach, we're not liking Ross right now.
Bye Marcel. See ya on the big screen. You keep people drinkin' that beer, OK. I miss you buddy.
I- I- I ca- I can't believe this. I mean, all I asked you to do was keep him in the apartment.
Yes! My baby's finally free!
Well, well I am married. Even though I haven't spoken to my wife since the wedding.
Uh, I like to, uh, to add something to that...
Do you want me too?
Lady, he is people. He has a name, okay? He watches Jeopardy! He he touches himself when nobody's watching. Please, please have a heart!
I have no idea. I mean... But-but I assure you I will figure it out.
Don't be scared, I-I know it sounds crazy and-and people will say it's too soon, but just-just think, think how great it will be.
Fine. I just need to know that you're not gonna tell your sister.
Okay, good stuff. Umm, well she's-she's sweet and pretty and...
Easy.
Hello!
Im gonna be a father.
She doesn't know which one of us she wants, me or this Colin guy.
Oh yeah, how about you and the, "I'm sorry!"
Sure. Once, at work I-I thought carbon dating was fossilized...
All right.
What trail?
Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.
He won't? He won't! Because, isn't that, isn't that the, the short story you were writing?
No, no, I mean, ya know, I, I read a book and there was a girl named Emily and I thought, I thought that might be good.
Yeah, but you're making me look bad!
Huh?
Is-isn't it the best?
Well, not playing raquetball!
On behalf of everyone, I'd just like to say behuh.
I'm sorry the answer there would be...none of us.
Hi, we're visitiing. It's Ben and his da-da. Da-da. Can you say da-da? Look, I'm gonna tell your momies you said it anyway so you might as well try.
Look, I don't feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?
Which one is Gina?
Hey! Okay! I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite kit!
Powder! Yeah! Yeah, I have powder!
You're sure? Nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything?
I thought that was just a rumour.
Hey, Phoebs, how'd it go.
Hi, Pheebs!
I don't know, I don't get, I don't get it, I mean, wh, wh, two months ago Rachel and I were like, this close. Right now, what, I'm takin messages from guys she, she meets at the movies? I mean this, this Casey should be takin' down my messages, ya know, or, or, Rachel and I should be together and, and we should get some kind of me, message service.
Well, I asked him if he wanted to eat, he said, "No." I asked him if he wanted to sleep, he said, "No." I asked him what he wanted to do, he said, "No." So, he's sweeping.
Hey!
What?! How's that?
Look, okay-okay I had food poisoning! It's not like I choose to do it! It's not like-It's not like I said, "Umm, what would make this ride more fun?!"
We'll give you Janice.
It's worth the pain. Y'know what, you know what? It's not.
....I have to go to China.
Oh, well...
What are you saying?
Thanks.
Hello, Susan. Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...?
Monica. Whaddya think?
I can't ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?
Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?
Oh, thank God!
Totally.
I mean, why not! I mean, I mean why not?!
Tell me about it. So what, what's your magic number?
Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you should start think about getting a different job.
Umm...
And for the record, it took two people to break up this relationship!!
Oh my God.
It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.
Newly appointed head lunch chef who is also in charge of purchasing--
Okay Ben, Santa has to go. Say good-bye!
Well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble.
Oh, well, I, I guess it musta been the day after you were born. We were in the hospital room, your mother was asleep, and they brought you in and gave you to me. You were this ugly little red thing, and all of a sudden you grabbed my finger with your whole fist. And you squeezed it, so tight. And that's when I knew.
Well that's fine with me. Could use the money.
Hmm? Oh, a student I don't know.
Joey, I did not break this! Okay? That has been broken for a while.
I always knew I was havin a baby, I just never realised the baby was having me.
Ohh... OK.
Oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'Read 'em and weep.'
Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking. Maybe you didn't erase it.
Okay, okay take a guess.
Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this.
I've seen her at work, but I always figured, ah-huh? But, uh, I made her dinner. We had a great time. And we're going out again tomorrow.
Yeah?
Huh? Oh, I got this--this!
I don't know what you're talking about.
All right, fine! Fine! Have me fired! But uh, I want you to know that you and I are not all that different. I mean, I too am a neat guy.
Hey.
Hey!
What?! Chandler she's our cousin!
Hey, how can it not be me?!HeyHey!
Well, everyone's gotta kiss someone. You can't kiss Ross you got the history.
And shame on you! You should know better, Joey needs to work. Now come on!
Geez! Are you ready?
What?
Monica, if you want, I can lend you some money.
No... No... No. I think I should stay, I think we should both know whats going on.
Rach, you can't look fat in an x-ray.
Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!
That's 'cause-'cause you're mom's dog kept-kept looking at me.
No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!
Well hey, who did these resumes for ya?
Yeah.
No see now, now I can't because uh, I'm feeling too self conscious.
Why-why can't you take a couple of days off?
My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over.
Oh I-, Oh wait, Tony can you hang on? That's the other line. Hello. Oh yeah she's here but uh, can she call you back? OK thanks. Call Joanna. Hi.
Okay, that's it, I can't take it anymore.
You, you sure you need shoes? Okay.
Hey!
And what did he ask you not to call him?
Hey!
Ben, you ready? All right, gimme your foot. Ok, on three, Ben. One, two, three. Ok, That's it, Ben.
Maybe I should open a divorced men's club.
Oh, but-but it is, uh, it's just like the first Thanksgiving, when the Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner.
Well, yeah!
We have got to start locking that door!
Yeah. I guess I can cut him some slack.
Good morning.
I don't know. It's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I, I definitely don't care about my sandwich.
No, she kept kicking me away!
Pheebs...
Alright you know, why don't I just meet you upstairs.
Uh no-no, she-she's out for the night.
Oh. And what do you call that?
Oh-oh, guess what? I-I have a date with Elizabeth Hornswoggle.
So then if-if-I mean if you think about it, this is all your fault.
Hey
Hmm.
What?
You've tasted it? You've tasted it.
You got a job?
That's not true!
Look, I... Look, I'm having a great time with you and I just don't want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us. So, I'm sorry I just don't think we should go away together yet. It's-it's too soon.
No no, that's me.
Yes, second in two years. Third overall.
Oh! Yeah.
Mmm.
Hm-mmm.
Oh-no. No. No.
Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.
Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.
Seven.
Total wuss!
Hey. Happy Thanksgiving!
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you don't, uh, you don't believe in evolution?
Because you sent away the dog!
Lift!! And slide!
Who's drink can I freshen?
So that's two of my wives.
No no, you're fine, you're fine.
I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry. I wa-I was disgusted with myself, and this morning I was so, I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy, and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible.
It came in the mail today, it's uh, 72 long-stemmed red roses, one for each day that I've known and loved Emily, cut up into mulch!
Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands...
Yes, yes I am. And you are a....
Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes.
Okay sorry, whew.
Hey! I just got uh, my teacher evaluations! Check out what this one student wrote, "I loved Dr. Geller's class. Mind blowing lectures! Dr. Geller, you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department!"
You're livin' the dream.
Animal sex, animal sex? So what're you saying, I mean, you're saying that like, there's nothing between us animal at all. I mean there's not even like, uhm, a little animal, not even, not even like, like chipmunk sex?
Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?
No, no, I mean, I mean a thing on my body.
She's not Rachel.
Uh actually Joey, it's the Cretasous period.
Okay, it's not, it's not.
Oh, yeah, no problems. It's all taken care of.
I, uh, well... I... I met Russ.
Come on, you made coffee! You can do anything!
Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but there is something you can do.
That was good.
What? A brain transplant?!
Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don't I have to wait a while?
Listen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I... we're kind of a thing.
Right. I guess, I guess I should call Emily.
Well I-I-I, that kind of thing requires some serious thought. First, I'll divide my perspective canidates into catergories....
Oh yeah-No-You're welcome. We'll talk about it later.
Hey!
You're fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver.
Hhhiiii.
Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?
Hey, I've been doin' it since the ninth grade, I've gotten pretty damn good at it.
And what--What are you typing that for? Did you hear what she said? We don't get the annulment. Don't type that! What?! Stop typing! Hey! Stop typing! Stop typing! Stop typing!!
Oh hey, hey, huh, how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon okay, and maybe a tournament on my new dart board? Huh, huh, what do you think? Two days of darts, it'll be great!
Joey, Homo Sapiens are people.
I know.
OK, you guys, ya know, I think we've seen enough, let's turn it off.
Come here, here, come here, come here, Mrs. Buffay. Sorry, about what I said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you were just a cat. When clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friend's mother.
I'm going to the bathroom.
What? That's great. That is great. What did we just finish talking about Ben?!
Well, how about this year, instead of Santa, we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?
Nope.
Seriously that's a lot of cups.
Yeah-yeah I uh, I have a uh, a guy problem.
MY SANDWICH!!!!!!
Pepper?
So what do you want me to do?
Are we really in Montreal?!
Hey, you're right.
Thanks guys! I really appreciate this, y'know, but you don't have to rub my butt.
What? Let me see.
It's not something you are! It's something you have!
The judge wouldn't let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you?
Wait a minute, are you doing that thing where you pretend it didn't go well but it really did go well?
I've said it! Okay?! But it's over Joey!
Ohh, Geller's got one hooked! Ohh! Looks like a big one! Yeah, ohh! Ohh! It's the classic struggle between man and- Someone knocked over a lamp.
Happy to.
Okay, 'you' can't, or you can't? Okay, that's my finger. That's, that's my knee. Still doing the play. Aaah!
Hi? Sorry, we got disconnected...
Ah, the heart of every healthy relationship. Honesty, respect, and sex with celebrities.
What? So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler?
Well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back.
And why wouldn't he get it?
Anyway.. um.. So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow?
No touch! No touch!
Five.
Okay. This stuff?
Oh, well of course, the humiliating. So, so wee, we're okay.
The ride broke down. So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom.
"...subcategories. The first of these subcategories is..."
Ohh, I just like the smell. Mmmm.
Oh, thanks!
Oh.
Hi.
Well, she'll call back, don't be such a baby.
Yeah and he didn't really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed he meant you.
Hey, where's Chandler?
So, um, what do you do for a living?
Hey!
I didn't order lemonade.
No-no, it's not that, it's just... I-I just moved in.
Okay umm, bad stuff. Well, I'm-I'm 12 years older than she is.
What?! The guys against the girls? See, that's ridiculous Monica, because I'm only down by three touchdowns.
Why not?
Uh-huh.
Okay!
What is it?
I didn't get a cat.
Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her.
You're alone.
I'm sorry, it's just one of my last nights together before she leaves for camp-to be a counselor!
Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me. I'm sorry.
Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! And thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way.
Rachel. Hey.
I missed you too.
So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?
Yeah, losers talk!
Oo-oo!
I know when I'm 90 she'll be like 80 and it won't seem like such a big difference.
Pheebs!
Oh yeah! Batch 17 was good. I did not like batch 16. I'm okay.
Nice to see you again Dr. Green.
Calm down. There's no reason to get testy.
So Joey, you okay?
Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either. After everything he said, he'd go "ba dum bum chessh"
I dont know whether hes testing me, or just acting out, but my monkey is out of control. But, he keeps erasing the messages on my machine, "supposedly" by accident.
Joey, some people don't like that.
Not broad backed!
Uh, Pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering.
Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe.
Wow! I could've died tonight.
Shoot.
What, you didn't get it? The doctor is a monkey.
Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out. I mean for, for all you know I could be a fashion..... monger.
Wha-what?
Bye Janine!
Yeah!
Y'know what? He didn't want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we don't talk to him at all!
Wha? No no! Ah! All gone! So good! Maybe Chandler has some left.
No?
Oh, and also, he's, he's walkin' kind of funny, his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he's in there just sort of y'know...
No. It's the one he's licking.
Yeah, but this can't be it, I mean.
Hey!
I'm pretty sure that it is...
C'mon Rachel.
Okay.
Great, great, and I miss that too, I miss everything.
What's that on the bottom?
I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard. I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif... at one point there were villagers.
Am I supposed to stand here and listen to this on my birthday?
Open up. We want to talk to you.
No, no, we won't.
Oh I, I don't-I don't think that would be the best idea.
All I'm saying is, it's one thing being prepared for an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack, I don't know, like a surprise!!
Lemme see.
All I have to do is close my eyes. See? Woo-hoo!!
What's the matter?
Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the way they were.
What is that?
All yours.
Didn't you spend last night at Joey's?
I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision? I'm actually asking you!
Oh just say it Kyle!
You take your time.
Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other.
So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean it's a really big step! And-and what's the rush?!
You have a line down your face.
Hi!
...now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic Mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic Amphibian in its jaws! How did it get there?!
Hi.
Oh, oh Chandler...
I wasn't sleeping.
Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask.
Yep. Okay.
Dude, what am I gonna...
Hi! Yeah! Tommy's in line for the bathroom and someone just cut in front of him, I think he's gonna snap.
Okay, Monica. Mon, uh what-what you just saw...
Of course she would, you're a college man.
Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger?
It would really help when I'm kissing you if you didn't shout out my sister's name.
So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?
Are you sure?
We were on a break!
Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title?
No way!
Oh, eh, just thinking about Emily getting married tomorrow.
Yeah, I-I really do. Hey! This-this was a gift?!
But I don't know it. What I do know is that you owe $2300 at Isn't it Chromantic.
Yeah, it is.
I know.
Yeah!
My wife's a lesbian.
OK, well, um, have a nice evening.
Well, I'm going to take off. Congratulations man.
OK, now I'm nervous.
I just, I hate this so much! I mean, every time I go pick her up at the airport, it's-it's so great. But at the same time I'm thinking, "Well, I'm gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off."
Alright.
Thank you.
...now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt.
What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.
You can totally, totally live on this.
Hey, y'know, y'know what would make me really happy?
And now you want that money back.
Well I...I told him that if he ever hurt you I would hunt him down and kick his ass! What?! What?! What is the matter with everybody?! I am serious! I would kick his ass!
Wow!
Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? I'm fine, I'm fine.
But now! I'm there! I'm totally there! I'm-I'm finally where you are!
I don't have too. I can just look at you.
Oh no! An asteroid!
Great. He's doing great. Don't you worry about Chandler.
Y'know what? Uh, Rachel is here!
Well hello! I'm Ross!
Ah. Joey you're-you're having lunch with my mom?
Oh. Listen, have you ever been uh, you know, foolin' around with a girl and uh, she started laughin'?
What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Right.
Y'know what...
Hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. Cause when you have to move back in with Joey, Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me.
Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I die. She made no such promise.
Oh...my...God! I-I see what this is! You are in love with Rachel!
Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust.
Okay when you're playing a machine and it hasn't paid out, a lurker waits for you to give up and then...
Ohhh. Big boy, riding the bus--Hey, I have a question. How come it says Property of Human Services on his butt?
Right.
No. No, uh, Phoebs? You can'tyou can't do...
Well I, I don't know. Why?
What big thing?
Uhh, those are tacos.
It's all right! Everything's gonna be all right.
Ok.
Hi!
Come on, it's fun!
Who needs a lease when it's family!
What you got over there? Tacos?
Hey.
All right, I'll see you tonight.
He could never get a woman like that in a million years.
Oh-ho please. Ask her how?
No.
I'm gonna use the cushion.
Alright, shall we?
Pheebs, Pheebs, the babies are coming now.
Phoebe, I told her you already knew.
Hi.
Well uh, you see that, that little cluster of stars next to the big one? That is Ursa Major.
Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived! Here.
Well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine, he's just sleeping now.
Hi, honey.
Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
Yeah... I guess. I don'tI don't know. Alright, just... just give her this for me, OK?
Hey.
In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week.
Oh my God it's just like I dreamed it!
Hey Joe did... Did you ever have a threesome?
I do not always have to be-okay, okay.
Hey you.
Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy!
What do you mean?
I don't know what I'm going to do. That date starts in like an hour.
Somewhere maybe along the equator?
Because it's a special hat. See he bought it 'cause he was feeling really down one day so he got the hat to cheer himself up, ya know. Now Chandler...
I'm an idiot. I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and I'd be out and she'd, she'd see some beautiful woman, and, and she'd be Ross y'know look at her, and I'd think, God, my wife is cool!
Hello.
Thanks guys! I really appreciate this, y'know, but you don't have to rub my butt.
Susan, go deep.
Yep, and you know what other holiday is coming up?
Yeah. I'm paying you to stop.
A little. Yeah. I made a snack.
Need some help?
Well if you can't remember, can't we just forget about this?
For real?
Yeah, definitely, I'm sure you'll feel totally different when it's our baby.
....................Yeah.
Look, it's just did, did you ever go to a party and think, "Would really anyone miss me if I weren't here?"
I'm gonna go get him! Okay, I am going back in!
Mr. Dickens gets to pick 'em.
Oh, it looks like mom and dad's house. Oh, it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic is...Oh my God!!
Great!
You weren't there! Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to seize! Y'know?
You've sentenced him?!
Oh, just this woman that I met last night at the party.
Why did you do that?
Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me.
So uhh, you ready?
Well, uh, do you have a Santa-outfit left?
Until now.
Umm, did you notice anything wierd about Ben today?
Why are you laughing?
Hey, can I, can I get in on that? Because I'm kinda hungry myself.
No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I'm happy for ya, but I'm tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don't know what to do anymore.
Well that brings me in the loop a little.
Yeah, she's fired.
Hi.
You know what I like most about him, though?
Thank you.
What guys? Oh, yeah.
Yeah, he-he's right, he's right. This is your time y'know, yeah, you're young, you're-you're weird, chicks dig that.
I don't know! Just-just talk to him-entertain him and keep him alive.
I don't know, I don't think mom and dad would mind. Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, how dad used to say, 'God I hope they get together.'
Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater.
Zoo dollars?
Sure, do whatever you want.
Right.
No that's not what I want. Uh, I'm glad you guys were bonding but I...
No, because she hasn't come home yet. And she hasn't been home all night! She's obviously staying with that other guy, and I'm the stupid moron who spent the whole night outside her apartment!
Okay, I gotta go.
Shh! Here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey! Hey, uh, did you just feel that?
There you go! Good enough for your party, huh?
That was the only way I could get him to stop typing!
I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg.
Oh fine.
Well I uh, I skipped forth grade.
You grow up.
Joey, it's Ross! I need some help!
Aw, right.
That's... that's classic.
OK.
Yes I would.
No really, I mean, I mean, God, I could use a friend.
O-okay, Rach calm-calm down, okay? She-she's really upset we're just talking.
That's, that's, that's a big candy bar. I had the most amazing time with you.
Say something clever! Okay, doesn't have to be clever, it just has to be words. Say some words. Any words will do. Oh my God! This is the longest that anyone has not talked ever! There is nothing you can say to make this worse!! So just say something!! I-I, I uh haven't had sex in a very long time. Yeah, you really shouldn't have said anything.
Hey, you guys! What do you, what do you think about making that beach trip an annual thing?
I'm not freaking out, I'm just saying, if somebody had come to me with the idea andndash;
All right, bye!
Ow! Ow! Oh, no-no-no!
Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y...
And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
Wait a minute, one box! Come on, I'm trying to send a little girl to Spacecamp, I'm putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you?
Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben. 'A real American hero. I'm G.I. Joe!' Drop the Barbi, drop the Barbi.
Hey Mon!
Your good friend?
Hey!
No, no it's not interesting. OK, it's very, very not interesting. In fact it's actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting.
That's right!
Oh, thank you, thanks. So uh, how was your night last night?
Well Mr. Big Shot is better than 'wethead'.
Smooth man. Yeah, you got some chilie on your neck. Well, I just want to say, thanks everyone, this-this was great. And hey! See you guys Monday morning. Thanks Joey.
Yes but too me he's just, man.
Wow. I'm sorry, when I was a kid I lost a bike to that.
150 dollars.
Come on!
You're the twinkie?
I'm sorry I'm late, what happened?
Monica? You're Mom.
Oh...
Joey's asking if you've just ruined the first book he's ever loved that didn't star Jack Nicholson?
Uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murder capital of the North-East, I was, uh, kinda wanting to run something by you. Y'know how we were, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff? Well-
I could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back.
What?
Okay. Okay. Okay.
Oh. Thanks. Uh, has anyone seen Rach?
Okay, you go grab it!
Yeah, right.
Yeah.
What? Oh, okay. Wait here.
Oh my god.
Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year.
Looks to me like he's the one getting the job.
Not for the next few minutes.
Rachel! What are you doing here?
Nono, that would be me again.
So honey this uh, this threesome thing umm, I mean how-how are you gonna start to find...
Kiwi? Kiwi? I thought it was a key lime pie.
Hi.
What?
No, that's all right.
Yeah. But, the good news is that Phoebe said that I could stay at her place for a while. So...
Wow!
No, you, ya know there's no need to make it u. . . how?
Whaddya see?
Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way.
Oh, we were helping Chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out because Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions.
Marcel?
Hi, I'm selling Brown Bird cookies.
Hey.
Ohh, it's Joey! I love Joey!
Yeah, I recognize the ankles!
Hey Rach!
I just, I had to see you one more time before you took-off.
So you don't wanna go to Williamsburg?
And-and I, and I saw that Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of him to-to surprise him and, and then I pretended I didn't know he was in there.
I'm sorry, I've got plans with my sister.
This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole "We were on a break thing?" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me?
Oh great. So all I need to do is get some new skin. Thank you.
I know it is pretty unbelievaaaaah.
What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?
Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses.
Hey!
Yeah, no, you're right, I know, you're right, I'm not, I'm not gonna do it. All right, thanks guys.
I'm going to China.
Hey, there.
I didn't know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn't finish the whole letter!
OK, fine, well I'm not gonna watch, alright.
Ross.
Marcel! Where are you going with that disc?
And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore.
Oh I'm, I'm making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do.
And, I came up with Atlantic City.
OK sweetie, I'll see you later.
Listen, I'm ah, I'm sorry I've been so crazy and jealous and, it's just that I like you a lot, so...
And bus.
Ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym.
Well you said you couldn't go out so....
Okay, okay, I'll tell 'em it wasn't Chandler who got high. Now who should I say it was?
Any time.
Uhh, okay, it's uh, Emily and I, we decided to uh, to get married.
Well, Chandler and I are in a bar...
No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?
What are you doing? We're going to a hospital.
Good.
Yeah, I uh, totally forgot about that. You mind if I take a rain check? I'm waiting for a call from Emily.
You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
Really?
Yes, her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow.
I could, yeah, I can do that.
But-but, Liam's on my team.
I mean, I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.
How do you know? I mean we thought Carol was straight before I married her!
Uh, no, it's-it's just this person.
That is one good looking man!
All right, the score is nine to eight in favor of the guys. Ladies if you miss this the game is theirs, pick your category.
So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?
Oh! Well then this is awkward. So what do you uh...
Yeah.
Huh. Sounds like Mark Something wants to have some sex.
When, when were you... under me? Rach. Rachel do you, I mean, were you, uh. . . What?
Damn! I can't believe I took her off my list.
Woah, woah, woah australopithicus isn't supposed to be in that display. No. No. No, n, homo-habilus was erect, australopithicus was never fully erect.
Did you see me write one down?
Hey Pheebs, what 'cha reading? Pheebs? Hello? Phoebe? Phoe-Phoebe! Come on!
Okay.
Yeah.
Hey! Hey! If he's moving, maybe I should try to get his place!
Come on!
Yeah, yeah, it'll be great! You can, you can lay on the beach and I can cry over my failed marriage. See-see how I make jokes?
Par-tay!
Hey!
Wow, hello! You look great!
Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that.
I got it!
Oh, yumm!
Come on, I think this is a good thing. I don't think Mom would've hired you if she didn't think you were good at what you do.
Oh, hey, Gunther, check this out.
Okay! Hey Tommy.
That's not what this is about okay? I-I am a sports car enthusiast. I have always been into cars.
See, I see.... big passion in your future.
Me either...
My God.
That's impossible, he's got a twinkie in the city.
Stopped for a Chunky.
Come here.
Monica!
Divorced men's club.
No! And I'm not gonna be, so you can save you little speech.
Yeah.
Yeah but Pottery Barn! Y'know what I think? It's just she-she's weird. Y'know it's because she's a twin. Twins are weird.
What?
You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
Oh you guys, I-I really think just one of us should go out there so she's not overwhelmed...
Wow, that's-that's-that's incredible.
Yeah, I think she looks good.
Is that what I want?
You're on!
Hi, did you order some bananas?
Yeah?
Mon.
Are you sure? Hold on. I'm sorry you guys, that was a coffee and a....
Who the hell is Jordie?
His daughter was hot.
Uhh, believe me when he's older, he'll understand.
Besides, there's a big age difference.
Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah...
This is the coolest house ever!!
Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head! Straight up over your head! You can do it! You can do it! Okay. You got it?
Going out with who?
What?!!!
They make you take an oath?
No problem.
That's right, he's not Drake, he's Hans Remore, Drake's evil twin.
Uh-huh. Hey, here you go buddy. Sorry, no porn for you. Okay, let's go see Monica!
What?
Happy birthday!!!
Good, so everybody's here. Everybody's good. So, were you gonna play something, Phoebe?
Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back- come here, Marcel-
I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.
Oh. Wow! Huh. Boy! Well, someone's been doing their homework.
Come here, Marcel. Sit here.
No, I mean, look I don't know if anything is going to happen with us, again. Ever. But I don't want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector.
C'mon, tell us.
Actually that-that's not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No. 72, Dr. Bruce Banner found... Y'know, ugh, nevermind, my girlfriend's a lesbian.
Yeah.
I know, it's crazy! We were just pushing Ben on the swings...
Hey Rach. I, uh, got you a little present. . . I'll open it. It's a Slinky! Remember, huh. Walks down stairs, alone or in pairs, everyone knows it's. . . just a big spring. Alright, you still mad at me becuase of the whole. . .
Chandler? Chandler?
Yeah, I know, so what? I mean, who's-who's to say? Does that me we-we can't do it? Look, huh, I was with Carol for four years before we got married and I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian. I mean, this, this makes sense for us. Come on! I mean, on our first date we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont! I mean, last night I got my ear pierced! Me! This feels right. Doesn't it?
All right-all right, fine! I-I'm gonna call the cops!
What dog? There-there's no dog here.
All right, see you guys.
Cousin Frannie's wedding, its tomorrow night.
Maybe it's uh Sergeant Sagittarius coming back to flirt some more!
Ohh! A man with a plan!
That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I use your bathroom?
Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it.
I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.
Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we're face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we're-we're butt to face.
Good evening, sir. My name is Ross Geller. I'm one of the people who applied for the apartment. And I-I realize that the competition is fierce but-I'm sorry. I, I can't help but notice you're naked and I applaud you. Man, I wish I was naked. I mean, this-this looks so great. That is how God intended it.
Yeah.
Okay, then why do you have to wear underwear tonight?
So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That there's nothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!
Right?
I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus. Huh?
It's hard to tell because I'm sweating, but I use exactly what the gel bottle says, an amount about the size of a pea. How, how can that be too much?
Who is Maria?
Yeah.
Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.
Huh?
Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid.
Are you trying to get me to bribe you?
Who wants to make some long distance calls?
Are you jealous?
Okay. You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.
No, but it's-it's-it's hot!
Well, I'm gonna go see her. I want to bring her something, what do you think she'll like?
Hi!
No. So, um, let's see your pretty close, huh. Make-up's on, hair's done.
Good! That's good!
How come it's always us left in the field holding the ball?
Hi.
At the coffeehouse, right.
No! No! I...didn't do that. It's just... Okay, honestly no. I don't, I don't see a big future with her.
Well... not in the same way...
Uh, just a sec dad. OK, be cool, just be cool. OK dad.
Mm.
OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?
Well, we won't wanna raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh, Scarsdale.
Umm, uh, I was just telling the guys...
Ni-chou chi-ma!
Die Hard!!!!!!
Do they wait for me to do this?
Hey. Uh, Chan, can I uh, can I talk to you for a second?
Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.
What?
Uhh, yeah. I mean, actually I kinda think that we'll have, we'll have two babies.
MY SANDWICH!!!!!!
Look, you wanna get off my back?
D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?
Yeah.
Where's Ben?
Yeah.
Hey!
A basket of mini-muffins.
Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clock's a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes. Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes? Twice?
Oh, you have some studying to do?
To wear in front of people?
I had just moved in. Thank you! Listen umm...
Hi, welcome, to an adult conversation.
Gunther?!
We're fine, we're fine.
Well yeah, but she doesn't know that. I mean, the last time she saw you-you would've turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling.
I know that!
Huh?
Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me?
Naa. A while ago I got a sah out of him, which I thought, ya know, might turn into sah-condary caregiver but... Hey, would you uh, would you hold him for a sec, 'cause I, I gotta take this off.
Oh hey, don't thank me, thank yourself. You're the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them.
Yes, we have to tell her!
Yeah? How much?
Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen.
Really? No. I mean, nah, I haven't played in so long, and-and, well it's-it's really personal stuff, y'know?
Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway.
Doctor Burke is sexy?
Oww!! My ankle! I really hurt my ankle! I think I twisted it when I-Ooh, a quarter!
No.
Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y'know? You, you were great. ...Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for, uh, something grape?
No, you've heard my practice. Okay? Just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want. And I'm not going to tell you what song I'm gonna play either. But uh, let's just say when it's over I'll bet there will be a we bit o' celebration.
Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?
No.
Hey!
Dude, we are sooo gonna party!
I'm sorry, my pie was, was in your hood. Now I just have to get the coffee out of that guy's pants and I'll be back in the hospital by 7.
All right.
What? What-what, what are talking about? It-it worked with you.
Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica. Oh, I guess he doesn't feel like talking right now. He's smiling though! Okay, talk to you later.
What the? What...
What do you like better flora or fauna?
I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid.
It's a legitimate learning technique. Wow!
What's going on?
No anchovies.
You were at the coffeehouse!
Uh fellas,
Will you-will you please?
Bye.
Hey! Y'know that teacher who had a baby with her student?
Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesn't really have any close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan something, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think it's gonna make a difference
Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-
Catch any big fish?
And why do you care so much?
Hey! So ah, what did the insurance company say?
Yes! You're the person who checked out my book?!
Oh, I am very in.
You'll see.
Yeah. And you should hold out for something bigger. I can't tell you how much respect I have for you not going to that stupid cab driver audition.
'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..?
That's all right, Rach, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my sister Monica. This is Chandler. Phoebe. Joey, what up?
Hi.
Ugh.
What?
Well I, close your eyes, I just think you're gonna like this a little better, 'cause, close-close...
It's heads. Gentlemen, pick your category.
That's impossible! I mean we have had a deal for years! We-we-we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that.
Yeah alright.
Doubtful.
Okay, well here we are. Now we're in a tough spot again, Rach. What do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do you wanna bail? Look, I, I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing. Okay? And I'm sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I can't. I just can't see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much.
Yeah, listen...
You-you-you-you threw my sandwich away!
I'm asking you to do me a favor.
What?
Phoebe, are you, are you mad at me, or something? 'Cause if are please, tell me what it is I did!
Hey!
Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?
She may have died.
hey, fella! How you doing?
Oh my God, is that still...
Ohh, yeah I already have one.
What, now?
Oh my God. Oh my God! And you're-you're...you're not freaking out?
Yeah.
The small one.
Yeah Pheebs, come on, you two have completely different styles. Y'know, she's more.. y'know, and you're more
Oh God, here we go!
Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.
Okay.
Yeah, I didn't think of that.
No, you stop!
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, it was, nah, well....
I don't even wanna hear it, you're just...
Yeah, I'll take some.
Tuesday right. Ok, bye you guys.
Oh what?! Is she gonna cancel on me again?! How can she do this? Doesn't she know it's our anniversary?
Yes, very nice Rachel.
Well, Emily's willing to work on the relationship.
Monica, uh Dad called this morning and ah, Aunt Silvia passed away.
Yes. Yes I do.
C'mon, just tell me, please, please.
Oh my God, he just said your name, that's great! Good job Ben.
Why aren't you guys dressed?
No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a different joke than I thought-it wasn't that funny. So I'm still torn.
No, no, no I don't want to know, don't want to know. Ok, you know, I should probably, I should probably just go.
Oh yeah, Emily convinced me to do it.
Hey, come on in.
Oh yeah! Wasn't she uh...
Hey!
Here you go.
The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?
Well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totally benign.
No no no, go-
You wanna explain that?
Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that much trouble.
That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.
Oh look, I can't believe this. Look, homo-habilus hasn't even learned how to use tools yet and they've got him here wi, with clay pots. Why don't, why don't they just give him a microwave? I'm sorry, I'm sorry this is taking so long, ya know, I, I, it's just it's longer than I expected, we will have dinner.
And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!
I'm sorry I'm late, did I miss anything?
Can I have everyone's attention please? I'm uh; I'm Ross Geller.
Rach, y'know I can see you naked any time I want.
Got me.
Oh, I don't, I don't, I don't know...
No really, I-I am! I feel bad!
Okay! You take care!
this summer?
They're still, they're still not coming on man and the lotion and the powder have made a paste!
What do you mean, they're not moving in? They-they're still moving in right?
Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.
Okay dad.
So, are you gonna see him again?
Oh, that's not true! I've got her lots of stuff she never took back.
What?
How weird is that? Y'know? You're moving in with me and have the one thing I don't have. It's like uh, in a way you-you complete me kitchen.
Oh look, did, did you just see that? Did you see? He just waved, he just waved, he's never waved before, you've never waved before. Yes he has. Very good.
Okay.
Order a pizza like, 'I forgive you?'
Yeah, it's the Ultimate Fighting Combo. Yeah, I saved thirty cents, plus I get to keep the cup. Yay!!
Oh, that's me.
Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room?
Action.
It'll be okay Joe.
Hey, y'know what? Not all spring breaks are like that.
I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something.
Yeah?
Hey!
Yeah, but it didn't fit. Well, luckily there's a store here that has one left in her size, but I'm the groom, I'm not supposed to see the dress...
Susan...
And what are you going to do for him?
Aww, come on.
Gentlemen, you're pick.
What are you doing?
No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I'm happy for ya, but I'm tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don't know what to do anymore.
When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?
Phoebe, how could you do this to me?!
Monica?
What?
I'm Ross Geller. Wha, I'm, God in your add you said you were pretty but wow.
Why?! Why on the lips?!
Whip it out, whip it out.
No. I... I wanted to be with you. I don't know, I feel like lately, I feel like you're slipping away from me, y'know. With this new job, and all these new people, and you've got this whole other life going on. I-I-I know it's dumb, but I hate that I'm not a part of it.
Hey Ross! It's you! I just want you to remember this feeling. You are lucky to be alive! So live everyday to the fullest. Love yourself, okay? Okay. Oh, and also get stamps. Bye!
That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up.
I-I-I don't even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it. Y'know what? I'm just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks.
All right Pheebs, your cab's ready.
Uh-huh, Carol, so were we. All right, just-just imagine for a moment, Susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. Y'know? Say-say they're coming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks, they're laughing, y'know, someone innocently touches someone else... There's electricity, it's new. It's exciting. Are you telling me there isn't even the slightest possibility of something happening?
Oh, you and me?
Good-good-good.
Look, I am totally, totally over her, OK, I just... : Hiiii!
What's her last name?
Check it out! Almost 3 hours without droppin' it!
Hi.
I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.
Why would I tell him?
I'm done.
Really?
Dude!
Y'know, okay. You're right. It is huge. So why don't we take it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm, forget getting married for a sec; just forget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower?
All right, look, look, you've got to do this yourself, okay in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.
Okay. Uh, huh. Excuse me, I'm sorry, I-I think you may be in our seats.
Ohh.
What are you talking about?
Nu-uh!
Nothing, I'm-I'm just, I'm so comfortable with you!
Well, not right now. Okay look, Monica came here for some memories and damnit, we're gonna give her some! Okay, grab...grab some empty boxes. Okay? We'll-we'll take stuff from mine and whatever we can pass off as hers we'll-we'll put 'em in their.
Well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don't uh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they're related to.
I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain.
This is a girl that I really like and had too swoop in there!
Hey!
Not, not, not every night. You know, and... and it's not like I didn't try, Rachel, but things got in the way, y'know? Like, like Italian guys or ex-fiances or, or, or Italian guys.
Good-good, I'm-I'm married.
What do you mean?
What are you doing?
Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?
She does want to.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, she's here.
Yeah.
No, come on don't start. Ouch!
We're looking into it.
You see this, this is a person who is ready to go. Phoebe you, oh, you are my star.
...What shoe?
Oh, you know the sex of the baby? Oh, oh-oh-oh!
Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so.
Thank you.
I-I had to show Chandler something?
Oh.. oh... oh.
Mmm. Oh, no-
Well, I called over there and it turns out Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it himself and he's already had like a hundred applicants.
I know.
Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak...out. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you.
Yours, I just got 43 points for 'KIDNEY'.
Hi.
Real magic does exist.
No one got me an engagement present.
What's wrong with being the Bings?
No the man's right, that's what I had with Rachel.
Hey guys!
How could I forget?
Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets?
Ah, which, which one?
Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...
Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins. It was the best day.
It was, it was great. Oh, what happened?
Okay, you're in bed. She's over on your side, cuddling. Now you wait for her to drift off, and then you hug her and roll her back over to her side of the bed. And then you rollll a-way. Hug for her! Roll for you.
I've had better.
...everyone, this is Chandler!
No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?!
Really?
What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.
Yes!! Yes!!!
Okay, okay, we'll just get everyone to act like they like it. That-that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to Sweet Potatoe Pie!
Yeah.
So, uh, how's she doing?
Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?
Actually, no, we're not.
Look who I found standing outside of the Szechwan Dragon staring at a parking meter.
There was never a good time.
Yeah, but we-we have to be at the Four Seasons for drinks in 15 minutes and then y'know, then The Plaza for dinner.
I'd bet I'd still be doing my kara-tay. Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y'know, not doing anything else physical.
You need to get some sleep.
Hey, here's a question; where did you guys get the finest oak East of the Mississippi?
Okay. You uh, you wanna hear something weird?
It-it-The point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.
How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange?
All right I guess I'm, gonna go pack.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it.
Yeah! Rach?
Hey!
Ohh, it was the best!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's with the tackling?
Uh, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to take a moment, just me and him.
All right. Okay, here we go!
This couch, is cut in half! I would like to exchange it for one that is not cut in half!
Okay, good-good for you.
I.....got.....dressed. Really, really quickly. Okay, okay. There we go, there we go.
Oh, no! No!
Hi.
Yeah! Yeah! Oh, this will make a great memory.
Yeah-no, just that last song.
Ohh. . . Thanks Rach, goodnight.
Oh my God.
Hey, someone order a coat?
Okay, y'know what, let's just cut to the chase here. Okay? Heidi, which of my boys do you like?
Hey Joe, while you're over there how about another beer for the Ross-A-Tron?
Yay!
Cannot feel my tounge.
No! That's-that's my arm!
You are such a tattletale! Mom, Dad, you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana?
Hey, remember when I had a monkey?
Look, I'm sorry.
Or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans. He does that every week too.
Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.
Ugh. Well, we're just gonna have to jump. Yeah. Now, we're gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay? Not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownish red stuff in the middle. So, when you get down there...you go up to the roof and you let me in.
God no!
Why, why, why would you dream that?
I got it at Pottery Barn!! Okay?!
What?!
Yeah. You see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Her secret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; I call it the Moist Maker. Anyway, I-I put my sandwich in the fridge over here...
Ahh, sorry, nothing you can do about it. It's one of my ah, rights as the ex-boyfriend. Oop, oh yeah!
Hi.
Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil.
Before I forget, are we hitting faces?
No, no-no, Ross Geller.
Excuse me, your, your, your wind?
Well, Monica keeps changin' the channel.
No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Pretty sure, they both think I'm interested in them.
A thumb?!
Yeah, okay, hold on! They're not coming on man.
Well, so, you-you'll get a job here! I mean, I'm always hearing about uh, them foreigners coming in here and stealing American jobs; that could be you!
Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.
And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress.
I am a good kisser.
Ohhh, hey! All right, listen, I-I have that TV thing in like two hours, and I need your help, okay? What do you think? This blue suit, or this brown one?
Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the- -the bus stop... I'm fine.
Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey.
Whoa-oh, okay! Yeah, why am I telling you that?
Hey.
No, it's my joke, it's mine. You can call them, they'll tell you.
Wait, wait, wait.
Uh, nothing, nothing's with him. Enjoy your coffee.
Okay, each team will answer ten questions. The first team that answers the most questions wins. Okay, the categories are, Fears and Pet Peeves, Ancient History, Literature, and It's All Relative. Now, the coin toss to see who goes first. Okay, somebody call it this time.
And, uh, and then I kissed her.
Ohh! Thank you! I like mail.
Pheebs, did...you want a cookie?
Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin' guy.
Waitohheyhuh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!
Oh my God. But the zoo told me that my monkey was dead.
No, not a problem.
Yeah.
What?!
Oh OK. Well then why don't you, uhh, why don't you borrow it from mom and dad? You feel guilty and tense around them already. You might as well make some money off of them.
No, no, don't. Why don't we?
No, not since I lost her at the airport.
Chandler?! You brought Chandler?! The next best thing would be Monica!
Hmm?
No, there is no way he was a velociraptor. No Tony, look at the cranial ridge, OK. If Dino was a velociraptor, he would have eaten the Flintstones. Yeah, yeah. Oh, were you takin' a nap?
Yeah? Sometimes it's...
Was I talking to her about gas?
Sorry, I'm kinda keeping this one on the Q.T.
...will be two months...
What?! What?!
Hi.
I hear ya.
OK, tip the man.
And that's what's gonna kill me. I'm allergic to kiwi.
Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe goind into the robot, y'know?
You're right, you're right, it is.
Blah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blaaaaaah....
No, Rachel doesn't want me to....
No, no, she's great and it's not like we haven't done anything. I mean, uh, uh, we, we do plenty of other stuff, lot's of other stuff, like uhh. . .
Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?
Yeah but Phoebs, what about the end?
This is weird for me!
Well umm, oh! I might be teaching another class this semester!
Of Ross and Rachel.
Yeah! Oh, I-I love this babies!
Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us? 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.
Of course I am! Okay, let's go godfather.
Yeah, so uh, is it sore or can you do stuff?
What?! What does he want?! I wasn't doing anything!
Oh, hey hey hey, ho ho ho, hello, guy who doesn't want to know, standing right here!
I don't know, I-I was all high.
Okay! Hey!
Whoa, hey! What are doing? Trying to get me drunk?
HEY, SHE'S FAST!! OKAY?!! Oh! You-you think you can be beat me? Let's go! Outside!!
Are you kidding?!
But work comes first! Oh hey, but that's sad about you though, what happened? Burn out? Burn all out, did ya?
What?!
So, uh, why did you have to turn it down?
Yeah?
No, no, they will. I just... uh...
Oh my-Come here! Come here! It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay.
Oh wait-hold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.
Okay! Umm, I uh, I'm your teacher. I'm sorry, you're-you're a student and I-and I like women. In spite of what may be written on the backs of some of these chairs.
Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh...
Yeah, it really was!
I dunno, there's just something about...
Meth-methane smells...
Look, I gotta go pick up Ben. Everything so far sounds great Joey, just remember to keep it on the mellow side, okay? Just a couple of guys hanging out playing poker, no-no strippers or anything okay?
Well what is it? Is it a mole?
Uh... Oh hey, do you, uh ...do you have any, um, Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?
Well that's the first time we've said that.
Look, this is hard enough! I really need you guys right now.
No? What happened, big guy?
I love it, when we share.
Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I'm not invited to sleep-overs.
Wh-why?! Why-why-why would it, why would it be weird?
Oh, no-no-no don't you worry about me falling asleep. I still have your letter!!!
Twice.
Totally.
Yeah! I don't know. I mean, last year Elizabeth now-now this kid. What-what-what-what is it?! Am I giving out some kind of...sexy professor vibe?
Oh my God. I mean...
Phoebe really likes the bike huh?
Uh, what you said, about us being in a place where we could finally be happy for each other.
Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for Dances With Wolves and that one guy cut in line in front of us and I just lost it?! Screamed at him! Turned all red! Red Ross!!
Well hello! She's cute! Should we uh, go try to talk to her?
Hello?
Better not be doin' these in order.
Then don't do that, alright?
What? Come on Rach, tell me what you're thinking?
I Ross...
Then tell him quickly.
Yeah.
Well, I guess I'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is.
Fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yoghurt, or something..
Ohh!
Oh, nothin' much. Just trying to figure out what I'm gonna do for dinner.
Just stuff. Y'know kinda what Emily wants.
Over my dead body!
Phoebe?
Okay, I'm gonna get your coat and then I'll-I'll put you in a cab.
I-I'm, I'm having a boy?
What? Is it the comet?
Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me, I just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips.
Am I?!
That's not advice!
So?
What did you get?
No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo.
That's crap!! Sister Brown Bird. Good going.
Fine, fine, Rachel your with Monica, Joey you're with me.
Oh yeah, about telling Mom and Dad, I was thinking about maybe writing a letter.
Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately.
I can't believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in. Man, some-some stranger's gonna be living in my room.
Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the Cupert-Hewitt museum.
WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!
Y'know, maybe she is too young for me. Y'know, when I was over there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby-sitter. I finally started to see what you guys were talking about. I don't know what to do.
Let go! Let go!
This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.
Huh? Yeah, fine, invite whoever you want.
Hey, you know what I just realized? If you guys ever have kids...
She's not- past, she's present, she's back.
Susan wanted a Chunky. We're having a baby, ok, a baby, you don't stop for Chunkys.
No.
Hi! It's me.
All right then.
Yes, but also Hanukkah! See, you're part Jewish, and-and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday.
Why? What?
I don't see why not.
All right. All right, I'm gonna do it!
Yes, yes!
You understand I don't actually like 8-year-old boys.
Excuse me, do any of you know how to play?
Hey!
So, we're off.
I would never do that!
Oh-oh, absolutely!
Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I'll show the sexy teller that I am a published writer.
Is that so?
Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do not love her.
Hey, hey buddy, Marcel. Marcel. In the jungle, the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight. In the jungle, the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight. a-weema-way, a-weema-way.....
Of course I was mad! I told you I-I hate this stuff! Okay? It-it's not funny!
Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!
Rach!
That only took me an hour.
Hi.
I can't believe this!!
Come on, would you grow up? It's no big deal.
I'm sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but I-look, I just want you guys to be safe. DANGER!!!!! Ahhh, huh? Unagi.
Oh yeah.
Naked friends.
Hmm-Hmm.
Honey. Honey, have you seen my Harmon Kilerbrew bat? Bob doesn't believe I have one.
Sweetie, calm down, it's gonna be okay.
I bet two dollars.
Emily? Emily? I'm coming in.
Hey!
C'mon Monica, do it. Hey, you guys, um, Monica has some news.
So Rachel called. Wants to see me. Going over in a minute.
Listen, I gotta tell ya, I-I'm having a great time! Y'know how before you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank I thought it would be too, but it's not. I mean it's not at all.
He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!
I just wanna read something. It's your pro list.
So, what? That's it?
Whoa, hello, did you just meet Monica?
See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.
Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me!
Phoebs, It's open! It's open!
Yeah, but wait...
That audition.
We met at Phoebe's birthday party, I'm, I'm Ross Geller.
Umm, he said he thought I was funny. So... Okay, look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all about it.
Go ahead, go ahead with the bird. Ok, do you have anything for around 200?
Okay, why are you here?
I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.
Let's show 'em.
So do I. Okay Rach, before anything happens I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules. This is just about tonight. I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of "Us." Okay? I just want this to be about what it is!
Hi.
What? What? What?!
Hey everyone!
Thanks man.
Excuse me?
They're not a couple!
Who's that?
Hi!
And you had no idea they weren't getting along?
It's ok. I'm sorry.
Can't do it, can you?
Yeah, right!
Hey Pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my new......old sheet?
Okay, okay, fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yogart, or something..
Hey Pheebs! How's that uh, vegetarian pizza working out for ya? You and those vegetables have a real thing going on, huh?
Sorry.
There you go. So she dips into her savings, that's what it's there for. She's gonna be fine, and if you need a little extra, you know where to find it.
Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel.
And it works both ways.
My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?! H-how?! How could this all happen?!
Well umm...
That's cool.
Don't thank me! If you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization. Here's Warren's number.
All right, let's not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was some sexual chemistry between them.
No.
Okay.
Well, if he's angry, he really shouldn't just cover it up. I-I wish he would just tell me the truth.
Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us.
Yes! No-no! I know, I know what the list is! Mom! Look if you see Chandler, could you just let him know I'm looking for him?
Yeah, which was nice.
Exactly. So you didn't, didn't mention anything to Issac right?
Uh, uh, well you're, umm, you're my lobster.
Getting it away from me would be job one.
Oh, I'll-I'll come hug you.
I'm fine. Just-just... having my worst fear realised...
I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do stand up and shout 'Hey, Rachel, your butt is showing!'
Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you?
Yeah.
High collar and baggy pants say I'm a pro.
Shut up.
Actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era.
Hey, guys!
Good luck!
And, and uh, you-you remember my friend Chandler.
Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?
Ahh.
Really like those Macadamia nuts, huh?
S-s-smell her hair? What if I did?
So uh, Rach? Does it, does it feel weird around here now? Y'know since I've been away at college.
Yeah, yeah, it'll be great! You can, you can lay on the beach and I can cry over my failed marriage. See-see how I make jokes?
You mean, we-you and me?
No, but it is frowned upon.
I fell asleep!
Joey-
I'm having a boy! I-I'm having a boy!
For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?
I found a note on my door, "Come to Monica's quick, bring champagne and a Three Musketeers bar."
Yeah?
Mmmm.
Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.
Rachel! I'll just call her back.
Ahh, no.
You're not going to go.
You didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to you.
No. No-no uh, he just, he just really freaked me out before.
Rach! Rach!
Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win?
Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!
C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.
These-these are beads of joy.
Breathe.
Oh please, can't I come to your special, magical cabin?
Good morning. Nice breasts by the way.
All right, I gotta go. I'm taking Ben to the park.
No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even met Howard. I-I mean I don't know Howard.
Damn, I forgot you were here.
It's a little early to be drinkin'.
So Pheebs, are you gonna go back out there or what?
There we go. All better.
Okay?
Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.
Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to.
The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?
You see, and you thought she'd be judgemental.
I like this one. It seems to say, "I love you and that's why I have to kill you."
No, not you.
Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and I can find my way out of there like that!
It didn't.
Hi.
Hey, how's it going?
What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon, he's not that bad.
No, no, no. I'm not in the zone.
Hi!
Look I-I realize if anything were to happen with me and Jill then nothing could ever happen with us!
Ahh.
Kinda like a big face without skin.
Ok. No, hey, whoa, whoa, I'll get your coat.
What?
Okey-dokey!
Oh! That's nice.
11, unbelievable 11 is correct. All right, that's 4 for the guys. Ladies, you're up.
Yes!
Yeah, but not very well, unless 14-across, 'Gershwin musical' actually is bitemebitemebitemebiteme.
What?
Wow! I didn't know that there was a Pottery Barn up here.
C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch...
'Kay!
Yeah, laugh all you want but in ten minutes we're gonna have younger looking skin!
What, what is it?
Okay. You know that I-I have to go.
No Rach! Come on! No-no! Yeah, I'm sure we won't get arrested for this.
Yeah.
Maybe this would've happened if I'd been more nurturing, or I'd paid more attention, or I... had a uterus. I can't believe this!
Yes? Yes?! How can I help you?
Anyway, suddenly I'm down field, and I realise that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See I, I am so not ready to be a father.
Yeah.
I may not know any of your flash dances but I'm no slouch on the dance floor.
Hey I'm sorry to do this to you again but uh, is there any way you can look after Ben for a little bit? I-I've got this meeting at school. And-and he-he asked for his uh, 'Fun Aunt' Rachel, so...
Come on you guys, it's no big deal!
Just, just say what you feel.
Well, you can't know where I am all the time. Look, this marriage is never gonna work if you don't trust me.
Buddy, my monkey, my monkey.
Okay umm, why don't we all take a seat, y'know? And uh, and I'll get us all some uh some coffees--Yeah, why don't you. Uh and you guys can talk about whatever, whatever you want. Y'know? Whatever pops into your head.
Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn't say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.
No!
Breathe.
I'm gonna, I'm gonna go to London and I'm going to fight for her.
Did you see me? I was pretty good, huh? That is one fun game!
Pheebs, we had the most incredible night! Okay, so, we're in the car...
What?! That's not gonna make you any money!
Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...
Well, you can help me!
What?
What?
Okay, please-please Paul, just let me explain...
Oh-oh, you're-you're fellow scholars. What exactly were you looking for, hmm? Perhaps, perhaps Dr. Chester Stock's musings on the Smiledon Californicus?
Ooh, I, I'm so sick of missing stuff. Ya know, I want him for more than, than a day, I want him for a whole weekend. No listen , I mean, I feel like-
What? I'm kidding. You know I'd never let him touch the Porsche.
Monica!
Naa.
There y'go.
I've never walked down the aisle knowing it can't end in divorce.
OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning...
Well, if-if she thought they were on a break...
No! Oh, no-no-no. Hey, you weren't bad, you've been very good, Ben.
Oke-dokey.
As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, until death parts us. Really, I do. Emily.
Okay.
Really.
Humm, that sounds, I don't, perfect.
Most of you don't know me, I'm Rachel's boyfriend.
You're right. That's very different. So let's, let's just sign the papers. All right? What?
No, you let me fini...
So let's decide on the spending limit...
Nooo!
Hey!
So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?
Gimme the this!
That doesn't matter. She wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we know, Bob is who she was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness.
Oh God!
What happened?
Number six: the way you smell.
Yeah!
Got me.
No, no, I was turnin' the knob and, and. . . here it is.
Tell me about it.
Hey, hey Rach!
Well..
All right, ready?
What? What? What? What is it?
Yes, professor Feesen-sen-stenlger... I'll be with you in one moment. So, I will take one box of the Thin Mints.
Bye guys.
May I come in?
No, no, don't, don't, rub it! Don't! What gets out hummus?! What gets out hummus?!
By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me.
Let's give it a shot.
Okay, fine!
Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it.
What?
So?
Your make-up!
Yes, yes it is! No, but it's good it's-Emily thinks we should get all new stuff. Stuff that's just ours, together. Y'know brand new.
Well, these. These are yours right here.
Hi.
...Yeah?
You couldn't let me have her, could ya?!
All right everyone, lift! And slide!!
Hey. Rachel, I-I-I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now and I really, I just have to get it out.
No! No! No!
No! Why?
Oh my God! Rachel Green?
G'night.
Is everything ok?
Look, I didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep.
But, um... I don't think that's going to be you.
Sure. By the way, there's a difference between being obsessive and. . .
How hot is this?!
Cat.
It just amazes me that your still pulling stuff like this.
Come on.
Because it's breast milk. It's gross.
Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world.
Okay. Wow! This is going so well. Did you see us? Did you see?
Oh God, thank you! Umm, uh, Mr. Stevens I'd like you to meet my friends uh, this is Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler.
Yeah, sure.
Emily!
Hello, baby. Hello, hello.
OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
How's the maniac?
Okay, how about you flew to London to stop my wedding! Ah, how about you told me you loved me after I was already married!
Hey.
No, hi, I'm, I'm an honorary Brown Bird
Hi.
Okay, good luck
Well, it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woo-hoo. That means, that means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girl's bodies, waking up next to people you don't even know...
I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.
Okay. But not about this!
Here. At least I made ten bucks in my relationship.
Uh-huh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so, I took it.
No, it's just...you know the whole "getting on with your life" thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. And um, and then I'm here talkin' to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to...You know, here's a wacky thought. Um, what's say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know. You can't deny it. Besides, you're carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see, you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. I love you.
It is! It is!
No, no, uh, it's not what you think. It's um the other thing.
Look, it's just a little more complicated...
Hey! Oh, we-we can't keep eating like this.
I just asked that girl out.
Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about the night of five times?
I just grabbed a spoon.
No, Rach, come on. Rach! Rach, no, no! She's not Rachel, she is, she is not, Ra--Rachel?
It's just I miss her so much.
No! I talked to Joey on the set, he hasn't heard from him. I-I-I talked to Chandler's parents again!
Well, I'd love to! Here, you wait right here and I'll go get the projector and my notes!
Okay! Okay. Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.
Monica!
I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!
Well I-I-I don't care how hot it is it's-it's uh, it's wrong.
Okay. So uh, well, this-this is uh, this is awkward.
Oh that is quite all right ma'am.
Who would you rather be Simon or Garfunkle?
All right.
All right, show's over. Nothing to see here. Ok, let's do laundry.
What-what is it?!
C'mon.
Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date. She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not broad backed!
Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too?
Okay. Honey?
Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi.
Of course, what happened?
Hey, don't we have to...
Awww, man! Really?
Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.
Why not?
Yeah.
You got me a cola drink?
You can see the moonlight bouncing off her head! What the hell were you thinking?!!
Wha, OK, I'm sorry, let's uh, why don't we find someplace else.
No! No! I'm not! It's-it's-it's perfect! I mean it's better than you just-just moving here, 'cause it's us together forever, and that's-that's what I want.
Well, Mon, I was married.
Hmm.
Hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about?
Come on, let's go!
Hey!
Emily, hi! Uh, how-how was you flight?
Mmm hmmm.
I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job.
Please tell me you're joking.
Oh, I was unbelievable.
Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the museum.
Really?
Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too.
Hi!
I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?
I'm kinda beat.
In this life, Phoebe.
Oh I'm, I'm making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do.
Cigarettes?!!
You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
Hey. How did, uh, how'd it go today?
Yeah, Susan.
It's from Ross, it's a love bug.
So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
Okay! Now, I'm going to touch you. Ohh, that's soft.
Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn't actually land on the moon. But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely.
Maybe not.
Hey.
Probably around gonorrhea.
Oh my God, the pages are stuck together!
What?
Awww.
"Hi Rach, are you there? It's me, pick up. Rachel. Rach!"
So uh, have a great time down there.
No.
No. I'm saying it's now.
Sure, what do you got?
I'm not going to do that.
Marcel? Marcel? Okay, where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel?
Wh- are you welling up?
Wow, well uh, uh, actually, Julie's downstairs getting a cab, I just need the cat toy, did Monica say. . . What? Why, why are you looking at me like that?
Dude, I need to talk to you a sec.
Hey there little fella! Hey, uh-hey, why don't we get some shoes on ya, huh? Hey, why don't you show dad how you can put your shoes on, in your room! Yay!!
Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum.
Events from around the globe.
Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York, I'm sure everything will be fine.
Argh!
Hey!
I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.
Good call!
Check it out, he actually is the MonkeyShine monkey.
She is not... She's gay. Oh my God. She is so gay! I can't believe this.
No, no way. You've got it totally the other way around my friend. John Voit was...
How sad are we?
Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.
Hey!
I just wanna check something.
C'mon, what's his name?
Y'see, that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian?
Petty...
Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought I'd have to talk you into this more.
I know.
'Pwease, Aunt Monica, pwease?' Oh, unclench. You're not even gonna be there.
We, we just decided to uh, to go for it.
Uh, hello, the buzzer buzzed. It doesn't count.
Y'know, I don't think we're going to settle this.
It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech.
Ok, do you have any ideas for any openers?
Well I don't know umm, what if we were too tie each other up? Umm, some people eat stuff off one another. Nah! Umm, y'know we-we could try dirty talk? Umm, we could, we could have a threesome.
Phoebe! You're note, amazing! Not only did no one touch my sandwich, but people at work are actually afraid of me. Yeah, a guy called me mental! Mental Geller, yeah, I always wanted a cool nickname like that.
Y'know what? I'm good! I'm good!
Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.
Also an island.
You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called "a globe?" Hmm?
Ok, ok, sweetheart, I'll see you later. Ok, bye. What? Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three. Well you didn't hang up either.
Okay, come on! All right, I gotta go! So good luck at the party. Okay?
Why am I not surprised?
It's a girl! Anyway, it wou-it wouldn't matter. Okay? Because I'm a teacher and she's a student.
I can't catch a break!
Lo que sucedio es que no le gusta la tele!
So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...
Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.
Look, I don't think so Pheebs. All right, I'll do it. But just because you're a friend.
All right.
Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it.
Five letters.
Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!
Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...
I tired attacking two women, did not work.
Oh-ho, okay.
Yeah, ever since you uh, told me that story about that bike I-I couldn't stop thinking about it. I mean, everyone should have a-a first bike, so...
Y'know what would cheer you up?
Thanks a lot.
This is not fun!
Err, right.
Although I was married to her.
You bought Shawn Cassidy!
You've had feelings for me?
That's the day you're gonna die? See-darnit, I've got shuffleboard that day.
What?
Maybe the pogo-stick likes it too?
What? Oh! I gotta tell you, I-I wasn't expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasn't expecting to like anyone right now, but she's really terrific.
My God Monica!!
Give daddy the Barbi! Ben, give, give me the Barbi. Okay, how 'bout, don't you want to play with the monster truck? No. Okay, oh, oh, how about a Dino-soilder?
I am now.
It uhh, it won't go back.
I played bad on purpose guys.
No, it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay?
Well isn't there something you can do to earn a little extra money? I mean, can't-can't you pick up, I don't know, an extra shift here?
Well, I said it loud.
Damn, this coffee's cold! Hey Rach, do you mind if I heat this up on your loins?
It's alright, it's no big deal.
What's the score?
All right! I want my key back!
Okay, but just the jacket. Double-oh and seven are not gettin' in there.
Yes, I do.
I'll take sports.
Hey!
Who cares? I repel women.
No-no-no, I-I wanna play.
Cool!
All right, I'll see you guys later.
I swear!
My God! These pants are burning up! Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now! What is she trying to kill me? It's like a volcano in here! Are you hot?
10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game.
She already lives in London.
Alright, I want my monkey.
I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay?
Hi. Sorry Im late. Wheres, wheres Carol?
Wow, it, it's neat learning about submarines.
The Armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! Okay Ben, it's time to light the Hanukkah candles!
That commercial always makes me so sad.
You all right?
Yeah? I was good at the stuff huh?
Pity food? Y'know what that's okay, all right, I don't need any of you to stay, okay nobody stays.
Yes, we did, everything's A-OK!
Oh, Emily that is, that is so great. It's gonna be so great! We're gonna be like-like-like two idiots in love!
Nope! Something else.
Hey does anyone have any gum?
He's taking her purse!
Hey.
Ok, and then you take the poopie diaper and you put it in the poopie diaper pail.
I wasn't talking to you.
It's a car Monica! Not a rocket ship!
Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?
Well sure. But I get married all the time so...
Yeah, save it for the cab, okay.
Come on! All the cool kids are eating 'em!
She wants me to move to London.
Monica, whatever you do, do not drop that ball!
So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date?
You got it.
Sexy?
Emily? Emily! Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Emily! It's Emily everyone! Shush-shush-shhst! Hi!
C'mon.
So how many more do you have tomorrow?
Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask?
Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.
If you wanna call that a reason.
Oh-oh really? Did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a Moist Maker?
Oh, where are you guys going?
I take it.
Wha, uhh, what?
Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay?
What?! I wh-, what's wrong?
You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.
All right, it's cool you can stay here. My parents won't mind.
Soon he'll be able to call you, that lady he knew who got fired.
Okay, it's not, it's not.
Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.
Hey, I might!
Nonono, thatthat's not what I was saying...
Good morning. Hey pal, look who I brought. It's your old friend Harry Elefante.
What should I wear, now I'm all nervous.
How hot do I look in this, huh?!
Oh, you-you're-you're one to talk.
So uh, any ideas for the bachelor party yet?
Hi, we have a little bathroom emergency.
Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?
Yeah, the phone was facing the other way. And that goes back up there.
Okay, okay. Uh, well uh, Rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings in his ear.
Hey! I just heard. What's up?
Oh, I uh, hope you don't mind, I kinda uh, jazzed it up a little. Check this out. We will, we will, call you back!
Hey!
Help! Help!! Help! Help!!
Okay. You can feel all the bones in your skull.
No, why?
Celia, don't worry! Don't scream! He's not going to hurt you! Soothing tones, Celia. Soothing tones! Marcel...
Of course.
What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?
So honey, this morning was fun, huh? Me hopping in on you in the shower there.
What are you doing here, Santa?
Come here, come here. Uh, ow! Emily, will you marry me?
Hi! Listen uhh, this cat belongs to a little girl. There are flyers all over the place.
How can you not believe in evolution?
No!
I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-
Phoebe that's not true.
Yeah. He could row like a viking.
How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.
Hey, you're not going to believe this. I made up a joke and sent it in to Playboy. They printed it!
Really? I've been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don't, don't you think we can work on this?
All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!
Yep! That's hilarious!
Her date tipped me ten dollars.
It's also a sign of friendship.
Yeah? Oh-oh, she'd be so excited!
No, we're not!!
Phoebe, 800 is toll free, 801 is-is Utah.
Oh you guys are not gonna believe what happened.
Yeah-uh-huh. Tomorrow night, Valentine's Day, the most romantic day of the year. Who knows what could happen? I might not be shutting my drapes to show her my slides, if you know what I mean.
Anyone else? Huh? Bring 'em on!
Hey, y'know what nickname never caught on? The Ross-A-Tron!
I'm in for fifty cents.
Okay, hold my crawler.
Ok, dinner's on.
I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
Okay, wish me luck.
That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now? You and I, we're interfacing.
Is uh, is Monica here?
Oh, hey y'know, they-they really overcharge you for that stuff. But who cares?! Because it's all on me! That is, one big drink!
Yeah?
Hey listen can you do me a big favor? The dean's office just called and said there was an urgent meeting. Can you watch Ben for like an hour?
Yes.
Oh, oh my God, is this the wrong day? I don't believe it, uh, well, hey, I guess if it works out we'll, we'll have something to tell the grandkids.
Alright, alright, now-now who should I say tricked me into doing it?
Yeah!
Of course I am. I just have to make a call.
So, uh, he's back.
Wow! Great! Wait, dad who-who's cigarettes are these?
Pheebs, what about you?
Yeah that-that, doesn't look right.
Pop it in.
There was no song. There was no song!
Hello!
Ah, we're out. I sold them all.
Phoebe.
Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.
Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?
Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?
This is-you-
I cannot sleep in a public place.
Hey-yeah. Hey Gunther, can I have a scone please? Wanna hear some good news? Someone I know is getting married! Yeah! And weddings are happy occasions! Oh, by-the-by it's my ex-wife Emily!
What a weird way to kick me when I'm down.
Wow, cool poster. Or should I say groovy poster? So, ahh, where were we?
Help! Help!
No, four minutes ago you had a half hour, we have to be out the door at twenty to eight.
No, no, we will. We just won't tell her she messed up.
Paolo, I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I say...
Easy. Easy. You have to go to the hospital. Okay?
Right. No biggie. Stay loose.
That's all right, we-we don't need you. In fact, hey I'm over it already.
Okay, do-do you have a good grip?
Hey.
What?
How come? Everybody else does.
I do-I do not have a boyfriend. There's a guy in one of my classes who-who has a crush on me.
Oh, mine! Mine! Mine! Okay, here goes. Prepare yourselves for some Class A flirting.
Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?
Rach, thanks but uh, I don't need you doing me any favors.
Hey, when did you and Susan meet Huey Lewis?
Oh my God! That's Rachel naked! I can't look at that! I am looking at this. Okay, vivid colors, expressive brush strokes-Unless she wants me to be looking at that. She knows I'm home. She knows I can see her. What kind of game is she playing? I think maybe someone's lonely tonight. Oh-ho, Dr. Geller! Stop it! You're being silly! Or, am I?
Yes I am.
No! You let go!
You're right. Yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings.
Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that.
You're not his godfather.
Look, you guys, you guys should go. No, I'm, you, you planned this all out, and I don't want to ruin it, so you guys should just go.
We're really gonna do this, huh?
About what?
Just go for it Chandler.
I'll help you. Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it. And plus, it'll give me something to do.
Come on. I got it.
Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad.
God, that was, that was amazing, that was incredible. You guys, you guys kicked butt.
Come on, come on. Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit. This is all your fault. This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know? My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you.
Joey, you look nothing like Ben.
Uh.... bean! Bean!
I can.
What?
All right Emily, as much as I love you, I'm sorry, I can't move to London without Ben.
Phoebe!
Dude, we got to talk.
Jen, I know this may sound a little... But uh, would you maybe wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime, or...
Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?
No! No we don't!
Yes, that's what I was going to ask, thank you.
I think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that Ben would get the part.
I guess so.
What happened?
Toilet paper?
No kidding?
You talked to her?
I don't know, something girlie.
Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course!
That's not bad.
...run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with...
Emily? Emily? I'm coming in.
I gotta go make a fake Ben.
MY SANDWICH?!!!
Yeah, it was, but...I get home, ok, and I see Julie's saline solution on my night table. And I'm thinking to myself, oh my god, what the hell am I doing? I mean, here I am, I am with Julie, this incredible, great woman, who I care about and who cares about me, and I'm like, what, am I just gonna throw all that away?
Oh.
Yeah, and-and thank you for Emily.
No, no, no. Technically the... sex is not... being had, but that's... see, that's not the point. See, um, the point is that... Rachel and I should be, er, together. You know, and if you get in the.... um...
Because there are naked ladies there.
Bye.
You okay?
What happened?!!
So really, what'd ya have?
I don't know what to say, I'm sorry. Though, you're not supposed to take these. It's like a million years old, we, we actually, we had people looking for that.
Look, don't worry about me. Okay? I'll just stay real energetic and stay away from the ball. I'll uh, I'll be that guy right out of the circle.
One more day, seriously/
Ok fine.
Well that's different! Okay? Because he, he was actually in love with me!
Ohh! Thank you.
Multiple orgasms!
So what's it shaped like?
Fine! It's your life! I just don't want to see you guys break up! Which you will do if you move in together, but that's what you want, there's nothing I can do. DON'T DO IT!!!!!
That's a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?
Hi!
Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part. Helloo!
Mon?
Hey.
Yeah.
Is that Mark?
Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?
What?
How could you have told her?
Okay, okay. If that is what it takes to show you how much you mean to me, and how much I want you there. Then that's what I'll do.
We had such a great time! She's-she's incredible! I thought the-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn't. It wasn't at all. Elizabeth is very mature for her age. A concept lost on some people!
I did.
Hey uh, well, today's my first lecture and I kinda wanted to try it out on you guys, do you, do you mind?
Umm, say you're gonna be starving after all this moving. What do you say I take you to dinner tonight?
What?
Hey Pheebs, has Gary ever been shot at for real?
Oh but I-I-I haven't paid you yet!
She said, "Thank you." I said, "I love you." And she said, "Thank you."
It wasn't so much a party as...a gathering of people, with food, and music, and, and the band.
Well? Isn't that amazing?
Thank you.
Burt!
What?
Woah, ho-ho, whad'ya got there, a weapon?
Hi Frannie, congratulations.
Yeah-yeah you guys. Get out of here!
It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again.
Oh, sure. Whoa-whoa, what's this? The delivery charge is almost as much as the couch!
Y'know what? Actually I'm kinda glad they're leaving 'cause uh, I need to talk to you about something.
Okay.
Dad, dad, dad, I'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing. Did you uh, ever get this sort of... panicky, "Oh my god I'm gonna be a father" kind of a thing?
Oh, tell me, tell me, is everything, uhh....?
You look pretty tonight.
And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did, and peed all over the crossword.
Really?! We are?
This is not good for my rage.
You'll see. Okay. Oh, what's-what's her name?
Oh. Oh-oh.
You see what men do! Don't tell me men are not nice! This is men!!
When I got married you slept with my sister.
Mon, Mon, are you OK?
Easy.
You got it.
Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, "Why not?!"
What? Sophie, does she have ten minutes?
But, you, you don't want to seem too pushy.
Okay, Elizabeth Hurely....
No, sorry I don't. Tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life? What if it doesn't come out right Phoebe? Then it's like, I don't know, havin' a bad hair cut all the time. Why's everyone staring at me?
Excellent, that was excellent.
Okay, sure.
Wh-Hey-Whoa-whoa, where, where you going?!
Oh hey, that was a good one, huh? Help! Help!
Thanks for being born.
Could you be less enthused?
No I don't want to play video games, Joey!
Na-huh.
Yeah. Tell ya what, let's not invite any of the anthropologists, only the dinosaur dudes!
I hate Chandler, the bastard ruined my life.
Yeah!
'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your home?
Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella. Don't, don't just dismiss this so fast. I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...
The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?
Hey, y'know what? This is your fault! You're the one that didn't move his-his appointment.
Sorry! Sorry! Oh, there! Hey Gary, who am I? Phone home!
I got it.
Happy New Year, Pheebs!
No, not this time. So... what'd you have?
It's old, it's definitely old. Didn't you hear the, the double beep?
Wow! Yeah!
Which one was that?
Okay. Wow, it's-it's 5:30 in the morning. So, I'd better get cracking on this baby.
So, I just finished this fascinating book. By the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and-and-and live forever as a machine.
Oh umm, there's also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina. What is that?
I will be! Listen, I don't want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?
Everybody smile.
That's cool.
I gave him an extremely professional massage!
Yeah. You can help me get my furniture back from Gunther.
Well, I guess we could tape Entertainment Tonight.
Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.
Ooh. What is the name of Chandler's father's Las Vegas all-male burlesque?
We were on a break!!! Okay!! We were, we were..., yeah. Where are you? I'll find you.
Hey!
No! The guy is mean. I mean really mean. I think you should stay away from him.
Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of M*A*S*H and half the hostages coming home?
Hey!
I think, sub-consciously...
Oh, great. Great. There was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it.
But-but, if you don't love this, we'll do it in any other place at any other time. Really, it's fine, whatever you want.
Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?
Hey, you guys! Guess what?
You don't have a valid driver's license-Okay that is it! Pull over right now!
I am sorry, Chandler.
My uncle Marcel.
He is my girlfriend's father, okay? It's-it's, it's weird!
Why are they here?
What? That's impossible.
About yesterday, I was really wrong. I am sorry.
Emily.
Hey!
Gimme the bottle. Gimme the towel.
I do. I do. I do.
Thanks.
All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and dammit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes .
Thanks!
I know.
Excuse me, I'm seizing. Mr. Treeger, here's another 50, happy Hanukkah. Will uh, will this help with the knob getting?
Way to go guys. Y'know, you-you were really good at the stuff too.
What?!
Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?
Look I-I don't know what's going on with you and your husband and what is hopefully an adult dog walker, look can I just say not all men are like that.
Does it always, uh--?
Pffhah.
My fault?! You threatened the judge!
Oh, oh that's right, I forgot about your ability to fuse metal.
Yeah!
Oh.
Ohh! Ohh! In college, Chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm!
Hi! What's ah, what's Mark doing answering your phone?
Yeah, not since I got too strong for you.
Can I see you for a second?
Right? And this! She-she could've won this!
Oh sweetie, when do you think you're going to get off tonight?
That-that-that's all right, no honey, you take your time sweetie. I'll be right out here. She's just fixing her makeup.
Look, they must be stopped!
Really?
Okay, you are totally making this up.
Wow, uh, Joey that's-that's great. Thanks man.
Okay Pheebs, I know how we're going to figure this out. Okay, clear your mind and answer the first thing that comes into your head. Okay?
Uh, hold, let me see, I don't know. So what're you gonna do. . .
Oh thanks!
But...
No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.
Oh Mon, I laughed so hard...
Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.
I'm gonna have to give him up.
Wow! What a pleasure.
Pheebs come on! I mean, consider the source! Of course her ex-husband's gonna say that stuff. Now, if you'll excuse me...
You're kid's name is Raymond!
Y'know what? I-I-I... I-I have had enough of this! Y'know, I-I-I care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing but respect! So if-if you've got a problem with me, frankly...
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
You, you know I, I don't, have a- have a problem with that.
So this is your office?
So I'm a pimp huh? It's okay! Look, I know that sometimes I can be a pain in the ass, but you just have to talk to me. Tell me if something is bothering you. Okay? And for my part I will do everything I can to keep my annoying habits just .
Hiii.
Uh-huh.
Uh okay, well there's-there's wine in the kitchen.
Okay! All clear!
Bye.
Ooooohhhh.
Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that may make you want to stay married. We register, and you get to keep all the presents!
Princess Leia, was wearing this, um, gold bikini thing. It was pretty cool.
Oh no-no, after you. Oh my God!
Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!
I'll be right there. Hello! Hello! Hey. Uhh, Emily, this is Carol and Susan.
Look at that, they won't even turn their heads.
You wanna buy a car?
Technically, huh, no.
Oh here, I think this is us. Yeah.
Oh, you like it? You wanna know where I got it?
Get out!
Hi.
You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?
What?! You totally get embarrassed!
Oh, hi Chloe.
Oh, I thought you guys had just been on like four dates, I didn't realise that had become anything, yet.
Thank you.
Well, there you go.
Ok.
So, he's just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesn't want anything in exchange for helping him?
Yes, it was horrible. She cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me. Anyway, I did the right thing.
I'm getting married, to..day!!
All right.
Phoebe, why'd you do it?
Uh, excuse me, uh, where can we find the monkey?
I-I-I don't care if I said some other girl's name you prissy, old twit!
I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we can't date. It's against the rules. It's forbidden.
Yowzah!!!
Look at it this way: you dumped her. Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable... Tell me why you did this again?
As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, until death parts us. Really, I do. Emily.
Okay! Okay! Ooh-hey-hey-hey! Okay! Okay! Okay! I'll-I'll tell her tonight I can't see her anymore.
Look, just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you shouldn't have any fun! Okay? And besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna look at you. Okay? This is Vegas! Hello! There are tons of other freaks here! There are tons...of...freaks here. No other. No. Come on! No one will notice, I swear!
What's the part, Anti-man?
It's Gandolf, and he's not coming.
No no, you're uh, you're my lobster. See um, lobsters, uhh, in the tank when, when they're old, uhh, they get with, uhh, they walk around holding the claws. In the tank, ya know, with, with the holding and. . . Uhh, Phoebs you wanna help me out with the, the whole lobster thing?
Hiiii-Ya!! I'm serious! You're not walking out on my sister!
Dude.
You like it?
Either that or my mouth is getting smaller.
Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?
I'm starving!
Yeah, that's okay, I mean if you guys all have to go away for the first weekend I'm alone by myself, y'know then I totally, totally understand.
Oh-oh really?
We're not alone.
Um, just some presents.
I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
Right! So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery! What he believed to be igneous, was in fact sedimentary. Imagine his consternation when- Oh bloody hell.
Oh, it's not so bad. Monica's gonna make potpourri! I think I'm gonna go wander out in the rain for a while.
What's going on?
No, no he's not.
Hey.
OK, got the music, got the dinner. Oh and check it out, I made Marcel's favorite dish, banannacake.
I know.
Hey.
Tonight.
I feel great. I feel- great, I fleel great.
Hello.
Come on, Pheebs lay off him.
Well I guess you can start by drivin a cab on Another World.
What's wrong with people having sex?
Yeah. So um, I-I heard about this ah, Mark guy that ah, Rachel met today.
Uh, Eddie something. He just met him.
No, no, it's okay. Really. They're plenty of people who just see their sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey at Burger King. So is, is that better?
Neil Sedaka wears them.
Won't you dance around with me.
Well, apparently not, and I can't just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the silliness!
Yeah! Se vice?
You're welcome, Ben. Merry Christmas, ooh, and Happy Hanukkah!
Hey, y'know if you want to pick up some extra cash? Some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing.
It's no surprise that your winning, 'cause you got to pick first, so you got the better team.
Wow, Monica's letting other people help decorate her tree! Did someone get her drunk again or?
It was just a kiss.
Well, that's cool. So did...
Hi.
Listen, I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom...
Okay, I've got three of my five.
When you put a 'D' at the end of 'Fine' you're not fine.
Uhh, it was okay. Yeah, it was fun.
Cheers!
'Cause, I'm a stupid, stupid man.
It could happen.
Oh yeah! Then how come you didn't get the Geller Cup?
Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay.
Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isn't about the room, this is about what the room...represents! And unfortunately, this room could destroy you!!
I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.
Hi Gunther.
Two! I've been engaged twice!
What? What? What?! You guys knew? You all knew and you didn't tell me?!!
Oh, I hate this story.
How did he do this?
All right, that's it! Come-you-no! You are in big trouble young man!
Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing.
Well you need 60% to pass...
Okay, I did not abandon Rachel! Okay? Emily showed up at the airport! I had to go after her! I mean, I-I did what I had to do! She's my wife! Rachel is my wife! Y'know-Emily! Emily, is my wife! Man, what is that?
Monica couldn't tell time 'til she was 13!
Rach. OK, forget, forget the lobsters OK. We're, let's talk, what about us?
Okay, okay, I'll go first.
Every week, the TV Guide comes to Chandler and Joey's apartment. What name appears on the address label?
Aqui est.
Well, yeah. I can't-I can't stay here all night, and if I go in there she's-she's gonna wanna... do stuff.
Hi.
Mon, look who I ran into!
It is off.
I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!
The physical act of love.
That's okay, I'm not so crazy about myself right now either.
Yeah!
One-Mississippi, two-Mississippi, switch! Switch! Switch!!
Are you sure?
No. No.
And here's little Ben nodding off...
Oh well. It probably would've been the most constructive solution.
No!
Hey Pheebs, how's it going?
A little? Your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue. Oh look at that! The ornamental bird cage! Large!
Well, start looking.
Yeah!!
This is unbelievable.
Well, Rachel's having drinks with him tonight.
No! Hey! Hey! We can't!
Oh, I hope they're not ruined.
So uh, where's Monica?
Why? Did you write it?
Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?
Done!
No. Now maybe.
I like this song.
Come on, you-you can't tell me you actually believe that-that there's a woman inside that cat!
Pheebs, if you don't tell him, soon he's gonna be married, and then you're gonna hate yourself.
No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second. That's my friend's machine.
There never was a library. I mean there are libraries, its just that I ah, I never worked at one.
Okay, okay, what's going on?
We're sorry.
I was having a little chat with ah, Bonnie, and ah, guess what, she-she happened to bring up y'know, who was behind the um, whole head shaving idea, and now, who was it? Oh, that's right, that's right, it was you!
I just wanna thank you for being there for me today. And I'm sorry I,I almost broke your hand.
...and it was Ernst Muhlbrat who first hypothesized that the Velociraptor would expand it's collar and emit a high pitched noise to frighten it's predator. Yes Mr. Lewis?
All right, I just wanted to check.
What're you doing?
I wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun.
I can't believe that didn't work!
Hi.
Still thinking about it huh?
Oooooh.
Come on up. I'm gonna get the rest of his stuff together.
I think it's insane.
She's fine. She doesn't know you're gone. And she doesn't have to know, okay? Now come on, we're going home.
Rach?
It's a great class.
Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away.
Oh, well, when you don't have the cards, you don't have the cards, you know. But, uh... look how happy she is.
That guy Lipson?
She doesn't know she was fired yet, does she?

Well, uh.
I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to...
Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not, quite..
Oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, I was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all, we all are using it.
Yeah, I know. I mean, no, you're right. Yeah I guess I'll let it go. But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.
Hey, Pheebs.
This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.
What's up?
C'mon, what, you never think about our future?
Oh-oh, hitting me where it hurts, my ski skills.
Cool! Dad! My report cards! Hey, check this out dad, Math, A. Science, A. History, A. Gym... Oooh, my rock polisher!
So uh, wha-uh, what do you do?
That's okay.
Yeah, see Mon, listen, listen. When Carol and I broke up, I went through the same thing. And you know what I did?
Hmm.
We were all pretty shaken up about it.
Ohh, I-I see lotion, I have lotion! Will that work?
You know what, you guys, we don't have to watch this.
No, it's a concept!
Why?
Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her friend...Phyllis...take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed.
The way he makes me feel about myself.
Actually, nectarines, but basically...
And is a hum, kinda like a scruddle?
So, I just picked up a message from Emily, she and Susan are going to a poetry reading together!
Oh, ah, you don't need that.
Okay. Well, apparently Chandler's angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago.
Oh yeah! So ah, kinda pretty, pretty good. He sounds like a nice, good guy.
Yeah, it's, it's, it's cute. Why, why, why does he have it, again?
I would!
What?
I'm sorry Rach, it was, it was really close.
I, I just never think of money as an issue.
Were you the ones called the cops?!
So they ah, they all took off, it was pretty hard watching them go, y'know?
Yes, yes, that's right...
Yes, you can, very much.
Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!
Huh.
Gosh, we talked about that but your brother has so many science trophies and plaques and merit badges, well we didn't want to disturb them.
Baking it didn't help, huh?
Hey, anyone hear from Phoebe yet?
Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.
I'm really glad we came. You're so pretty. I love you.
I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist!
All right. A room. A man enters, he looks suspicious. That's it? Joey, you're supposed to have five pages done by now! Including an exciting incident! And what is, and what is all this?! The official rulebook of Fireball.
Laugh it up, but the joke's on you. Because we don't need to get divorced, okay? We we're just gonna get an annulment.
Okay.
This is Ross?
Oh my God, the wedding book?! I haven't seen that since the forth grade!
My marriage is over.
Gunther. Hey-hey! Why don't we put them on? Y'know get a picture of Batman and James Bond together.
Hey.
I'm sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right about her. Y'know, she did try to use sex as a weapon! Yeah, I hurt my back a little.
Just a high pitched intimidating noise.
Really?
Uh-huh.
Sure.
It's right there!
I went to Egypt with my dad.
And so do I.
It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? Yes it will. Or we can leave it on for now, that's fine.
Hey.
You didn't tell her?! Okay, fine! Pheebs?
Thanks? But I have plans; Elizabeth and I are going out of town.
What code?
Ok, ok, number one: The way you cry at game shows. Number two: how much you love your friends. Number three: the way you play with your hair when you're nervous. Number four: how brave you are for starting your life over. Number five: how great you are with Ben.
It's okay man, be strong.
No! The reason I'm asking is that... I sorta had one last night.
Look, I know you don't want to hear this right now but, we've seen him in his new place, alright. And he's happy, he's, he's decorated.
Yeah?
She's your cousin. She's your cousin! If she knew what was going on in your head she'd think you were sick! Or would she? Let's back up a second. She was the one who suggested opening a bottle of wine. She was the one who turned down the lights. She was the one that wanted to rent Logan's Run, the sexiest movie ever. Oh, I know that look. Forget it. I want it. She wants it. I'm going in.
MY SANDWICH?!!!
So Rach, maybe you and I could fly out together Saturday.
Okay, it's not, it's not.
Dear Lord!!
I don't know.
No! No! It's wrong! It's-it's-it's naughty. It's taboo.
Yeah. There's no breaking them up, is there?
What are you doing?
Cat!
How was I supposed to know we'd end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister?
Thing, yes. Thing.
Well then we'll-we'll see you the day after tomorrow. Mom?! Dad?! What-what...what you guys doing here?!
So, I got us some reservations for Sunday night, okay? How about, Ernie's at 9 o'clock?
Chandler-
Yeah, what're you guys doin' here, aren't you supposed to be Christmas shopping?
Well umm, I've been doing a lot more of my kara-tay.
So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow?
Umm... Wow! That's-that's some pricey nut!
Yay!!
Well pal, you didn't give me much of a choice.
We'll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth-me.
Yeah, I guess we don't have a choice. Help us! Please help us! We're stuck up on the roof and we can't get down!!!
Ohh.
Ross, uh and uh, I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight. And, uh, for the record she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis. What are you doing I'm serious. Uh, the reason she walked out on, on Barry is simply that she didn't love him, which incidentally worked out pretty well for me Cheers.
You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.
No.
Chloe? Hi..
OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah...
So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones.
Okay, there was some staring and pointing.
No! No!
No.
What-why?
What?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown didn't count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose breaking.
You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.
Shut-out!!
Umm, oh, hey, I don't know. How about a big one?
A lesson in the importance of unagi.
This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner.
Hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, we'd still hang out?
Believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long.
So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?
No-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island.
Is everything okay?
Oh my god. You are pure evil.
Dude, we were good!
You guys, you know what, you know what, it doesn't matter, because you both have to go get dressed before the big vain in my head pops. So..
Oh well, since I have that whole history with Rachel, I guess Phoebe.
Well, whatever it is I'm-I'm very, very sorry. Okay?
Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all?
Rach? Hi!
Oh, wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight.
Yeah.
Wh-wh-what line? The line that prompted a student in my last class of the day to say uh, "Dude, don't you ever was your face?"
No! I balanced my checkbook.
Plus tip, divided by six. Ok, everyone owes 28 bucks.
Of course! It all adds up! I mean you you're obsessed with her. It's always, "Ross, what are you gonna do about Rachel?" "Ross, why-why are you moving in with Rachel?" "When are you gonna confess your secret marriage to Rachel?" You want her!
Y'know, hey! You're the one who ended it, remember?
Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?
Okay, so, do you make the pizzas in one of those uh, wood-burning ovens?
What, woah, woah, $3500 at porcelain safari?
Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now if it's possible I think I love you even more. So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm not gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away.
Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche I'll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.
Yes. Yes. Just here and there .
Hello? Hi.
Hi Jill!
Oh yeah, she's-she's amazing. And-and she's so much fun. And! Y'know what? When I'm with her, I'm fun! I even signed up for helicopter classes. She's leaving in two days, I don't have to do it.
Oh.
I can't belive you two had sex in her dream.
Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?
And thank you, for that.
People need juice!
Save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. The clock is ticking. We have no time, and we are losing, we are losing to girls.
I was just leaving.
Ok, Pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?
Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.
Yeah!
Yes! That's where we realized we were both super cool people!
Monica and Chandler are living together!
I was kinda, supposed to be on TV tonight for The Discovery Channel.
Who's Chip?
That is so made up!
Oh, I've got to go pick up Ben, we've got a play date this afternoon.
It's breast milk.
My God!
Oh, why don't you make her one of your little jokes.
Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.
Ross, wants a pajmena?
Yeah! Oh yeah, you'll be fine! It-it'll be uh, just like bungy jumping. Y'know? But instead of bouncing back up you-you won't.
Really?
Thanks!
Well, ya know, someone should have called me.
...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him.
Anyway. That's when our Mom said we were not to play football ever again.
Oh really, really great! Yeah! A-actually she's right down the street, umm, do-do you know what? You should stop bye and say hi.
And what is second prize?
Huh. Y'know what's not one of a kind? A twin!
Yeah, okay, Scott!
That's funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel!
He-he was with me umm, we're playing a little game, y'know? Hide and seek.
No-no-no! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.
You are? Me, too!
Wait hold on Tony, hold on. Hello. Hi, yeah no, she's right here. Um hold on. Hi Tony, can I call you back? That's uh, that's my sister's boyfriend.
.....Hi.
Monica, Monica, your guest are turning into jerky, OK.
I've got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women, never thought I would be divorcing you.
Awwww!!!
"Hey Ross, it's you!" Oh yeah, no that's-that's an old message, nobody needs to hear that.
I don't know, I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out.
Oh man.
All right so, Chandler, from now on, don't give your boss a chance to get you. Y'know just ah, don't turn your back to him.
Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y'know? She lives so close. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that was-if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasn't kidding, she's not fun, she's stupid, and kind of a racist.
Noo, nnnnn. What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?
Thanks. OK.
You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?
I know! Don't switch hands, okay?
Okay, now just remember everything I taught you and you'll be fine. Okay? Here we go. Ready...Set...
You have 30 seconds. And the lightning round begins-stop it -now. What was Monica's nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
Yeah?
Rachel!! Monica!!
Hey. So I uh, I didn't get that apartment. Some problem with my application.
Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?
So what, we just sit?
Really. It's always been you, Rach.
Yeah.
Yeah! Good for you Joe!
Petty...
Sure! Hey, I just found out, I get Ben for the holidays this year.
Ohhh! Kids!
Fine.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Well, I'm gonna lie to you Joey, it's a possibility.
I whitened them.
Awwwahuh, no, no, no!!
Noo.
No! No, I won't! I'll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now. The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh, Murderer Guy, and-and, Geologists.
What's going on?
Yay! And that takes what? Just six or seven minutes.
Not at all! I love this guy. Hey, I was so psyched to hear you're back with my sister!
No.
No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok? Where does that leave me?
Breathe! Breathe! Breathe throw the pain.
No, why?
Yeah!
What?! Look, we're trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?
Well, now I do!!
And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend. And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.
Oh, great! Listen, oh I had to get you a whole new battery. I got you the best one I could, 'cause that's not where you want to skimp.
My hands?
Dad, she won't want to go with me.
Play it.
Just-just so you know I was a freshman and she was a senior. So it wasn't as bad as-as...
Yeah, take your time.
Yes, it's a deadly but beautiful sport.
??? Thro up a thro thro--a thro thro!
You're good. These are not.
I'd like that.
Nono, she's gone.
Wow! Happy Monica's night!
Emily's cousin kicked me out!
You're welcome for a delicious dinner.
What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again?
She's going in. Wait! He's going in! He's going in!! The door's closed! I, I can't see anything but the door closed!!
Alright, alright, here's the chance. Monica give him cash, Rachel give him your earrings. Something, now, anything.
How are you ever going to sell this place?
What?
Good for you.
For your information, it's a card sharp, not a card shark.
Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?
Stupid balls are in the way.
We're just tryin' to do a nice thing here.
So the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?
Is that Mark?
Umm...
Okay.
Yeah, yeah, just a tough day at work. A stegosaurus fell over and trapped a kid. Whoa, whoa, I know this jacket, this is, th--Fun Bobby's jacket! Where is he, what. He, he's here, isn't he?
Oh!
I tell you, I've never seen him this happy.
Yeah? How'd it go?
Oh, hello.
I'm good.
It was a hug!
I Ross...
Oh, yeah, why not?
Yeah.
No! No! Of course it didn't mean anything! I mean, uh well, I can understand why Emily would think it meant something, y'know, because-because it was you...
Yes, you can, very much.
Uh, everyone, this is Chandler! My roommate and lead singer of our band!
Too easy? Too...The process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single-celled organisms, too easy?
It's nothing, I just gave her a hug.
Yeah? What about ah, that bike messenger you hit?
That was you?
Hey!
Oww!! Son of a...!! Ow! Come on!
Not at the concert.
Alright you kids, bye now.
Althea is correct.
Yeah, I'm-I'm sure. Yeah, get out of here before I change my mind.
ALL RIGHT!! Phoebe now come on! Will you please tell me what it is I did that mad you so mad at me!
This is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television.
What?! Hello! We didn't get married.
Pheebs, come on, you didn't kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist. It's, it's, it's just ah, a coincidence.
I do.
Yeah, well...nah.
Nah.
Hey.
Hey umm, was-was Monica here?
Aw, Mom...
Yeah! Right!
Can you please not do that feet first? You know where his injury is! Severed toe, you just said it!
I got itI'm getting it!
Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "hey, you're not Bob."
I'm not a nice guy.
M-maybe I should hang and you can climb down me.
Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place.
No, no it's, um, it's not you, um, it's um, it's
Kristen Lang.
Well sorry, that's what I do on dates.
Peach pit.
Oh my God! Thank you! Thank you so much!
What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?
Hey now! That was an accident, okay.
Hey-hey, what are those?
Here you go.
Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-what's wrong with Monica and Chandler?
What are you doing? Are you trying to hurt me? Or something?
So you wanna watch uh, Entertainment Tonight?
Hey, is Chandler here?
My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich. I can't believe someone ate it!
Today's the day Carol and I first.. consummated our physical relationship. Sex. ..You know what, I-I'd better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.
Look, check this out. Is it a coffee table, is it a panther? There's no need to decide.
Here's your girlfriend's button.
It's still looks pretty far!
I don't know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes.
One.
No, no, Pheebs, we can't, ok, because--
Like uh y'know like this! This! She-she could've made this!
Okay, there's this guy, Warren, from the museum and he's going on a dig for like two years and he's got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh, you interested?
They put that in.
Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be... flung by now?
Great! Great! You're making the bike very happy.
Oh! Listen umm, I, I just stopped by to see if you wanted to see this play tonight. Umm, it's supposed to be excellent. The director is the same...
One night, just-just sex. No strings attached?
Ohh, what's wrong?!
I don't want to do that.
Hey guys.
Save it.
Uh-hmm.
How about you?
Yeah. Hey, remember the time I jammed that pencil into your hand?
Oh, hey Aunt Millie.
Uhh, Pheebs' Grandmother just died.
Oh y'know what, girls don't like it when I start talking about science.
Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say...
What, it's not your fault.
Do you wanna start telling secrets?
Judy, Judy, relax, this is our little harmonica we're talking about. We taught her well. Ten percent of your paycheck, where does it go?
Not on you! On the stripper!
No, I-I-I'm serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y'know you break up!
Hey!
Right. So is it gonna be like 'I'm abandoning you while your upset.'
You think?
Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.
Okay. So well I'll umm, I'll have her home by midnight.
Oh no! It could be better, but it's gonna be okay, right?
Umm, Jo's a girl, it's short for Josephine.
Look Carol umm, I was, I was thinking maybe uh, maybe we can spice things up a little.
Okay, umm I want you to know that I have never done anything like this before. I mean, I mean I've been in um, relationships in general, uh but I have never done it with a student-I mean I not-not it! I mean, I mean I don't-We haven't done it. Uh, I mean, I mean, we've-we've-we've done stuff. Okay, okay, a joke, a joke-lighten the mood. Umm, two guys go into a bar. One of them is Irish.
Whoa-whoa-whoa!
I don't know.
Eh? We'll show him!
Oh, Judy. Oh, Judy.
Then what am I supposed to do?
He said he liked that!! Oh you're right, you're right. I'm sorry.
Ok, we were sitting over there playing on the floor and he grabs the table and he pulls himself up. He pulled himself up. Standing man. I'm sorry you guys missed it but I did tape it so it you guys want to see it.
Oh, just planning my bachelor party with my best man.
All right, there you go!
Okay! Okay! Okay!
No, that, that was, I mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. Is this over yet Rach?
Oh yeah? I guess we'll just see!
Is this about Mark?
I'm having a baby in here! Ok, everyone stand back. Ow.
I know. I know.
Hey, Fun Bobby!
Yeah.
Ah, somebody's at the door on the ceiling.
Monica and I have a grandmother who died, you both went to her funeral, name that grandmother!
Yes that's right.
Okay.
Well I'm sorry but you were! Okay? And besides if anyone should be hitting on her it's the guy who's single, the guy that who-who-who can do something about it.
I love you.
Yes, and the dimmer switch.
You're good.
What?!
KARL!
Hey!
No! For all I know, she's trying to find me but couldn't because I kept moving around. No, from now on, I'm staying in one place. Right here.
We've got presents!
Oh my God! You actually exchanged it!
Yeah, okay.
You, you go long.
Sure! Ooh-ooh, what about this?
Hey!
Pheebs? What, why are you whispering?
Ok.
Ooh, I wanna switch to Rachel too!
You mean that?
Well, you know, I'd feel a whole lot better if you got dressed now.
Let me see! Show them!
Sure! Oh, and Joey's got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.
Hey.
Really?
Hi! What are you, what are you doing here?
She said what?
Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says 'Jack Geller, so predictable'. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say 'Buried at sea! Huh!'.
Hey.
What? Are you going back to work?
So Joey umm, you look familiar. Are uh, are you on TV or something?
Really? Its not just frowned upon?
Oh my God! Of course, of course. Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment? Umm, do you know each other's hometowns? Why don't you... Wh-what's going on?
I think he can be.
Why is it inside out?!
Why?
Gas? Wow! Intense.
Emily, there is nothing between Rachel and me. Okay? I love you.
Bye Ben.
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh..........
I tell you one thing, I wouldn't mind having a piece of this sun-dried tomato business. Five years ago, if somebody had said to me, here's a tomato that looks like a prune, I'd say "get out of my office!"
Spring vacation.
Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia?
Ah-ha, nowhere to run!
What?
What?
Yeah.
What?!
That's no problem.
I can do that.
You chipped in?!
You remember Janice, right?
Yeah, like I could lose it.
Yeah, how does Jason look in a v-neck?
And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!
I am so over Janine. I mean, yeah, at first I thought she was hot, but now she's like OLD NEWS!
Hi! What are you, what are you doing here?
Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L.A. so I figured I'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel.
Dr. Green. How are you?
Look, I'm sorry but you-you-you better go Pheebs.
I suppose.
Mm-Hmm.
Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.
Julie, can you hold this for a second, thanks.
Fine.
Well, hello, Mrs. Ross!
So you were right?
Well for starters, you may want to light it and lose the spatula.
Chloe, Chloe how's it coming?!!
But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope?
Hey!
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area.
Help!
No, please, please, um, it's for a poor little girl who wants to go to Spacecamp more than anything in the world.
Y'know, she tried to undress me too.
What?
I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!
Okay.
I mean-no, it's just 'cause, it's just 'cause you and I were like a nightmare. No, but there was some good times.
Ben! I mean, Ben! Ben!
Well we-we don't know for sure. But in my head it-it sounded something like this. Of course, this is just conjecture. Okay, that's uh, that's all for today. Uh Mr. Morse, can I see you for a moment?
Nothing I do means anything, really.
Yeah in fact, I'm gonna go call her right now. And I'll make sure to tell her my friend Chandler says...
It doesn't matter! It's my principles! We're talking about my principles!
Listen, I'm- I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, it's just I...
Just please stop!
Thank you. So did you ah, did you tell Mark Something about me?
Take thee, Emily. Like there'd be anybody else.
Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend.
Excuse me sir, you've got a little something right here.
Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you?
Hi. Uh, I have been in the bathroom. Stay clear of the salmon mousse.
All the time?
Maybe he's just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it?
What the hell are you doing?
Well, they painted over the word 'Sapien' for one thing, then they rearranged the figures, let's just leave it at that.
Hey, it's my list.
Yeah.
Can we please focus here, a naked man's life hangs in the balance!
Dr. Franzblau, hi.
Wait! No! Ben, come here! I am not kidding!
All right, see you later.
Ahh. Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?
Pheebs, I have studied evolution my entire adult life. Ok, I can tell you, we have collected fossils from all over the world that actually show the evolution of different species, ok? You can literally see them evolving through time.
Ah well, can't blame a guy for trying!
Helen Geller? I don't think so.
Well, see? So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your mom, uh? Huh? But.. we don't have to go down that road.
All right, you know that one was coming, but that doesn't mean you have unagi.
A date.
Aww. Thank you, Aunt Phoebe.
Yeah!
Hey! How'd the ah, basketball go?
200 dollars.
Hi .
Oh, fire! There, there's a fire! Fire!!
Look, can, can you do something for me?
Okay, where in the hell did you get that?!
Well, eww. What? Is it a pimple?
Ewwww!!
Oh, whatever.
You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?
That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Who did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'.
OK. Oh, oh, oh.
Hey!
Challenge extended.
Ohhhh...
Is this about Mark?
Huh.
Ohh.
You're right, thanks for keeping me honest dad.
Why?
Oh, yeah, well y'know Chandler printed it up on his computer.
And he's, he's a total stranger?
You think?
Oh no. Don't, don't, don't start packing. Come on!
That may be the most depressing thing I've heard in my life. I should probably get these to my lawyer's office.
What thing?
You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
So you do know a little English.
Excellent!
So umm, any word from Susan?
Yeah!!
Wow.
Y'know what, y'know what, I'm-I'm not the one that wanted that, that break, okay. You're the one that bailed on us. You're the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough!
Huh, what's fish hooking... Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?
Look uh, if we're gonna do this...
Uh, sweetie we've gotta go.
People are doing it in front of my book!
Yes, we have something we have to get to.
We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!
I'll do it. Hey, whatever you need me to do, I'm your man. Whoa-oh-whoa! Are you, are you okay?
I think Chandler's gone.
Uh, oh-oh, no you didn't. I did.
Yep.
Hey, Joey. Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?
Oh God.
Y'know I have dinner plans!!
And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?
Huh.
Good evening officer.
So how'd it go?
Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.
You know the song! Sing along!
You're welcome.
Cool!
Thank you!
Why should Ben step aside? It was his audition in the first place! You-you just tagged along! You're like the uh, tag-a-long dad.
Yeah!
Well you shouldn't be. Believe me I wouldn't want to be the guy who's up against you. I mean that doofus is going to lose!
Sorry.
Oh man! I want that place so much!! I was so sure that was gonna work! There's twelve bucks I'll never see again!
I just, I don't understand, I mean, how-how can she do this? Y'know, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she'd actually show up?
Nope.
Hey lady! I don't care how much you want it! Okay?! I am not gonna to have sex with you in the bathroom!
Okay. Sure.
Doing great! Yes-yes-yes! Take control! Yes!
I've gotta go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!
Thank you.
It's called the Bapstein-King comet, okay? Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer!
Ohh.
Hey, do uh, do you have a minute?
What happened?
Kinda like my uncle Ed, covered in Jell-o.
Oh my God!
Joey! This is like the last commercial. You've got like ten minutes left!
You ate my sandwich?
: OK, I am calling your seventeen. What do you got?
Thank God.
Here, go nuts.
Hey.
Hi.
Come on Pheebs, it's not that bad! Y'know most people would be excited if they didn't have to work for a couple of weeks.
No problem, ok, mmmwa oh, mmmwa Susan...
I, I don't know, it's got all this stuff about wind and trees and there's some kind of sacred pool in it. I mean, I don't really get it but she's, she's pretty upset about it.
Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family?
Okay, hey, that's okay with me. Two down and I have exactly twelve minutes.... Wha, my watch stopped. My watch. Okay, see, the, the dinosaur tail isn't going around any more. What time is it? It's 7:33, I have seven minutes. I have seven minutes!!
Oh my God! Those weren't albino kids, that was computer camp! Rach!
Well, I wanted to be thorough. I mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us! And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!
I know what you mean, I've always wondered how different my life would be if-if I'd never gotten divorced.
Oh.
Seven years. I mean we've been together seven years, she's the only woman who's ever loved me, and the only woman I've-I've ever....
I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
No, it's okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I don't...
Look at him. I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in.
I know!
Yeah, yes it is, I was just moistening the tip.
Can I, can I help you with something?
Oh, just hold on a second. I'm watching this rugby thing on ESPN. I don't know what the big deal is. I'm man enough to play this sport.
'Why don't you call him?!' Well, thank you very much! Y'know now he is going to prep her, y'know prep her, as in what you do when you surgically remove the boyfriend!
No, no, Dad, I was just wondering.
Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it.
What's a matter with me? You've got a black light. It's 1999!
But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.
Yeah. Yeah. Yes, this place is beautiful. Emily's parents got married here.
Yeah.
Now umm, remember I'm still learning.
That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
Oh yeah, why not?
That's, that's nice twice!
Hey guys!
Hey guys.
You wanna watch Laverne y Shirley?
I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.
Hey, hey, woah, you want some of this, huh? You want a piece of this, huh? I'm standin here, huh.
And listen, man, if you wanna be gay, be gay. Doesn't matter to me.
Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see the baby.
All right that's, that's it!! Get off her!
What, uh... what juggling thing?
Green. To the green.
Uh, excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe. Evolution is scientific fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity.
What, that wasn't the great news?
Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.
Thanks. Thanks. And thanks again.
Hi, Julie. Hi, Julie. Julie, um, how are you?
Hey Rach!
But...
Eat your fish.
Okay, let's go.
Yeah, can't help but.
I am really not going. I don't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married?
Oh no!
Bye.
Jasmine?
Look, I'm not trying to get out of anything, okay. I thought our relationship was dead!
Oh. How do you uh, ya know, keep it so neat?
Ohh! Okay! Okay. "There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into..."
Small...
No! No! It would be weird if we were still in that place, I mean are you still in that place?
What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way.
Bye!
You know, you know, actually it's getting better. It is. It is. Let's not go. Anyone for Thcrabble?
Well, I gotta go. Bye. Bye, Rach.
Hey, we can rescedule for Saturday.
I want to go to the bathroom.
Hey! What's up?
Wait! Wait! Wait! Y'know what? Just stay. Please? It uh... It would really mean a lot to me if you stayed.
Really?! Wow! That's-that's so nice, what are you gonna get me?
Is this about Mark?
I like it, and Emily likes it, and that's what counts. So uh, how are you guys doing?
So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?
Yeah, it's really 6:00 tomorrow night our time.
Hi.
No, no, that won't be ah, that won't be necessary
And the Irish guy wins the joke!
Oh you know, pretty much the usual, uh, sun shining, birds chirping.
Carol our sex life is-it's just not working...
So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don't have to sell those cookies anymore.
That's, that's funny. Change!
It was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back!! Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means 'you are,' Y-O-U-R means 'your!'
Oh, no no, I am.
You know, that Steffi Graf has quite a tush. I'm just saying, it's right there.
Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine.
I'm gonna get a new band-aid. Hey, how 'bout the time I cut the legs off your Malibu Ken?
Well now let's-let's look at this objectively, I think I should date her...
Okay! Okay! Okay! It's okay. It's okay. Hey, it's too weird for you, I won't see her again.
No, no, no, no, no, no, not out of that, not out of clothes.
I know.
Okay!
I couldn't possibly eat another bite.
And they knew about it?
Yeah!
According to Chandler, what phenomenon scares the bejeezus out of him?
Hey guys!
Yeah.
I really wish that you wouldn't.
You look great. I, uh... I hate that.
You want me to call her right now?
Great, how did it go?
She, she was different.
It really was!
Alright. The, uh, the neighbours must be vacuuming. Well, so long as we're here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um...
Hey, I don't know what to tell you guys that's the doll he chose.
It's a clown kit! Clown kit!
But, Elizabeth and I are-are both adults and so I don't think there's really anything you can do about it.
Yes! We're getting married?!
Come on that's not fair! I mean you haven't even heard me play!
No!
Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet.
Mmm.
Am I! Am I! Am I out of my mind! Am I losing my senses!! This dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend out for a meal.
No-no-no, it's just a bit sudden. No, it's great. Okay? I'm totally on board. I love you too, all righty. Bye.
Pheebs, what are you doing?
It felt like a 'big guy' moment.
Look I've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one!
Yeah. You, uh, you want some?
But it absolutely didn't. It didn't!! It didn't!!
Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on campus where students went to uh, fool around.
Calm down, I'm blow drying.
Look, I'm not being any of those things, ok, I'm just being realistic.
Again, very sorry.
Noo!
Oh good, you scared me for a minute.
Ow!!
Sorry, I'm sorry. Close, close, close...
Joey?! Joey!!
I can't, I can't even believe her! No, y'know what, I am, I am gonna go!
Did you say something?
I-I know. Well if something comes up...
A lot of other gas smells...
Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the matter with you?
Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun..uh... I can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom.
No! No! No! The "Come here to me" is y'know for the ladies.
Oh.
That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!
Listen, you are hearing one side of the story, okay-and F.Y.I she must've shown Kyle over 30 paint samples before she painted that room! And his response to each one was, "I don't give a tiny rat's ass."
Let me hold him for a sec. There. Huh? There we are.
Hey!
Go Joe!!!
No-no, that's-that's not my thing! I do not love getting divorced!
Um, no.
C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact!
This screen is amazing, I mean Dick Van Dyke is practically life-size.
Y'know what I didn't wear this suit for a year because you hated it. Well, guess what? You're not my girlfriend anymore so...
You took my watch?
Hey!
Oh. Yeah?
Yeah.
...As in Mouse?
Hey, what are you doing shopping at eight in the morning?
Fine, just stop thinking about me.
Okay, this play, I want you to do a down and out to the right. Okay. Break!
Will you hold Ben for a sec? Come here. Come here.
As in, "I now pronounce you wife and wife" married?
Split it?
Yeah.
Aw, y'know...Y'know, maybe we're-we're just approaching this all wrong. If you're Chandler and-and you wanna hide, where is the last place on Earth people would think you'd go?
Hey.
Look guys, when I'm with her it's-it's-it's like she brings this-this-this great side out of me. I mean I-I-I love her, y'know?
Right. Okay, let's play. Let's go.
Yeah?
That is an old, Chinese woman!
No but, no but.
Hey, tell Dan, 'Thanks.'
Who gets whom. I don't know why I do that.
Ahhhh!!
Thanks! Ugh, I can't believe you're not gonna be there!
No!! Y'know-y'know don't do me any favours. In fact, where, where's the rest of my stuff?! Huh? Like-like my umm, Hey, this book is mine!! And-and-and, and that T-shirt you sleep in? I'd like that back too. Yes, I do.
You know what, this is ridiculous, ok. This is your birthday, this is your party. I say we just put 'em all together and if they can't deal with it, who cares.
I'm hurt! I'm actually hurt, that you would think that I would send you any of those things out of any thing other than love. Hurt! Hurt!
Four letters: "Circle or hoop".
No.
Really?! I mean, really?!!
You don't-you don't want to hear about my dream Officer...Pretty?
No! But we-we didn't have...sex-uh, did we? I mean, I don't remember much about last night, it was such a blur.
Scotch. Alright, I'll be back in 10 seconds with your scotch on the rocks in a glass.
Wait, how do you zoom out? There she is.
No-no, I got the edge. I know it's not exactly ethical but I sent him a little bribe to
Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?
Uh, I don't know, whatever.
I wanted this to work so much. I mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you back.
I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y'know, she'd say no, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!
Oh, by the way, great service tonight.
And that's funny, why?
Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now.
Women tell each other everything. Did you know that?
Yeah! I opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that's been happening to me. I mean I talked for hours. It is amazing to have someone give you such-such focused attention.
Chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl!
I'm gonna pay for that tonight.
Can I use.. either thumb?
That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! Oh, let's see now he had the trampoline.
No-no, one daddy, two mommies. All right, it's all yours.
Yes.
Oh God!
When, when were you... under me?
Um, Monica and I aren't supposed to play football.
Correct! What is Chandler Bing's job?
Chandler. When did he... when did he... when did he?
What?! What?!
With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa!
All right, we have a tie. Luckily, I have prepared for such an event. The Lightning Round!
Hey, Mon.
What?!
Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! Now remember what we talked about, you gotta be strong.
Fine, OK! Heat, heat, heat, and I'm the obsessive one. OK, this way is on, so this is. . . off.
Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work.
No! Do you wanna hear it?
That's closer.
I was their first born! They thought she was barren! It's not my fault.
Ah, yeah, yeah. Umm, we started talking after she y'know, did her thing. And it turns out she's got a boy about Ben's age, so we're taking them to a gym-boree class. Why, is that okay?
I gotta get to work.
Hopefully.
When we first met her, she was soaking, her feet were wet! Who wouldn't be miserable? I'm telling you when I got her into a dry pair of shoes, she was a totally different person.
Well I had a great time! Umm, Chancy on the other hand...
I know.
Yeah, I'm gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.
Y'know actually it does have a very interesting history. Uh, this street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system. Before that sewage and waste would just flow right down the street. Yeah, sometimes ankle deep!
Alright. : Your money's mine, Green.
No, it's not just 'cause I'm jealous. I mean I'm not, I'm not, I'm not jealous, okay? It's... Look, the guy, he screamed, he actually screamed at this couple sitting in our seats.
Kristen, hi. Are you uh, new to the area, 'cause if you are...I'd love to show you around sometime.
You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.
Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee.
Hey, it's been like three weeks!
Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, I'm a doctor, and I had a monkey. I'm Doctor Monkey!
Monica! Would it?
Yeah, well...nah.
Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for you, didn't she?
Monica, come on now. Let's go, baby coming.
Yeah, you're right.
Really? I mean, I, I had a whole speach prepared.
Hey, Pheebs!
You got me.
...How long was I in there?
Hey-hey, it's valid okay? And I'm not the only one who thinks so, Monica agrees with me.
I'm reading your ad.
Here we come, walkin' down thethis doesn't smell like Mom's.
I think the check in is that way.
No! For all I know, she's trying to find me but couldn't because I kept moving around. No, from now on, I'm staying in one place. Right here.
Yes!
No. Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing.
Nothing! There's nothing to do! I mean, she lives there, I live here. I mean, she-she'd have to uh, move here. She should move here!
What-what do you mean?
We got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category! Look, it's almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice?
And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay? So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing. Now, I know what you're thinking, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you're right, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with...girls.
Ok, ok, here is to my sister, the newly-appointed head lunch chef--
Hey, here's a thought.
Is it? Feels like two.
Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now.
Oh really! Why is that?
Coffee sounds great. Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?
That's right! That's right! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat so the pee goes everywhere!
What?
Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch.
The sex? Um, I'm having enough trouble with the image of you and Susan together, when you throw in Tanya , yaw...
Oh, we just...
Show them to me!
And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani.
Sweep, sweep....
Great. Great.
Em-Emily? Em-Emily? Emily!
Okay, I'm the baby.
No, I tried that. She says it has a weird smell.
Hi.
Well, not really. I mean technically it's-it's not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.
Give me two.
What?
Well why not?! She'll-she'll love it! It's the real thing! I got it at Pottery Barn.
Yeah.
Well, I kinda half to. I mean, because the thing is...
Oh no-no-no, we're just two people who happen to run into each other here at the coffee house.
You were trying to eat it!
Look it's the artist formerly known as Chandler.
Man, I sure miss Julie.
The screaming guy?
Okay! Okay! Fine, I'll stop! No teaching, okay? We'll just watch the pretty light streaking across the sky. Okay? Who's official name is Bapstein-King.
Come on. You gotta help me figure out what to do. Okay?
Fine. I'll go.
Of course it is. Yeah, come on in. Ooh-ooh, go by the window you can pretend to be surfing.
Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?
Two seconds...
This is perfect! She'll have to come back here with your pizza, and when she does, I'll turn on the Charm-O-Ross. Oh I'm so glad you don't eat meat.
But-but Cailin, he definitely will scream.
Okay, I'll be up in, 18 pages. Front and back. Very exciting.
Well, that makes sense.
To London! Come to London. Please? It'll mean so much to me.
Everything? Even the TV?
You know what it's fine. If you're okay with the Barbi thing, so am I.
Please be kidding.
My God. Rachel! Your here. I can't believe it. What happen? Why are you here?
Ahh, what's a little mid-life crisis between friends?
Yeah?
I think we proved our point.
Uh-huh.
Hi.
Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!
What's ah, what's so funny about that?
Hi, is Rachel there?
Excuse me?
Monica said that did she?
Well, fine. Fine! If-if I'm the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word, I'll go up there and defend it myself! And don't you follow me!
Phoebe, why is your bag moving?
No, no, no, no. Tick, tick, tick, tick.
It's my joke.
Same difference.
Okay.
Got me.
Grazie.
You tell them to wait!
Sorry.
Oh. Oh, that's right. So-so you did see me that day because it seemed like you didn't.
Yeah.
Let me see, I gotta see, I gotta see. Oh, a head. Oh, it's, it's huge. Carol, how are you doing this?
That was the water fountain! Okay?! Anyway, people are writing reports for me, uh pushing back deadlines to meet my schedule, I'm telling you, you get tough with people you can get anything you want. Hey Tribbiani, give me that coffee! Now!
No.
Hey.
It was, it was okay.
Yeah I am! Yeah, Ben got a second audition!
Hi.
I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
You ever figure out what that thing's for?
Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So techincally, technically I didn't break any rules. Thanks for stopping by though.
I have to say Tupolo Honey by Van Morrison.
Ah Joey, I don't think you get to pick the cities.
Does she.
No, I'm getting back down 'cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she's like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.
Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here-but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?
What? No! No! I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe-Ooh, although I did get some great Pottery Barn sheets!
Uh, oh-ho bye.
Hi there. How many, how many ah, did you sell?
I'm having... I'm having a baby. I'm having a... Where's the phone? The phone?
...Now that was fun.
So, I'll umm...
Sure, I-I-I...
That said it was my sandwich?!
All we're saying is don't rush into anything.
What, do you, well umm, oh how about I come up there?
Uhh, hey look, I don't really enjoy being with other men that way. But, um, zoo dollars?
Of course it's your friend Tanya.
You're welcome.
Mon, speaking of which, dad says he knows someone you can call for an interview.
Look let's not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time thing. It doesn't even matter!
You told her!
So what's a matter, you need a dentist? I've got a good one.
There you go. You put on a tuxedo! Now that wasn't so scary, was it?
Cassie?!
Hey Mon.
How much did you pay for that?
No. I think you misunderstood what I was saying. What I meant was...
I don't know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will do it. I'll go over and I will borrow something. Juice!! I need juice!!
Am I?!
Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part... But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.
I'm so glad you're going on this trip!
The big book of childrens' names.
No. I am not putting on makeup.
I got some, uh, hers and hers towels for Susan and Carol. And, uh, I got this blouse for mom.
Come on guys, I-I really want this guy to like me. It-it would really help me out if you guys were here to make me look good.
What?
You don't understand! Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip with her! Is that taking it slow?! No, I'm not ready for this! Okay? What-what do I tell her?
'Cause I know what you're trying to pull here. Okay? It's not gonna work.
It's your turn.
Pheebs, I think she's great. Okay? We're going out again.
Look, you guys don't need me here taking up your space.
Rach.
I see. So what do you propose to do?
Monica, you're so lucky! He's like the most popular guy in school!!
Hey, where'd you get that?
Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line.
Yeah.
Whoah, uh, what happened to, uh, 'Forget relationships! I'm done with men!' The whole, uh, penis embargo?
What can I do, she doesn't listen to me about renter's insurance either.
Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's, uh, it's a song. The laundry song that we sing. Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh.
You're welcome.
Yeah.
Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?
You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you.
Hi. Sorry we're late but we werewell, there was touching.
What do you mean? Nothing happened! I had to get out of there.
No, no you don't understand the animal hospital is way across town he's choking I don't know what else to do.
Yeah, all right, it's a date.
Oh my God!
You're wrong.
Everybody put their balloons down!!! Now this is a nice suit!!
Yeah, okay.
Hey hey, we'll be fine. We're just gonna need a little time.
What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer.
Umm, she kissed me.
Hey uh, y'know that smell gas has?
Chandler!
I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.
I just wanna clarify this: are you outing Mr. Peanut?
Just one uh, one additional relationship thought. Probably something your already familiar with, uh, women talk!
You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know?
Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid. I mean look at him, look at you,
Not only did we go out, we did it 298 times!
Well, we should probably get going.
What woman?
I want to take my tongue... and...
Ok, what the hell happened back there?
How are you?
Wow! The only thing I got from my Grandmother was her eyes. I mean not-not her actual eyeballs, but, but people say that my eyes-Do-do you want to make out?
I don't know Rachel, why?
Oh, darnit, we're all out of milk. Hey Chandler, would you fill me up here?
You gotta hear this story.
Okay.
C'mon, you know everyone I've been with. All, both of them.
Fine! Fine! But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here, "If you accept full responsibility..." Full responsibility! "...I can begin to trust you again. Does that seem like something you can do. Does it?!!"
Yeah! Got it!
Oh my God!
Uhh, yeah it would! Let's do it!
Ah, what good are you.
Okay, okay. This morning you said there was nothing so big that we couldn't work past it together...
Break!!
No-o-o! No way!
Hello!
Oh.
Thank you for bringing her into our lives.
You? You! Want to watch Ben? Yes! That'd be great, no, I just wanted to ask Monica, because I know how empty her life is.
What?! No!
Nooo!! Gandolf?! Gandolf is coming to town?
Hey, honey.
Like buddies.
It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff.
I mean, I, I-I admit I-I wasn't quite there. Y'know, I mean the thought of you and that-that Josh guy...
'Scuse us
Hey!
Correct, his profession was?
A little.
What?
Yes, yes of course, what-what would this be regarding?
Look, face it, my father is not going to pay for the build-in barbecue and believe me you can kiss you gazebo goodbye. Now I might be able to get you the new lawn.
Yeah, would you please consider moving here? I mean you were gonna move here anyway, why can't you just do that?
That's it, your doing great.
Yeah?
Ahhhh!!
No, but, your-your mad.
What happened?
Come on, Chandler.
-she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation?
Hey! Hi!
What?
Look, this is a disaster! Can't I please just go?
What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.
You know how close women can get.
Hey, I've been married 3 times
You know the song! Sing along!
No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't think breast milk is for adults.
You had fantasies about Emily?
Yeah?
I'm sorry.
No, you guys, I mean my keyboards are all the way up in-No, yeah, okay.
You okay?
I fell asleep!
'Cause Carol's a lesbian. And, and I'm not one. And apparently it's not a mix and match situation.
What kind of problem?
I think this will be fine. Okay, vanilla milkshake, just a vanilla milkshake, with chicken bits floating in it. Cheers.
Yes, I did.
Nevermind.
You mean hardball?
That uh, that was pretty funny. Wasn't it?
What are you doing here?!
Uh-hmm, yeah-yeah do you like it? Do-do you looove it? I just want you to know that I'm changing your grade back.
Marlon?!
Okay, I didn't know you would say that.
Ssshh.
So it's really a question of who could you have possibly done.
What?!
Hello! Oh, sorry.
C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,...
Umm, jealous!
what's up, Dad?
Thanks.
Yeah, well.
Oh, man. Oh, remember when I stuck that broom in your bike spokes, and you flipped over and hit your head on the curb?
Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you. When you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo.
Susan Sarandon.
Yeah.
Go ahead.
Oh no! Hey-hey, I'm the guy! I'll get it.
And I'm sure you're gonna make a big impression. Hi! I'm Rachel Green. It's nice to meet you. Come on, you probably have a broken rib!
Well, I suppose we just try to not look directly at it.
No.
Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.
Oh come on! That's-that's... true.
No. No, y'know you don't, you don't wear enough of this. What?
Heavy thing, not getting lighter!
You're not laughing.
Hey, thanks Rach.
Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots.
What? Ow!
Yeah, yeah, I was watching. Umm, hey, a couple of questions though. Umm, about that-that-that last move where the woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next?
Oh, thank you. Hey, hey. Rachel!!!!
Look Emily, I'm just having dinner with my friends, okay?
Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.
Believe me, I've been dreaming about me and Rachel for ten years now. But now, I'm with Julie, so it's like me and Julie, me and Rachel, me and Julie, me and... ... Rachel. Rachel, Rachel.
This place is really beautiful!
Hmm? Oh, yeah.
Hi honey, how did it go?
Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'Cause I-I got nothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do. Okay then. Here we go. Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again? Ask again later. Later is not good enough. Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!
What?!
Rachel, ready or not, here comes your knight in shining. . . oh no.
Hi!
Hey, does anybody want to get some lunch? All those in favor say I?
How's Monica coming along with her vows?
I was barefoot. Now tell me, the toilet thing is the only thing you taught him right?
Yeah, were better off without them.
No, um, see 'cause that, that is, that is the staging area. If you go in there, it'll ruin the whole illusion of the party. Yeah, I think you take your scotch back in there and I will get your cigarettes for you sir.
Yeah.
I'd like to return this couch. I'm not satisfied with it.
Oh, you could just go uh, "greatest of ease... BAH-bah-bha-bhannn." Then go right into it.
Oh my god! I'm so sorry, Cheryl. I must have freaked out.
My apothecary table!!!
Well, is this Hillary your HOT assistant chef Hillary?
Are you into crafts at all?
It's just, my part seemed to be over pretty quickly and then, and then there was a lot of waiting around.
...But a man can change.
Oh yeah, we're uh, yeah we're not together.
Hi. I understand you had a little talk with Emily.
Yeah, Sarah, anything.
Well, yeah.
Okay!! Okay!!
Your not going.
Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by "bye!"
It does. It really and truly does.
Yeah, c'mon I mean I though, you know, I thought we're just foolin' around. Like when, uh, when we were kids.
Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out.
Sure. Joey...
Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben but I-I will figure something out. Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?
Marenge,
Well, I'm sorry, but ah, look if you're not working with him anymore, why do you have to still do stuff with him?
59 seconds. Quartz, ha.
Not that it's any of your business, but we did go out.
I'm in.
Yep! Yeah, see this says D-13, and uh...
Yeah, i-it's for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they don't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them to give us the boit'sit's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. So here's my itinerary . Um... here's a picture of me...
Wow! I have never had such a healthy break-up! She was such a grown-up about it! She didn't seem too immature for me! Did I just make a huge mistake?
I'm here.
Look, look, there's got to be a way we can work past this. Okay, I can't imagine, I can't imagine my life without you. Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart. Your good heart Rach, and, and....
I know-
Well I'm, I'm a little slow. Just as our children would be.
Y'know your probably not allowed to sleep with any of your students.
Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture.
Of course.
All right. I'll uh, I'll see you later, okay?
We got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach. It's a boy, definitely a boy! All right! Ok, legs, knees, and feet. Oh, oh. He's here. He's a person.
You can have the last piece, if you want.
I don't know, God, I... well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know? She's, she's sexy, she's...
Well, he's finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head?
Good for you.
So, then you can stay as long as you want.
Hey!
I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!
Hi. Mom. Dad.
Yeah!! Yeah!
Ugh. It's definitely getting worse.
Oh Pheebs, that's great. It doesn't count.
Hey, how'd the date go with Mr. Millionaire?
Hi Dr. Greene. So, uh, how's everything in the uh, vascular surgery....game?
Oh my God, what happened?
Move in with me.
You see Amanda and I have a very special...
Anyone want me to appraise anything?
Aw, how can you say that? I cant even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid?
A big idiot. Just you have to realize is, this whole Mark thing is kinda hard for me.
Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.
Hi!
Where is she?
No, no, no, this weekend guys!
It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work. And I do, I have to make this marriage work. I have too. But the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here.
Yeah. And did you, did you pack that bathing suit?
...so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles.
Rach! Wait! The men's room is that way.
So umm, where are the other guys?
Wow, couples who live together do start to look alike. So, Mondler...uh, what uh, what 'cha doin?
Hey! It's 42-21!
No.
Oh, Liam. So uh, what, were you guys playing soccer or something-or should I call it football?
Yeah-oh! Hey listen umm, Emily found this wedding dress in London...
Oh no.
C'mon Rich, it's my birthday, let me live vicariously.
Are you serious?
All right. Y'know what? We don't have to go downstairs! We can bring Vegas up to us! All right, come on, come on, we'll play some blackjack. Here we go. 13.
Yeah.
Wo-wo-whoa. What about Phoebe's birthday?
Please hurry.
Pheebs, you're talking about putting your body through an awful lot, I mean morning sickness, uhh, labour, and it's all for somebody else!
That's it? You're not mad? I mean, it must've been terrible.
Oh, mom. Mom. Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food.
Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.
Look, no-no, hey, hey, don't worry about it! In nine years, she and I will be right there.
Well, but, but. . .
Are you sure? Because I can stay out as late as you want. I told you how I'm on sabbatical from work, right?
I don't know if it's true.
Okay, first of all, I don't play with cheaters, and second of all, you know I had swollen glands!!
Do not give him any money!
Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last year? Can I see it?
Nope. I mean, I know Susan does every year, but I think I wanna take this year to teach him all about Hanukkah.
Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.
Yeah, I have a question. When is this gonna air?
Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?
OK, my hands were no where near your butt.
Oh my God! Monica!
It gives it a nice antiquey look.
Wooooooo, hehehe. Hey, ahh, you don't feel like you're gonna throw up, do ya?
Um-hmm! Doesn't that sound delicious at the last minute?
Monica, I'm cutting you off.
Hey!
Well, I'm gonna go get ready, for my date tonight, so ah, I'll just_ head.
Okay. Um, how about these?
I had to talk loud because the movie was loud!
She was...
Look, were down to just one point. Could we please, maybe just settle it after the wedding.
Hello!
No, I fold.
Marcel. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Good boy. Good boy. C'mere, gimme the rice. Thank you, good boy. Well, I see he's finally mastered the difference between 'bring me the' and 'pee in the'. 'Bring me the' and- Rach?
Why-why would I care about that?
What?
Hi everyone.
That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this conversation.
Why does anyone have to be naked?
Look, if you'd had two failed marriages, you'd understand!
That's funny. Umm.... It's not funny.
Oh no-no-no, it's my pleasure.
Hey?
No, that's, no, as long as you're okay. So I'll ah, I'll see you tomorrow.
You're over me?
Wow!
It was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back!! Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means 'you are,' Y-O-U-R means 'your!'
My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, I went to see it, and there were students makin' babies right in the middle of the Paleontology section!
Oh-ooh!
Mee mee, mee-mee mee.
So you guys, who else did you tip with cookies?
She's not even here yet.
Okay Rach, but...
Ah, the lesser-known "I don't have a dream" speech.
Mark is that ah, the same Mark that helped you get the job?
Yeah, I'll get right on that.
This is so exciting, I haven't seen my monkey in almost a year.
I'll get it! I will get that!
That's who.
I'll take that dad.
Okay.
Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch.
Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so...
Where the hell have you been?
Well...
Oh God, no.
Oh, see from where I was sitting I uh. . .
Good.
Mike "Gandolf" Ganderson, only like the funest guy in the world.
Is there blood coming out of my ears?
No, I, I only know Lipson.
What?
I don't know. What's in this pie?
Sorry.
No, I can't. I would, I really would, but my son is here; I can't leave him. Isn't-you don't think there's any way?
Oh no-no-no! Oh-no! No! No! Emily!
It's my new apothecary table!
What's going on?! That's what's going on!!
Oh no-no-no-no!
Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.
Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didn't bring you here so you can ambush her.
Hey!
Yeah, but, but look what I'm...
C'mere, Marcel.
She's having lunch with him. She's having lunch with him. And you should of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job. And, and, and, he's really good looking. What am I gonna do?
Monica, Monica, you could come in straddling him, they still wouldn't believe it. We're here.
Yeah. Maybe today is just, close call day.
No, of course not! ...Yeah, yeah, it is.
Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico.
Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls?
That must be our alcohol and beers!
Uh-huh. Thank Joey!
Yeah, well, m-maybe you're right.
Oh no! It could be better, but it's gonna be okay, right?
Hi!
What the hell are you doing? You scared the crap outta me.
Four.
Yeah! Got it!
Le Poo's still alive?!
Great! Uh, let me take this up for you.
Yeah!
Yeah.
Over here.
No, it's not just that. It's justI want someone who... who does something for me, y'know? Who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes me, uh...
Gimme back my monkey.
Yeah-No!!
No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.
Yeah sure.
I... ahem... I really don't think so.
Yes! Ben learned a little trick.
Nice. And by the way that uh, that line down my face?
Okay.
E-except, except that what?
No! No! Not-I don't mean I-I see her as a twelve-year-old girl! I mean I-I have a son, who's umm six and I still think of him as a baby.
Sweetie, you gotta relax. Everything's gonna be great, okay? Come on. Come on.
Or Joseph.
Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did.
Well, I just spoke to Carol. Ben's got the chicken pox.
Happy for you.
What's wrong with this year?
Electrifying. Emphatic time-time-time...
Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.
Is that supposed to be an insult?
Yeah.
Hey.
Yep.
Okay.
Come on sweetie! You've had to work late every night for the past two weeks, what is it this time?
Ok. Here's his diaper bag, and his uh, Mr. Winky, and uh...oh, him. Hi!
That's true, thanks dad. People should be dancing! Huh? Hey, this is a party! Come on! Joey, dance!!
Yeah.
I like that.
Good.
Yeah, see, I don't think it's gonna that difficult considering this one won't be taking place in the basement of a Pizza Hut.
Not yet.
Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go?
Yeah, he's a little sensitive right now, `cause he's so in love.
Oh, wake up!
I could, yeah, I can do that.
Oh my God!
Thank you!
The first time! No seriously, imagine if Carol hadn't realized she was a lesbian.
Oh, hey, if I make you laugh, here's an idea, why don't you invite Paulo over and have a little romp in the sack and I'll just stand in the corner and tell knock-knock jokes.
Y'know, y'know I'm lookin' and I don't think anyone's home here. I say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and y'know explain later.
She was...
Hey man.
Very bad.
Hey! How long until Pete's fight?
But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.
Hey, I didn't know we were, uh, seeing other people.
Yes!! I knew it!! Bye-bye! So long! Later!
Tough noogies, we're watching Predators of the Serengetti.
I'm-I'm Ross by the way.
Hi. She said yes.
Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know. So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so. . .
Oh.
Marcel! What've you done to him?
Well, it's not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the park who thought Ben was really cute--y'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning.
Ohh! That would be great.
A tattoo? Why, why would you want to do that? Hi.
Well. Hey...
Something could've happened. All right? She-she really dug my slides. And-and she was definitely giving me the vibe.
So-so come! Why don't you come?
Okay, Fonzy gives you two thumbs up, collect two cool points. Yeah.
Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen.
Tony?
Hi!
Yeah, I kind of uh, have something else planned for you guys.
OH MY GOD!! I didn't really believe it until you just said it!!
You can see where he'd have trouble.
I'm familiar with his work, yes...
What-what-what the-how da-how did-what the-how did-what?!
A woman in my office is a lesiban. I'm just saying.
I just found out that Elizabeth's dad wants to meet me.
Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night? Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!!
Hey Mon!
Oh. Hey, who's Carl?
Well I'm sorry but, that-that's really not my problem.
Who?
Something about hi.
Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, uh, do you...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent.
Pheebs, you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec?
What?! What? How do you, how do you even know its broken?!
It was, it was her voice.
Hi.
Nope.
Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let's try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin. Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin... ...does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!
We're here!
Hey, what's going on?
There are naked ladies there too.
The gas is odorless, but they add the smell so you know when there's a leak.
I'm the ring bearer.
Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-
Okay, I got us a court date for tomorrow at 2:00 and I picked up all the forms. I'll take care of everything.
J-j-just relax, nobody yelled. Jack just was calling to make sure that you were getting better.
Oh yes, the weenie from Torrini.
Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here...
What? Ow!
She hates Pottery Barn?!!
Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I left.
Rachel, I've seen you naked a million times. I ate hot fudge off you naked. Remember, I-I sucked that mini-marshmallow out of your belly button?
Hey.
All right.
What?
Hey, I know what'll get us up on a platform!
Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole 'Does it?' part just another glance.
I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! And the guys from work had a blast. Y'know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, so...
...can't, can't a guy send a barbershop quartet to his girlfriend's office anymorrrrre!!
Hi Janine!
No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.
Just, y'know out.
I couldn't.
Hey, you're a doctor of gums. That's the smallest body part you can major in. It's like day one, floss. Day two, here's your diploma.
Yeah, if you're really hungry. It was a joke, I made a joke.
No. No.
Oh, I'm sure.
Alright boys, let's eat.
Yeah?
Yeah, what, what was I thinking?
Who's that?
Carol, honey, shhh, shhh, everythings gonna be alright.
Get away!
Look, I do not re-love her.
Ah, I'm sorry.
What?
What?
She, she was different.
Wh-what's up?
I was thinkin' about it.
Joey's not going.
Okay, it's coffee.
Okay, good bye!
I'm gonna call after you!
Y'know if we ever go to war and you're captured, you're in for a big surprise.
I don't think tho.
I know, I know. Everybody, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Yeah. This is Ben. Ben, this is everybody.
Hootie and the--oh my. I, I can catch them on the radio.
Hey!
Everyone, this is Julie.
Y'know what? I'm really not in the mood.
Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and he's so cheap, he'd never fly to London in a million years. Yeah, invite him? Hey, did I do these neat enough?
Hi!
Yeah, well.
Your mother's right. Take her, you can wear my tux.
Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I.
My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-
Ahh, no, I'm good.
Hey! Hey! Hey! I get to choose my best man, and I want both you guys.
That was 14 hours ago.
I don't know you guys.
I can't believe you let George Michael slap you.
No problem.
No, I'm genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn't work out. Look, Rach, I want only good things for you.
Hi!
That is so good! Do it again!
No.
Howard?
No! No! Wh... What are you doing?!! GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
FINE BY ME!!
Don't yell at me okay, this is the most I've seen you all week.
Okay, okay, okay. I'll get the bagels.
Look both, Joey and Monica feel the same way that I do. No-no-no-no.
Hey!
Why don't you come, I mean, I-I have two tickets, why not?
I want my turkey now!
The carbon, it's messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes, the, the ah, night blindness.
You wanna wander in the hall? Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?
Oh, I'm threatened by you?
Where's my ring? My dead grandmother's wedding ring? Where is it? Where is it?
Great to see you!
Okay, look, we have nineteen minutes. Okay, Chandler, I want you to go and change! Okay. And then, when you come back, Joey will go change, and he'll have vacated the chair. Okay. Okay.
Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. Good.
I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me.
I had a 'K'. Where's where's my 'K'?
Come again? What's-what's this nonsense? All right, I'm-I'm not English. I'm from Long Island. I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out. I'm sorry. So, if we could just get back to the lecture. Umm, were there any questions? About paleontology. All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression. Obviously, I screwed up. But what you guys think of me is really important because I'm-I'm hoping to get a permanent job here. So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression...
Dad that won't matter to her. Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all her is-is, is growing new stuff! See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.
Yeah!
Yeah, y'know for dating, general merriment, taking back to your windmill...
No thank you for... Thank you.
You got ink on your lip.
Please.
No. Your mother really did the work. I was busy with the business. I wasn't around that much. Is that what this is about?
It's still a gift! I got it from the gift shop!
Oh My God, she-she made half a English Trifle, and half a...Sheperd's Pie!
Well, I guess I can check out those apartment listings, even though there's never anything in here.
I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo...
Alright.
I don't know what to do. What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare.
It's the-Chandler!!
I think this is it. I don't know, maybe we should keep looking.
What? What's wrong?
Thanks. Oh! So for tomorrow, do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?
Ohh, here's that Macadamia nut!
And somebody took a shot at me!
Oh. Uhh...
Yeah, he's head of the department.
Yeah.
Ow, ow, OK. Alright, alright, Mon, Mon, you've gone ultrasonic again, alright.
No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to know, absolutely not. I think, you know, I think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is! Or isn't...
Why don't you come, I mean, I-I have two tickets, why not?
Well, I-I was watching her the other day at the pizza place.
Huh...
Ahhhh!!
Hey, save us some pizza.
Uh-huh.
Oh.
Wait a minute, look.
I-I, did that for you.
Okay.
Oh thank you. Thanks very much. Ow!
Look, I know what you're going through. When I turned 50 I got the Porsche. You... you got your own little speedster.
Okay, that's, that's enough.
I've no idea, could be. Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight.
Hi!
Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?
Well, last weekend...
Nothing, nothing. Everything's under control.
All right, here's the ring.
It's her first day at this new job. Your not supposed to start with her!
Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?
Carol, what's the matter? What happened?
I think that would be best.
Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...
I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right.
Hey you guys.
How about we settle this right now! There! Now, no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha!
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on, come on, what. You took his underwear?
No. No, no. She doesn't want to see you right now.
Well...In-in case of emergency.
Yeah?
Uh, Rach, do you want me to shuffle those?
Hey! You were so right!
Ok. Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian.
No, because your not upset.
All right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again.
Here we go. Y'know, I've-I've never played my stuff for anyone before, so it's important that-that you understand it's about communicating very private emotions. Y'know, umm, you should-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems. That's what I'm...
Huh?
No, no, with him. I'm on this field, and they, they hike me the baby... and I, I know I've gotta do something 'cause the Tampa Bay defence is comin' right at me.
Well, umm, why don't you give him a call?
What are you doing?
I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment. What? What, now?
What's going on?
No.
Did I, did I even treat?
He gave me a pill for it.
...is for me not to see you anymore.
Oh yeah, I'd love that.
Now I'm depressed! ... Even more than I was.
My baby sister, ladies and gentlemen.
Monica's big night, she shouldn't pay.
It-it's great to meet you Paul.
No?
All right.
Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.
No, you started it.
Where there is no fear of commitment.
But, okay.
Yeah, okay you're right.
Well, yeah, of-of course I'm okay! What? I'm just being supportive. Supportive of you and this whole trip, and-and what-what is uh, what's this?
Did you see the look that girl just gave me? Huh? She must've seen me cruising in the bad boy.
You're back.
I can't believe no one believes me!
Yeah, which, which we have to leave for in exactly twelve minutes. All right, come on, I'll just pick something out for you.
Some days it's all I can think about.
How about all the way.
Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops?
The Geller Cup.
All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application.
No, look, hey, it's my birthday, and the important thing is that we all be together.
No.
Hey!
Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. Me, neither. I've had a really good time too, you know.
Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot. Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun.
Okay, she can't go.
Shh! Of course, why don't we go inside?
No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!
Oh.
You're gonna be an aunt.
You're drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe I'm a little drunk.
And if you wait right here, I'll go get Ross.
Thanks you guys.
Goodnight.
Yeah.
Yeah, but-but he didn't know that!
So uh, what did you tell them about me?
Oh, aaaah!
Just a smidge.
Yeah. Right. Save it. I can do that.
Hey Chandler, what are you doing tonight?
Oh my God! I love this apartment! Isn't it perfect?! I can't believe I never realized how great it is!
She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.
He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it.
No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel?
It was soo not an accident. She saw I was about to tag her, so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running.
Hi.
Oh, you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy, we call him Hums While He Pees.
Okay look, do-do, you have anything Christmassy? I promised my son, and I really don't want to disappoint him, um, come on, I...uh, you gotta have something.
So, Dr. Green, how's the old boat.
Thank you!
Hey!
Oh, actually I haven't even been home yet. Do you mind if I check my messages?
Open with a joke? It's a university, not a comedy club!
And it could've just as easily have been a bullet.
Yes.
That's what you said last night.
Joey, had an imaginary childhood friend. His name was?
I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there.
Y'know what, I don't know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.
Carol was wearing boots just like those the night that we- we first- y'know. Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause we-we- Sorry. Sorry.
Please, he refers to me as 'wethead'.
Uh, you weighted 200 pounds.
Hi.
Hey, you're right.
Hey everybody!
And! Break!!
So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?
Ah! Well uh-uh, t-take it downstairs, y'know give it a test ride.
Oh, you've tasted it.
How come it's not mixing with the water?
Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
What?
Hey you leave Marcel out of this!
Not nice enough.
What happened?
Are you out of your mind?
Yay!
Oh, come on!
Well, it was loong. I didn't even realise how late it was, until I noticed the 5 o'clock shadow on her head. Anyway, she didn't want to stay. I called a cab; she just left.
Yep!
Hey, I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
All right, keep going. We are phasing the accent out, phasing it out. So without out re-testing the results in the laboratory the team would never have identified the initial errors in their carbon dating analysis . Were there any questions at this point? Yes.
I am!
When?
Dude, what'd you have?
What?!
Oww!
No, I'm not gonna pick them up.
Hi!
Huh, I'm just saying...
What'd you say?
Hey, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
Whoo!
Oh, no!
Okay, quick and painful.
It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this.
What?!
He left that.
I don't know, I'm one sorry polentologist. All right Joey, we get it. I'm sorry.
I see your twenty, raise you twenty-five.
Well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings.
From you? Yes, please!
Us too.
Bye.
See what? I don't know what she sees in... innn that goober. And it takes him, what? Like... like... I don't know, uhh... uhhh, hello.... a... week, to get out a sentence.
I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk before.
And, I don't know, if it starts to rain...
Ooh! There's no way to do this without her? 'Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.
Look at you two, bonding, making us late for the airport so...
Hey, uh, you can ignore that.
Woah. Huh. You know about my, I mean, you know I had... you know?
Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.
Oh, well you see how it works is, the part with Dick Clark in Times Square is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. Yeah, not a lot of people know that.
Phoebe.
Oh my God, you guys!!
You know what I don't care. The only person I cared about getting dressed, is the one person that says she's not even gonna go. Look Rach, I'm sorry. Okay. Look, I-I wa, I was a jerk. I'm sorry I yelled. I want you there, I need you there. Look, what, what can I do that can show you how much, how much I want you to be there.
Hey, uh, I'm really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today.
You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
Okay... okay, maybe I will...
Hi Tushie.
And you're afraid you won't be able to...fill his shoes.
No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?
Okay. Hut! Hike!
Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn't make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say 'Like me! Like me tiny doctor!'
Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right?
Woooo!!!
A-A day.
Well if it doesn't matter to her, it doesn't matter to me! Still not yelling!
Okay Phoebe, I guess you're next although I really don't see the point.
Sure, sweepin'. You never know.
I'm gonna tell Mom.
We fell asleep! That is all.
Now she's passed.
Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch. Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y'know what I see, I see-I see division. Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, "My God why?!" Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath. I'm Ross! I'm divorced, and I have a kid!
'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?
Come on.
What?
Get the what?
What you don't think I'd go up to her?
It's okay. Come, come on in.
Okay. You uh, you wanna hear something weird?
Sure. Sure. Look I don't, I don't know if your plans are finalized yet, but umm, hey I-I know another great way to blow off steam.
Mom, there are so many people in my life. Some of them are seeing people and some of them aren't. Is that crystal?
My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. You guys probably wanna get some hugs in too, huh? Big news!
What a pity stay?
I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!
I bet if I talk to Carol and Susan I can convince them to move to London with Ben.
What?
In the bank.
Hey!
When Monica was a little girl, I remember that--Ooh!! Ow! Very good!
Oh, but-but I can't do it.
That's true, thanks dad. People should be dancing! Huh? Hey, this is a party! Come on! Joey, dance!!
So you two are really serious?!
Let's grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.
Wha-, oh, quit it.
You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?
Before the snap!
Well, OK, I uh, I have to. I can't deal with this right now. I mean, I've uh, y'know, I've got a cab, I've got a girlfriend, I'm... I'm gonna go get a cat.
Freakish.
I don't know, aheh, your's was the first name that-that popped into my head, I'm I'm sorry. I-I didn't think it would matter.
It's like that everywhere, Joey! Okay, Mon, back me up here. Where you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right? And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?
You bet. In the U.S., China, Africa, all over.
Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not laughing now, are ya pal!
Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!
Then where the hell have you been?!
C'mon kid, let's go.
All right, all right. You-you-you know what I'm going to do? I am going to order another pizza and when Caitlin gets here, you-you--I will show how well I flirt. Yeah! I will, I will get her phone number! And not the one on the menu!
Hey.
Yeah, hi, I was just beeped. No, Andr is not here. Third time today. Yes, I'm sure... No, sir. I don't perform those kind of services.
Well, I uh, I can't seem to find the monkey I donated last year. He's a capuchan, answers to the name Marcel.
You told her before you told us?
Hey guys!
There's nothing the matter with me. See, I'm not completely devoid of sentiment, see I have feelings.
Look, you can't do this Mon. All right, if you do this, I'm, I'm gonna, I'm, I'm gonna.....
Hey.
You can live with me.
Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along.
See, I would never snap at you like that.
What'd you do, take him whaling?
Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
Really?! So what would you say Pheebs? Stuff like uh, "Keep your mitts off my grub?"
It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
What do I do now?
It so does not!!!
That's right, Ben. I'm Santa's representative for all the southern states. And Mexico! But, Santa sent me here to give you these presents, Ben. Maybe the Lady will help me with these presents.
Diverse.
Fine. You'll-you'll watch it on video when we get back.
It's your joke.
Some of your old stuff.
Dad, dad I don't want to hear about it.
I guess so.
Take thee, Rachel... Emily. Emily.
Hey!
Well, excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life!
Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater.
Look at that, look at that, see how she's pushing him away and he won't budge. Alright, I'm gonna do something. Excuse me, are you Rachel?
Marcel is an illegal exotic animal. I'm not allowed to have him in the city. If they find him, they'll take him away from me.
Hey! That was a practical purchase! I needed that car for transportation! Okay? I-I have a child!
It's a rug.
OK, here goes.
All right, try pedaling.
Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything..ahh...
Probably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated.
Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?
What do you think you're doing?!
I need juice! People need juice!!
Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.
No, 19.
You're great. And I-I know someday this will happen for you too. You just hang in there.
We are never gonna find him! He's one guy in a huge city!
Thanks. What photo album was it?
I wasn't- I mean, I-
If like the four of us could all y'know, hang out together. Uh, in fact Emily's coming into town this weekend, why don't you say we all have dinner? Say, Sunday night?
I'm-I'm not kidding. Look I-I, I can't have three failed marriages. I can't. Okay? I-I am not gonna be that guy!
That's too bad.
I mean you're not gonna give me a-a ticket for driving too slow are ya?
Yeah, have a seat.
Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...Susan: Come in.
Uh, lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk when Roland's not there. Here's to my little sister--
Take from me, as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to say the right name.
Ohhhhh yeah, that's, that's funny. Why ah, why isn't he goofing around in his own office?
That's right, uh, Elizabeth Hornswoggle.
No. So what. So what if we get beaten up, maybe that's just something every man has to go through once in his life. Ya know, like a, like a right of passage or somethin'.
Uh Joey, that's just the minumum amount due, that's your total due.
You come out there, you're a dead man.
Get married.
I've been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don't, don't you think we can work on this?
Excuse me. Hi, I'm a professor here. Do you know the Paleontology section, fifth floor, stack 437?
Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a dream I had- but, phew.
Yes. I was just warming up the earpieces for you.
She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.
Thanks.
All right.
Eh, either way I'll pass. I still can't eat those. What's so funny?!
I told you there was going to be sub-titles.
Hey!
Goodnight.
Hey!
I'm agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe yet?
I can't believe this.
Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice...
She's not here yet. She's not here. She's having my baby and she's not here.
Look I was going to tell you!
Take thee, Emily. Like there'd be anybody else.
So, you gals wanna hand over your money now? That way, we don't have to go through the formality of actually playing.
Because, because I've got Ben.
Look, I was nervous! You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring! I got up there and they were all like staring at me. I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out.
What's up?
What's the matter?
Celebrities I'm allowed to sleep with.
I don't think charging new clothes too your dad qualifies as making it on your own.
Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?
And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.
Yes, and that's why we're here.
Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?
Phoebe!
What?
Hey!
Not-not really. Th-th-there was just Carol.
No. no.
Well we just wanted to stop by and uh, say goodnight.
What?!
Yeah that's the same.
Hey.
I think it means he freaked out and left!
Is this what you had in mind?
Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-
Uh, Rachel, I've been thinking. I don't think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. I'm calling it off.
Know what-If somebody doesn't tell me what's going on right now...
Uh-oh...
We already knew that!
That's okay, Joe.
I'm sorry.
No.
Yeah, what's going on?
No, no, that's not where I was going. Er, if you get in the... way, of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very sad.
No, but. . .
Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y-
Yeah, but still, cheap shot!
I know, but ahhhhhh!! I really wanna go up there and finish that kiss!
Oh for cryin' out loud!
What about the time I said we were on a break?
Hello to the rest.
I know. That's why I did it. Come on, are they really that bad?
Hey guys!
Hey!
How you doing?
Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name?
Wow Monica! Hey, just so you know I had my uh, older brother chat with Chandler.
Do you remember the scene with, um, Jabba the Hut? Well Jabba had as, as his prisoner, um, Princess Leia.
Huh? I know, I know. Who am I? David Bowe?
No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so...
Again, it's not that he...
So?
Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?
Yeah, I know, I uh, I tried them on.
I do have a newfound respect for life.
Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...
How 'bout instead you, go get changed! You, give him back his underwear! I'm gonna go get a cab, and I want everyone down stairs in two minutes! Monica!
No, just give me another minute.
That's okay, I'll just pick 'em off.
What? Great, now I'm having a baby.
Okay, you wanna play rough, we can play rough.
Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...
This would be the place where you explain the hat.
Okay, that's right, yes, but on Hanukkah, uh, we sing, uh Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
Ohh, okay.
Uh, Macy's, third floor, home furnishings.
And! We should keep all the stuff uh, we told each other secret from everybody else.
My nana used to do it. That's how she paid for all my dance-karate lessons.
I'm here. How's my little boy? Want Daddy to change your diaper? So, did you have fun with Uncle Joey and Uncle Chandler today?
Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well.
I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.
Thank you Gunther. We didn't want to have to go and do that.
Home is Home Star stew.
Oh what's the big deal?! I wasn't even invited to the ceremony, just the reception. And-and y'know what? If it makes you feel any better, Joan and I will just make an appearance and then, and then we'll-we'll leave early as a sign of protest.
Monica's right. We're talking about getting married here. Okay? She-she can't just rush into this.
No no, no no, it's not flashy, not for a Goodfella.
Phoebe, you can't massage people in my apartment!
Oh, it's my new beeper.
You know, I might have expected this of you Phoebe, but Ryan, you're a military man.
What? Where?
What's all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!
What time?
Yeah, just... just Nana stuff.
What, what.
Y'know what? I think I can take care of myself, I'll talk to you later. Good-bye. Whoa! Uh, that was your sister actually. She-she thinks that you're just using me.
: Could you take it to Carol's every now and then, and show it to Ben, just so he doesn't forget me?
Oh, yeah.
Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few hours, some kids messed up the Homo Sapien display.
Yes, of course they like you!
How's my little boy?
Yes! Wow, well, that-that was easy. Okay, you-you go.
Don't be silly. Ben loves you. He's just being Mr. Crankypants.
Okay, umm. Did you ever see, um, Return Of The Jedi?
Look, don't blame us. You guys coulda been there, you know.
Hi.
You still love me.
Anytime anything comes close to touching her eye or anyone else's she like freaks out. Watch! Watch!
Oh, this is Monica.
Actually it's the movie theatre that has the time schedule. So you don't miss the beginning.
Y'know, he hums when he pees!
Hey!
Oh my God!
I made fun of his accent.
Your joke? Well, I think 'the Hef' would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.
Well, you-you've always had glasses.
Ok. I'll see ya later. Just think about it, ok.
I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?
Dad, dad, please. Look I don't want anything to upset Emily tonight. Alright, she's had a hard enough couple of days as it is. Now here, here, let me go talk to him, okay?
What? What? What?
I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while.
I am so sorry.
It would be so cool to live across from you guys!
Hi, Mrs. Green.
Yep?
Hey!
Yeah, that's her.
Do not rush me!!
We're still married! Don't tell Rachel. See you later.
Okay.
Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we're never gonna get along.
Hey.
Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in college. I mean that's-that's when I really found my sound.
Yay!
Yeah.
Yeah.
No, I can't get it out.
Stop saying, "Blood" to strangers.
It's okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time, y'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could.
Knock-knock.
Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept.
So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made?
God, do you realize in ten years we're gonna be 40?
There you go.
WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!
You're joking, right? You guys just walked through the door.
Good, so do I
Happy Thanksgiving!
Come on, show them to me.
All right. Feel good?
What did you want to show us? Because all I can see is this bitchin' van!
I-I just thought you were doing so well. I...
Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this. And sometimes I may be away longer, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this.
Can I come over tomorrow and pick up Fluffy Meowington's cat toy.
This is crazy! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved her in the past, but now, she is just my wife! Phoebe, will you-will you help me out here?
Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October twentieth?
Oh yeah, yeah? Well uh, when we were going out, I read tons of porno magazines! 'Sup?
I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were so close Phoebe!
Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips.
Hey! There are some men who will do whatever it takes to make their marriage work! Okay? There are some men who will stand by and-and watch as their wives engage in-in what only can be described as a twosome with some-some woman she barely knows from the gym!
Correct. In what part of her body did Monica get a pencil stuck at age 14?
And that's not against your oath?!
Nobody likes change.
Hey!
What happened you guys?
I am dressed.
Well, this is ironic. Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didn't want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete can't.
Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.
Sorry-sorry Jill.
Do you know the word crapweasel?
Nothing, ah there was this thing at the museum. Come on. Easy.
Beef in a dessert?! I- no no no, there is no way!
Okay, so it wasn't uh, a traditional massage. But I did give him accu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. And, and I gently exfoliated him with, with a mop.
I know, why not?
Yeah.
Yeah, me too.
Bye Ryan.
Okay, Andr should be there in like 45 minutes. All rightie, bye bye. Just easier that way.
Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person.
Thanks, Gunther. Hey! Umm, can I get a napkin too?
Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn't happen!
I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh...
Yes, yes it is. In prison!
Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyone's name, so I-I kinda came up with nicknames. Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.
We were drunk! I would've married uh, Joey with that amount of alcohol!
Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?
It's not a library...
Oh, oh, you're... uh... you're, oh you're the date.
What're you talkin' about?
I'm never gonna find love again.
So, what's going on now?
Um, see, but that's not the final draft.
I don't think you have much choice.
Hi.
No!
Huh!
Y'know-thanks!
I'm having a son. Um...
Thanks.
Now, if you need to stay late, I want to be supportive of that.
No. No. No, I'm-I'm glad you did. Look, if nothing else, it's-it's always great when someone tells you they love you.
And if I remember correctly, Ray Ban was the official sponsor of World War I!
No!
Yeah. Yeah, oh you loved that thing. You always had it with you. You never went anywhere without-without that coloring book.
I can handle the stick!!
No, Susans gonna be there too. Weve got dads, weve got lesbians, the whole parenting team.
Okay.
Now, hold on! Hold on! Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I'm gonna be at that airport and I hope that she'll be there too! Oh yeah, I said Rachel's name, but it didn't mean anything, Okay? She's-she's just a friend and that's all! That's all! Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please, promise me that you'll tell her that.
Uh, so this play umm, what do you think? It's-it's gotten great reviews! Y'know the uh...
You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't've been fat.
I had a problem.
So uh, Emily just went to the airport.
Breathe.
Hey, what took you guys so long? Your cab left when ours did!
Hey!
G'night.
Why are you mad at me?
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!
No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batman's tux!
Neither will I.
I'll get it.
I, Ross...
Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?
I have an oily T-zone!
Ah.
Y'know, the kind of fun, you and Susan had when we were married.
And that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?
I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...
No! No! No! No-no-no-no.
Of course he is! What, do you think I'd just use my son as-as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am?
Hey!
Oh hey, Gary, want me to grab the berry for ya?
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Well then a small one!! Listen, let's, we kinda have to get going!
Okay, I think I might know why my parents don't like you.
What?
Well, as much as I'd like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I aren't going to be here. All right? I mean, she's going to come by first to say good-bye, and then I've got a whole special evening planned. So I'm sorry, no party.
You like it?
Oh, thanks Gunther. STUPID BRITISH SNACK FOOD!!!!!!!
One, two, three, four!
Oh, please. Sweetie it's hopeless, okay, I'm just gonna go.
Ohh, I gotta go to the flower store! Check it out, no one will tell me where Emily is, so I'm gonna send 72 long-stem, red roses to Emily's parent's house, one for each day that I've known and loved her. That oughta get her talking to me again.
Rach, uh, you still looking for a place?
No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie.
Hey! What's she doing back here?
Umm-hmm.
Mm-hmm..
Yes. I find it to be something of a conversation piece.
Can't we just use a pen?
Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the Paleontology section? See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.
How'd the callback go?
No Phoebe, don't look! You don't want to see what's under there!!
...Chandler!
Like what?
Uh Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. We're not 13 anymore.
The routine!
I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.
Am I?! And was it your idea to postpone the wedding?!
Hey!
You do, huh?
Yeah. Look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her.
Wait! It was my plan.
Dude! How-how did you write this?
Hero, I uh, I don't know-well, all right.
Okay, I...
Dude!
Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.
Alright, now, you sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they didn't look happy...
Wow. Umm... Huh... I'm-I'm not sure what to do with that right now.
Yeah, well it came to about $112, but what the hell, just call it an even 110?
Uh-ha, what about someone who looks like Rachel? I will think about the therapy.
Oh, here, I, I'll get it for ya. Whad'ya want?
Oh, come here sweetie, listen, you're gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job. That's not how that was supposed to come out.
Umm, your boxes are umm...
Y'know I remember when uh, when I was in college, we used to...
Fighting?!
Yeah!
Come on, don't do this.
In the death seat?!!
No.
The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.
Well y'know 'cause Rachel and I used to go out.
Oh yeah, why not?
What difference does that make?!
Funny story!
You still love me?
Or! Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at the source.
Because I am bored...Out of my mind. I've already been to the bank, post office, and the dry cleaners.
Oh!
Yes. And another time after that. Boy I'm getting hungry! Hey Joey, have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you eat some of her food?
What are you doing?
Oh, be-because of the leather pants.
Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child.
Uh Mr. Morse, can I speak to you for a moment?
Not the first two, but the second two- woooo! ...I love you guys. You guys are the greatest. I love my sister , I love Pheebs...
Oh.
No, I've looked everywhere!
Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending this time with me. It's been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say thanks.
... and that's the story of the dreidle. Now, some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising life's triumph over death. And that was like 4000 years ago.
Oh, come on you guys; that's funny! Y'know? Because he's need-he's got like a hearing aide y'know, 'cause-'cause y'know, 'cause he's all old, and...
Step back.
Great, actually. I'm thinking tonight, maybe the night. Yeah, I mean ah, the kids are gonna play together and then when they're asleep, I'm thinking Amanda and I break open a bottle of wine, and do a little "playing" ourselves.
Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?
You comin'?
Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?
How is that important?
I... I do, I do not love Rachel. I'm gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay? Would I do that if I loved her?
Look, I didn't think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I thought we were broken up.
Yeah, but I got cous-cous!
Thanks Rach.
Yes, yes I am, one of the many things I'm feeling. Well....
Hey, both you guys should be up there with me. I mean, you two are-are my... I mean, I'm lucky to have just one good...
You really serve people sneezers?
Cookies and porn, you're the best mom ever!!
Bumpy?
Well, you should've seen the guy that she used to go out with. I mean, he's like Joe Rugby.
How could you tell her?!
You kissed her.
Hey, hello! mmwa! I brought all the books, and Monica sends her love, along with this lasagna.
C'mon! C'mon!
Oh, I don't know how that got in there.
Now that's a little spoiled. He was supposed to type "little", the idiot.
Hey Rach.
Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh.
That's a good point.
Sure! Here.
That's great! Are you happy now? Look what you did with your funny, funny form!
Why?! Are there like bears or something?! Ohh. Oh, protection. Yeah-no, yeah-no, that-that-that I forgot.
What?!
Go, go, go!
The guy who took Rachel to the prom? Why is he calling you?
Ohhhh
Thanks. I-I think I'm dying. I really do.
What?
Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever can't do it. Listen, uh- gimme back my puck.
Looks like a fun gang.
DANGER!!! DANGER!!!!!
I don't know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then.
Look you're my wife. We're-we're married. Y'know? I-I love you. I-I really miss you.
Umm, it's Cutie McPretty.
Rachel! Well, you-you're not at home, you're-you're-you're right here.
Dad, we-we can't believe you're selling the house.
All right, maybe it means that too...
Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! Okay.
Ah y'know, this building is on my paper route so I...
What?
If you wanna put a label on it.
Was your basket on top?
No, I-I'm saying I liked her.
I know if you were getting married I'd feel, kinda..... y'know.
Hey, let's bring the rest of these down to the truck.
Oh damn!
Oh come on! Here we go! Stand by for mission countdown!
Oh! So-so seriously, what time?
What, so this guy is helping you for no apparent reason?
Yeah. Ya know, a boy and a girl. Hopefully the girl will come first so Ben here won't feel too competitive.
Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket!
Maybe that will liven up this party.
Cool.
What is it?
Y'know, hey! You're the one who ended it, remember?
Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there's a bug in my food.
Joey come-I can't believe-I bring you here to see the Bapstein-King comet, one of nature's most spectacular phenomenon, and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman!
Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something.
Umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great. 'Cause you know love lasts forever, y'know. Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so Rachel and I broke up.
Rings?
Found it.
How did you know about that?!
What? It's, it's just a phase.
Ohh, these are pretty good.
Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too much, way, way, too much, it's a sickness really.
Come on Rach, you don't have what, ten minutes?
I can't believe this is happening.
No you're not.
Actually, it looks really good.
Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked to Emily...
Marcel, Marcel, give Rossie the remote. Marcel. Marcel, you give Rossie the remote right now... Marce... you give Rossie the remote...
Oh, see I-I don't know if we're gonna be hungry at three.
No-no, he's, he's very docile.
No! Okay! Okay! Okay, look, can I, can I just-just talk to you for a second?
Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.
It was ridiculous. Ya know, these guys, they were bullies, actual bullies, ya know. We're grown ups, this kinda stuff isn't supposed to happen anymore.
Dude! That's my sister!
Oh, no, I didn't mean, uh...
G-gift? The thing's not the gift?
Nothing. Oh, actually, great news! I just got off the phone with Emily and it looks like I'm moving to a new apartment. Woo-hoo!
Cassie?
Okay, Jasmine, please, please don't. I love my girlfriend very much, and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?
Come on!
Congratulations.
Little girl misses her cat. Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat. Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her.
Uh, hello!
Okay, have fun! Wooo!!
College?
Wh-what did he say?!
Ah... Ah...Get out of here! Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marion's views on evolution?
What?
No, I will not!
Whew! That was a brisk ride!
Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue.
Oh great! That means I'm stuck with, "So, we were watching you in there and you were sittin' right here! Whoa!"
Yeah! Yeah, Emily always wanted to get married in this beautiful place that her parents got married, but it's going to be torn down, so... I mean, I-I know it's crazy, but everything up 'til now has been so crazy, and I don't know, this just feels right. Y'know?
Oh-ho, whoa! Sorry, Tommy. I almost spilled this hot coffee on you.
Marcel, c'mere, c'mere. Well buddy, this is it. There's just a coupla things I want to say. I'm really gonna miss you, and I'm never gonna forget about you. You've been more than just a pet to me, you've been more like a be- Okay, Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! Marcel, would- okay, just take him away. Just take him.
Rachel!! Wow! You, uh, you look, wow!
I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?
FINE BY ME!!
Can't wait.
It was totally flirting. "Somebody got a haircut "
Yeah, pants, what, what an idea. Or better yet, um, how 'bout you go without any pants. Look, I don't know what you're trying to do to me, but just get your butt in there and pick out any shoes that fit your feet, okay. No, no I don't care if they match. I don't care if they make your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat. Okay.
Oh, Carol and I have a new system. If she punches in 911, it means she's having a baby, otherwise I just ignore it.
Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens.
Bye sweetie.
Yeah.
No.
Pretty soon I guess.
Oohh, 23. Which is what we play to at this casino! You win 10 dollars!
You bug me.
What? No! Of course, of course I do! Are-are they gone?
Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me?
Thank you guys-guys-guys...
No, you don't.
No, its...Its not that. Umm, now what I'm going to say to you, I'm not saying as your friend. Okay? I'm-I'm saying as it as Monica's older brother.
Hey Rach, can I talk to you outside for a second?
This is my wedding.
I picked up the divorce papers. Uh, I've already signed everything and I put little 'X's where you need to sign.
Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still haven't gotten it.
It's not like we don't know how to party!!
Well then, what is it?!
Yeah, I still don't know. I'm sorry I just wanna make sure that I bought the right couch. I need a couch that says, "Kids welcome here." But that also says, "Come here to me!"
Damn!
Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.
That bitch!
You were in a porno?
I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.
Doorknob! Doorknob!
Yeah. What do you think.
Not hating Yanni is not a real reason.
I think just the annulment for today.
I'll make some calls.
Chandler-
Jill, how did you pay for all this? I thought your dad took away your credit card.
No, hey-hey, come on, Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay? Hey, you're-you're his favorite little guy!
Woah.
Maybe I'll take her to that new French restaurant down the street...
Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?
Dollars? You spent $1200 dollars on a plastic bird?
I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.
Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even look like now.
Is this?!
Hey!
Oh, all right. Tails! Can you-can you see what it is?
Okay.
I don't know. Soap?
No!!
Hi.
Well, okay, what-what did she say?
Ugh, museum.
I uh, I don't know, I guess I'm just gonna see, see what happens.
OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.
Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...
Man, look at all those stars! Infinite space. It really, really makes you wonder, doesn't it?
We said it was only going to be two weeks, y'know?
Y'know what? I think we've seen enough, let's turn it off.
Oh yeah!
Just a sandwich. Turkey, a little mustard...
I find Marion's views far to progressionist.
Thanks, man, big help.
Hey!
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. Sorry. Sorry! Hey! Hey! I got my s's back! Which we can celebrate later. Celebrate.
OK. OK, this is a picture frame from Ben to my parents, huh.
Chandler's gone again!
It hurts my teeth.
You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
Hi! Hi, I'm Ross, you don't know me, but I'm a big, big fan of yours. I mean, Blue Velvet, woo-oo hoo! Um, I was wondering if I could um, maybe buy you a cup of coffee? Or maybe reimburse you for that one?
Hop in. Get ready for the smoothest ride of your life.
Got it!
You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
Uh, never mind, I don't want to know.
Hey, how are you holding up?
Please don't say naked chicks.
I cannot believe we're having this conversation.
Well, you need something to make this day special? Hello! You-you-you have the most special thing of all! You are marrying the woman you love.
Oh. Hel-lo!
That's okay. She's still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, it's too late to do any of the things I had planned, so...
Hey-hey, or I could bring my keyboard over here sometime!
...Gets interrupted. Hi!
Phoebe, you can't get out of this! Okay? You have to learn how to ride a bike!
Ok, got the vent open.
Okay, that's a fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
Um, that is because my doctor says that I have a very serious.... nuget.... diffency.
Oh really. Is that how you felt when you turned thirty?
What? You forgot fourteen states?
I can't believe they-they didn't even tell us!
Oh my God. Ohh, my little sister and my best friend...shaking up. Oh, that's great. That's great.
Oh no-no-no!
China.
Well she should, it was taken ten years ago!
No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please-
No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me?
Eww.
Hi!
That'd be good...
I'm sorry. See that's the good thing about my job. All the dinosaurs on my table are already dead.
I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?
You still love me?
I made a man twice my size cry. I mean, I haven't done that since I was four and I washed my dad's Porsche with rocks.
Hey Phoebe!
Relax, I'll fix it.
Hello.
I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...
Oh Donald that-that would be great. I am totally ready to come back to work. I-What? No! Wh... What are you doing?!! GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You hated me when we were kids?
Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.
It wasn't the best.
Hey.
Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh, by the by, did it uh, did it ever occur to you that, I don't know, maybe they might be having a little too much fun?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got to get to the museum. So um, I'll see you tonight.
Aww, is it broken?
Bummer.
You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?
No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one.
So it's looks like we're the first ones here.
Okay. I did divert her and we ended up having a great time! Okay?
Well how much time before she absolutely has to start getting ready?
That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him.
Ohio!! Thank you!
Bunny!
See there, you uhh, alright, ya, you did what I said.
Hey!
Yeah!!
Hey!
I wanna get out of the room! Y'know, I...I really miss downstairs.
Well ah, you wanna just stay out there?
You'd wait?
I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps.
My God!
Isn't Rachel supposed to be back by now?
What?! What?! Talking about what?!
ON A CAT??!!!!
Pregnant?!
Emotional hell. So, did they lend you the money yet?
Hey. When you guys were kids and you played Happy Days, who were you? I was always Richie.
Rach, come on, if you think about it, it's actually kinda funny. Okay, maybe it's best not to think about it.
Uh yeah! Let me, let me get that for you.
Okay, I'm sorry, this is insane! I-I-I'm not addicted to heroin, I'm not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything! Look, I'll consummate this marriage right here, right now!
Bec-Did you not hear me?! She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department, okay? They're wild! Why do you want to come anyway?
Yeah, they don't like you.
No. Man I don't wanna have to have Joey with me every time I wanna descent cup of coffee. Ya know, and I don't wanna spend the rest of my life drinking cappucino with a 'K'. I say you and I go back down there and stand up to those guys.
Why- why- why would he need a blade?
Is there somebody else?
Are you serious?!
Yeah.
Aww, Pheeb, come on isn't there any relative that would have the recipe? What about, what about your sister?
I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.
No, a car backfired, but I thought somebody was taking a shot at me. And Rach, I...I survived! And I was filled with this-this great respect for life. Y'know? I-I want to experience every moment. I want to seize every opportunity. I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now.
That's romantic.
Hey, divorced men are not bad men!
Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this.
What is this?!
Pretty please? Not very uh, 007.
No, but, but I wanna be with you in spite of all those things.
Hello. Hi sweetie. Good. Look umm, yes I've been thinking about that thing that you wanted me to do and, I can do it. So will you come to New York?
Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the Happy Days gang.
And; people thinking it's huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder. Which we are not!
Did you tell your sister to ask me out?
You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?
Come on out, honey! I'm telling you look good! Tell her she looks good, tell her she looks good.
Oh I a lot of stuff!
Thanks, Dad, really, I ju... you know, I just, I just needed to know, um... when did you start to feel like a father?
What's-what's going on?
Look, Rachel, this is poker. I play to win, alright? In order for me to win, other people have to lose. So if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to be a 'nice guy,' OK? Cause once those cards are dealt...
Right, they are scary. Ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand!!!
Okay, but do you really need another friend? I mean...
Oh, I-I don't know, it's kind of expensive for a studio.
Pass it! Pass it!
Hey!
Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn't work.
It's my joke.
See ya!
Joey! The vet said it's a simple procedure.
Well, can you blame her?
We'd like to close our accounts.
Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.
No, Rach!
Come on, man! Just-just take the sweats off. Okay? Just take 'em off and we'll have some fun.
...and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should've just lasted just one day, burned for...
The test is ready.
Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck.
I dunno, maybe it's because you're really sarcastic. Or maybe it's cause you uh-
Hey, could you do me a favour? Could you just grab me a bottle of water?
Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.
That! Let's talk about that.
I, I know it's big, I just didn't know it was uh, ha-ha big.
Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on.
Only way to fly.
Ok, well, if you do take him out for his walk, you might wanna bring his hat, and there's extra milk in the fridge, and there's extra diapers in the bag.
I'm tellin' you. You can't do this.
Getting married. Okay. Okay. You can, you can do that too! Just like you've done everything else!
No, come on, he doesnt know this stuff. If he knew how you felt.
Maybe it was both of us, but we had our best friend's interest... But we had our best friend's interest at heart.
Thanks. I know you guys like to give me a hard time and all, but it really means a lot to me that you like her. Just knowing that you guys are...
You-you-you-you threw my sandwich away!
Well, of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming, that's not enough. Look, I studying kara-tay for a long time, and there's a concept you should really be familiar with. It's what the Japanese call unagi.
You really didn't know?
Do you like it?
Hey!
Hey, what's going on?
Perhaps. Now I'm curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to kick my ass?
What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean, back to Jordie? We never landed on Jordie. We just passed by it during the whole Jessy, Cody, Dylan fiasco.
I knew you were gonna throw that in my face!! That was three years ago! She apologized and she apologized! What more do you want?!!
The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game.
Chandler!!! Chandler!!! Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!
Hey Rach, can you pass me the TV Guide?
Well, if what's in the bottle is actually 30. I mean sometimes you get 30, sometimes it's-it's get 4, and I swear to God more often than not it's just milk.
Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm.
Yeah, well.
The actress!
I'm sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.
Well maybe he'll get to go soon, like on a class trip or something.
Emily.
Joey!
All right!!
Sorry I ah, I scared you in there.
Listen, Roland Chang, if things go well, I'm gonna be out with her all night.
I don't know.
Okay, I'm going to start climb down you now.
To be fair, he doesn't seem to be impersonating Fonzie...
No way.
Slides are almost ready.
It's ridiculous!
What's up with the greed Joe?
What?
Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there.
Hey.
There he is!!
I just wanna say good-bye to you guys and to see if you guys will place a little bet for me, huh? Twenty bucks on black 15.
Look, we're just friends now! Okay? Why would I do anything stupid?
You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know we haven't actually met...
OK. Hold my board.
Oh, oh, we did say we'd stop by this little thing Joey's roommate is having.
No.
Well, you just...
I know.
Okay, can we just sign please?
So why don't you quit?
It was my first time.
There you go. Thank you!
Ok, Mom never hit.
OK. I'm in my apartment...
He looks so tiny.
Noo. Why?
This is helping your career?! Huh? I thought you wanted to be an actor not the creator of crazy lawsuit game!
Eh?
That's, that's Julie. Ju... Julie, Julie. Hi Julie.
No!
What the hell was that?!
Kinda... spooky without any lights.
You're right!
Yeah, y'know what? I'll take it myself, thank you! All right Rach, let's go!
Yeah, yeah, what is it?
Yes, hello. I have a question. Umm, I used your pen to draw on my friend's face. A beard and a moustache. Thank you. No, she didn't think so. I know it's like anyway, umm well make-up didn't cover it and we've tried everything to get it off and nothing's worked. What-what do we do? Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. Oh! Okay. Okay, thank you! Yeah, it's not coming off.
Ohhh.
Yes. Yes! Please, come in.
What? Why not?
What do you mean?
Y'know, I think they have those at that British pub near the trade center.
No.
I don't care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!
Yeah, no one talks like that!
Uh-oh, saved by the bell. Hello?
Gunther have you uh, have you seen Chandler?
I've no idea, could be. Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight.
Yes.
Oh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort of happen around you. I mean, you're off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totally oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings...
Yeah!
Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three. Well you didn't hang up either.
Why are we in bed together?
What's up?
They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.
Hi.
So I'm going over to Amanda's tonight!
Do you have a point?
Oh no, I have plans with Elizabeth.
Oh.
I don't believe this. I miss, I miss the first time of everything. I missed, what, the first time he rolled over, the first time he crawled. What else did I miss? Has he spoken yet, is he driving, does he have a favorite liquour?
Who's your roommate?
I'm so proud of you.
Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes.
Can we, can we just forget this ever happened?
No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would've just stepped aside.
You are, you're welling up.
Oh, okay, y'know what this is? This is a difference of opinion. And when that happens in a marriage...
I know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though Nana's gone there's, there's something almost, uh- I dunno, almost life-aff-
Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?
I'm sorry your husband cheated on you.
No, that's fine.
Oh, you have to call the police! That's what I did to the kids in my building!
All right. All right, I'll do it.
What am I doing?
You complete me kitchen, matey!
Ooohhhh!!
Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra.
All right! All right! Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-a-like contest and won!
I'm giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night, I think you should come.
Hi! Hi! Hi. Has umm, anyone seen Chandler?
Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you...
Don't you realise none of this would've ever happened if I didn't think at that same moment you weren't having sex with Mark?
Yes. Yes. Don't worry. Everything's fine. We'll uh, we'll see you tomorrow at the wedding.
Hello.
Honey, I love you too.
Thanks for letting me tag along tonight you guys.
Yes, yes, that's right...
Ohh, you can see them, huh?
Good for a scrud.
Wait uh, listen. I-I, I have to tell you something. Umm, I've been thinking, I'm just gonna come out and say it. Okay? I-I-I ah, I-I think I love you.
Why, why, why can't you stand me being here? I don't, I, we're just, ya know, we're just havin' fun.
Uh, I'm sorry, you don't understand, I'm, I'm, I'm a friend of his. We uh, we used to live together.
Ok, ok, here we go. Ok, where am I talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but...
What? What? Was that a joke? 'Cause it's mean.
Whaddya got there?
I am, uh, I am...
Good, 'cause I love you.
...and these come in the shapes of your favourite Christmas characters, Santa, Rudolph, and Baby Jesus.
'The hills were alive with the sound of music.'
All righty roo. What a great moment to say that for the first time.
Oh, yeah, no problems. It's all taken care of.
Mine.
I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice. I'm the one who's making things change, so I should be the one to y'know, step back.
I don't know, umm...
I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten.
Okay.
Um, you know, just out of curiosity...
Hmm, a lot of this stuff is from Colonial times. Hey, what are some other time periods Rachel?
I'm getting married today!! Ahh, whoo-hoo!!
What are you guys doing?
Ohhh.
It's-it's hot...
Did you get Monica's authorization to move all of her stuff?
Huh. This is nice.
'My scones.'
What's goin' on?
Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done.
Wha-, you have a phone in here?
Hi Pheebs!
Oh, she isn't home.
We-we-we-I remember being in a chapel.
She is a kook.
You do Pheebs?
Mine stole my newspaper! It's like a crime wave!! Pheebs, you uh, you got a second.
Or that.
Hiiiiii.
Thanks. You ready to go?
Rach, what uh, what are you doing here?
Thank you.
Well, I don't know.... huh-huh.... but I'm hoping huh-huh.
Monica did it?
I'm telling you, this guy Rachel is with is crazy! Okay? He viscously screamed at total strangers! I think he's baaad news!
Oh, it's not the ideal way...
Okay, fine, fine. You don't want to believe me? No, that's fine.
I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.
It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?
Well, I do! Why don't we go back to my place, light a couple of candles, break open a box of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties, uh...
Oh, thanks, thanks. So Monica tells me that uh, you don't want to play anymore because me and y'know my talent. Is that true?
Look, I-I drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it. Okay Rach, that's you. That's the couch.
Oh thank you.
No, no, let me finish.
No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!
That's right Lydia, Elizabeth here is a student and uh, we're dating. And you may frown upon that, but we're not gonna hide it anymore.
Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.
Beautiful!
Okay.
Hmm?
Bye-bye!
Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. How's it going. This is the hardest letter I've ever had to write. What the hell's a matter with you? How do you think Joey's going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?
Take thee, Rachel... Emily. Emily.
See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music. Y'know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I... I won't play anymore.
That's nice. Get out Let's go, come on.
Wha-What did he say that was so funny?
Open it, open in.
Wait a minute, she was walking the bike? Both times?
Hey!
Come on! Here.
Really? That okay, that's great.
Crack isn't even an intravenous drug!
I go back there with lawn ornaments, he's going to laugh in my face.
Yeah, yeah. I got a lemon schmush.
Oh well that's great, so I guess this is ah, this is good bye then. Huh? Good bye.
Hello! Hello!
Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n' Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.
I mean after tomorrow night.
What?!
I prefer not to answer that right now, I'm still carrying a little holiday weight.
Okay. Umm, for a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
Oh, Rachel, I'm-I'm sorry.
Hi!
Hey, y'know while we're on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you don't live here anymore.
That's okay, I mean it was just two-week thing anyway, I just didn't want it to end this way, y'know?
I can't believe someone would do that for a grade.
So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebe's mom remind anyone of a cat?
That-that would be incredible. Thank you so much. I-I still can't believe someone ate it!! I mean, look, I left a note and everything.
What are you, what are you doing?
You'll never get me, Joe!!!
I'm shipping out tomorrow.
Some would say she's attractive, yes.
Well, I do, so let's... So, Ben, you uh, you know what holiday is coming up, don't ya?
Ohh.
That word was swans.
Oh you do, do you?
Are you intrigued?
Thank you! That's what I keep saying.
Everything okay in there?
30 seconds on the clock. 5 questions wins the game. The lightning round begins...now! What is Joey's favorite food?
What happened?
Hey! Everyone.
I'm telling you, there's no way he's moving back.
Yeah, either that, or he has a really big cat.
Okay. All right. So let's see, let's play from the trash can, to the lightpost. Right. Two hand touch, we'll kick off.
Oh, but I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit! I've been waiting like a year for this.
Well just hold him like you'd hold a football.
Sorry. 'Cause umm, I think this will make you a little more sophisticated.
Hey!
What?
Okay, I'll see you soon buddy. Be back in an hour.
Oh really? What uh, what does he want with her?
That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross... Uh-oh.
It's the only possibility, Phoebe.
Oh, mine's December...
Mmm-Unmm.
Hi!
So I nodded off a little.
Yeah.
Good! Me neither! So it's not a problem. We're just two friends who happen to be roommates.
Oh come on, not again.
Oh, I kinda was, wasn't I?
Can you believe this? We're gonna be on the platform for the Millennium moment!
So you're strong enough to face her on your own?
We need more cards.
Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us. And so I uh, hah-hah, I just heave it down field.
Okay.
Hi!
What? What's on your shoulder?
I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.
Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as 'Laser Floyd' was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes! That's when it occurred to me, the key to my success, 'The Munchies.' So I ah, started hitting the new dorms around midnight. I am selling cookies by the case. They call me 'Cookie Dude!'
No tongue.
No!
You get the dollhouse.
I was thinking more like a hundred.
You take care Jill.
The kid...? Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck.
Okay, I'll see you later pal.
Hey, what'd you guys do to get up on there?
You don't, you don't know what your wearing?
Yeah-No-but-but-but-but! We're just gonna go home and take a shower. Now, that's not scary right?
Um, yeah.
No, I've looked everywhere!
I guess it could.
Rachel?
Yeah, huh.
Good night.
The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...
Congratu!! -lations-lations.
Monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky. I'm gonna use the phone. I gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily. My God, think of the massacre.
Okay. Thanks you guys. Pheebs are you wearing fur?
No thanks. I'm 29.
I am your friend.
Um. I know it says black tie optional, but, um this may be pushing it a little, um.
Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we didn't.
Are you OK?
I'm getting ready for the water skiing. How are you doing?
Fifteen.
Dad, you really don't want to do that.
We're not done.
Come on, Rachel, come on! Talk to me! Please!!
Okay. Cool.
Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said, 'nobody won that game, ' and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy and.... threw it in the lake.
Ah, we'll all go. Come on.
Of course not. With you it's like I've got two 25-year-olds.
I- I think they're great! I, I really do.
What? What?
Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?
Okay, I know what I have to do. I've got to go Red Ross. Y'know, Red Ross!
Yeah well, if ah, if that's the rule this weekend... No!
The flirting! Aren't you supposed to be going out with, I don't know hmm, let's say my sister?!
Well, we're all here! I guess we should get going!
No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too.
Sweetie, it's be gonna okay, all right. It's a wedding, generally people focus on the bride.
God that is the most beautiful engagement ring ever!
You tryin' to be clever? A funny lady?
Fine! Thank you for warning me. At breakfast I'll be on full alert for room painting and sex weapons.
Hi, is uh, is Carol here?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it's just a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter?
Bye, Nana.
I know, I wasn't finished. But don't worry! We're gonna go down the fire escape!!
The most amazing thing happened tonight. I thought my number was up. I had an actual near death experience!
Oh no. Dad! Dad! What... Oh God...everything's ruined! Dad, she's gonna be crushed!
Well ah, actually...
Where ya goin'?
Yeah.
I think I have an old band uniform from high school.
Well, I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing.
It's all right.
Oh yeah!
Uh, yeah, I ah, I also need two.
Yeah?
No! And somehow, we ended up with a joint checking account.
That'll be a neat trick, when you're, when you're dead!
Correct. Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl's breast?
Look, I'm sorry.
I can't believe it. Can I tell you something? I'm a little mad at him now.
Well, I tried! But when I got to my lawyer's office all I could hear was, "Three divorces. Three divorces!" Look, I just don't want my tombstone to read, Ross Gellar, Three Divorces.
What are you kidding? It's Batman's tux!!
And that wasn't fun for you?
Thank you.
Phoebe, what are you doing?
Pshhshhh!
Quack, quack..
All right, we're gonna play.
My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.
Yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. It's not just about the pictures.
You've got to help me my monkey swallowed a 'K'!
Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.
Look, I am a reasonable man. I will accept store credit.
Okay, if you'll excuse me, I-I'm gonna go hang out with some people who don't know the Space Mountain story.
I don't, I don't think we've meet. I-I'm Ross.
Hey. Oh, I'm sorry, this is Cailin.
Here you go, you can pay me back whenever you like.
Ah! Oh.
Hey!
Let me see that! Oh man!
After one class? I don't think so.
Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?
Gimme this.
Remember? You-you were eating pizza.
Hey, Rach, you know what? I think, I think I know what'll make you feel better. How 'bout you make a list about me.
What are you talking about?
Nobody likes change.
Oh, hey, hey, I got that.
Yes. Yes. Yes.
Alright, I've gotta go. C'mon, Marcel! C'mon! We're gonna go take a bath. Yes we are, aren't we? Yes, we are.
Well, I'm not going to go now anyway .
No! No! That's-that's time-out!
I have a bone to pick with you.
And that's Phoebe over there!
Okay! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think, forget about the whole three divorce thing! Okay, I-I'll go to my lawyer's office right now and get this marriage annulled! Okay?! Because she means nothing to me! Noth--Nothing!!
What?
Oh, who? Me?
Yeah y'know what? Maybe-maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you suck, maybe you messed up because you care more about uh, your godson.
Come on! That's great.
Flip me for it? No, no, no... heads, heads, heads!
So um...Thanksgiving. The holiday season is upon us, hm?
Rach...
Okay, okay. Look, you have got to go to a doctor! Okay?
I'm hurt.
Yeah, you didn't get one.
Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket!
Yeah!
Wow!
What's going on?
Wow! It actually is in the handbook. I can't date you or have a hot plate in my office. I can't believe we have to stop seeing each other.
Uh, hello dad! Monica and I just saw the house in the paper! Yes we're surprised! Who did you leave a message with?
Monica had such a crush on him. Yeah, she used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed.
Hey.
Rach, I got a message from you. Who's Michael?
Okay, y'know how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage?
No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry?
She's dating. She's dating.
Okay!
Okay, this is getting a little crazy. I mean, I'm-I'm sure it would be amazing but I...gotta say I really-really don't think it would be a good idea. Y'know? I really, really...don't.
I mean, uh, who... who cares about a little sloppiness?
Y'know what? It sounds so weird to say this but, I just had a great day with Janice!
Oh, so-so you talked to her. Did she, did she sound mad?
You were worried about me? You didn't know how I was going to react?
Thirty seconds, all the questions you can answer.
...since I stopped trying.
Well, there goes my whole belief system.
Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldn't invite her?
You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.
Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can do whatever I want!
It's an empty apartment.
No, 10 is the highest.
I, Ross...
Okay!
Ahh, whoo-hoo!!
Who?
You tell them to wait!
Oh no-no-no! Oh-no! No! No! Emily!
What? Of course I did! You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.
There was just an explosion, okay? My hearing would be impaired.
Ok, ok look, see, the thing is we're, we're not gonna fight you guys.
No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade.
Listen, I got to tell you I've-I've never been to a guru before, so...
Pheebs you uh...you do know how to ride a bike don't you?
You're nose is bleeding!
Oh, Pheebs, I'm sorry, Ive got to go. Ive got Lamaze class.
Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.
You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...
Hi! I'm sorry, but can you give me a second while I talk to this woman, who by the way did not spend the night.
Oh great! What, you brought Joey?
Call me!
No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back.
What? I can't cancel on Joan!
I'm gonna call her.
Okay, well, we'll call the company that sent her!
You're not getting away this time mister! Unless you want that ass kicking we talked about!
You called Animal Control?
No, I mean it's okay, I mean, they're-they're my friends. In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them.
Eh, 'cause I knew that if I told you, you'd make me go, and I knew you needed someone to be with you tonight. Come on. Come on.
Hey, would you ah, would you like some juice?
No, this is pretty much it.
Put it back exactly where you found it?
Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal.
You're wrong.
What's goin' on?
You don't know?! Rach, you balded my girlfriend!
I get it! Well, that's that.
Yeah.
I'll be right down.
Don't blame the questions!
Well, hello, Mrs. Ross!
No. No, I gotta go home sometime.
Wh-haa-haa! Look what 'cha did!
No, no. I mean, it mighta been at first, but by now I, I think I'm pretty comfortable with the whole situation.
I know.
He told you everything! I mean you totally cracked him!
I-I-I...
This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on.
What?
How might you be wrong?
Apparently Phoebe's mother also goes by the name Julio.
I'm gonna be on TV!!
And that should conclusively prove that I had the idea for Jurassic Park first! Now let's take a look at...
What? A-ohh! Ohh. Oh that's right that's right. That's Richard's favorite place too.
Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can't decide between the two of them. Y'know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she's a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown. Y'know she's, well she's-she's just as pretty, I guess she's smart, she's not fun.
Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a...
Hey listen man, about the stripper...
Hello? Hey Mon, how's the packing going? Ben? He's fine. Yeah, he's right-Oh my God! Get your head of your shirt there son! What? Yeah, it's a pumpkin. I'll come pack.
On account of my rage.
Now, hold on! Hold on! Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I'm gonna be at that airport and I hope that she'll be there too! Oh yeah, I said Rachel's name, but it didn't mean anything, Okay? She's-she's just a friend and that's all! That's all! Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please, promise me that you'll tell her that.
No. No. Nothing happened. I shut the drapes to uh, show her slides of my favorite fossils.
Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.
I am gonna see her again.
I'm fine! I saw a psychiatrist at work today.
We're good.
I mean my God...
Yeah.
Yeah, well my-my ex-wife and I share custody of Ben and umm, uh, and just so you know, Carol and I are on excellent terms as I'm sure you are with your wife! Oh, I'm sorry! It's unbelievable!
So listen uh, I know you and I haven't really had a chance to talk since uh, Emily and I decided to get married, and uh, I was just wondering how you were.
Oh. Uh, by the way, if it makes you feel any better. I happen to like 8-year-old boys.
When did I say that?
A what?
Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.
I'm just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y'know? I used them as mittens, I didn't want to touch a thing in that last place.
I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I hope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice. What you're-you're not mad?
Please! Are you kidding? I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody nose-I mean I-I'm not proud of it but, I really am. And it's all because of you, wonderful, amazing you.
What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?
Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid?
Phoebe he's right, that is the rule.
W-What was the one right before bananas?
So, what are you guys doing four weeks from today?
Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier, y'know-y'know for fun, and I typed mine in and guess what came up? My doctoral dissertation! It's here! Yeah, it's right-it's right down here! In the biggest library in the university!
Well because I have to work on Monday, I have a big presentation.
Fascinating.
Now, how will they know if you're ready?
And why exactly would I do that?
Whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet.
Oh, thanks, Pheebs!
No?
No, I'm good.
Oh-oh-okay, but-but I know, that even though I've been a-a complete idiot up 'til now, I mean, I mean you-you-you have to come here. You have to come here so we can work this out.
Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.
So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?
Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. Okay. I, uh, am from Long Island. I-I came to the city for college. Um, I, um, have a 5 year old son and in my spare time I like to read spy novels. But, but, let's talk more about you. Hmm.
Uh, actually mom, I think Monica thanked him for the both of us.
Amazing!
OK, what's the longest you've been in the relationship before ha, have, having the sex?
Excellent!
I'm getting married today!! Whoo-hoo!!
Well I'm sorry, I think about stuff. Ya know, I mean, you're at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders.
Okay!!
I would say that.
Oh, no, no, no, it's-it's not the lecture ah, I mind, umm....
Oh no, yeah no, that part's great!
Hmph. So what you, you tell each other everything?
Excuse me.
Oh wow! I mean, wow! I mean, I-I-I think she's cute but I-I would never have thought of going out with her, never!
Marc- oh, this is ridiculous! We've been all over the neighbourhood. He's gone, he's-he's just gone.
I got it. So hi, I'm uh, I'm Ross and this is my friend Chandler.
I don't know.
Nooooo!
What?
Excuse me?
We uh, we just cooked it up.
Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.
So were you in Nam?
Yeah.
Okay! Okay! That's it!! Parents!! Parents!! Back away!! All right, this is our wedding day! From now on everyone gets along, and if I hear one more word. NO GRANDCHILDREN! That's right!!
Who?
Well umm, y'know, I used to play.
Oh, well this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousin Nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know.
Okay, see ya later.
Oh-oh, okay, okay! If you don't mind I'm gonna the rest of my stuff, and relax, in my favourite shirt. You have a pleasant evening.
What?
So do we!! So do we!! I'm sorry you had to see that.
Hello.
Uh, before we do uh, are any of Joey's special romance magazines in there?
Yeah!
I know, why not?
Hey-hey Pheebs!
Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she'd have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy.
Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone.
Because it's weird!
Come on! Here.
All right here. Watch me execute the three 'P's of championship play. Power. Precision. and penache.
Yes, exactly!
Are you sure she's in the cat, or have you been taking your grandma's glycoma medicine again?
What?! Why?
Oh God. Y'know, botanists are such geeks.
Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night? Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!!
Okay, okay, fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yogart, or something..
Oh great! We're going out again Saturday. But I just found she's also seeing some other guy.
Hey! Hey, look! Ugly Naked Guy's back!
Hi! Sorry I'm late. Were you sleeping?
Halftime.
No.
The button, the button.
No!
The volcano?
Oh, yeah I know, I know, it's a lot of boxes, but again I really appreciate you guys letting me stay here.
Elizabeth, thank God! I was just thinking about...
Okay, I'm working on my flirting.
I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?
Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.
Oh...
Sometimes, you should come over sometime! I'll play you one of my other...
Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me.
Honey, just relax, it's gonna be fine. Hey, umm,. why don't I come down there and I'll take you out to lunch?
Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? I'm fine, I'm fine.
Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together.
Oh, thanks. Yeah, I really thought we'd be able to make it work, but uh, I guess it just wasn't meant to be.
Huh.
Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but I'm having my lunch at this table, here in the middle. I'm having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if he'll sit with me.
Did you really hear a bear?
You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys?
Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!
Come on.
Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think we'll be able to find a new place for the wedding.
Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I didn't invite him to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago?
Okay here we are Paul, Elizabeth. So I hope you guys were finding something to talk about.
OK, now, sit. OK.
Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?
I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and now it's all covered in-in... Actually, thanks!
No wait! Look, wait! Okay, you can hang up, but I'm gonna keep calling! I'm gonna, I'm gonna call everyone in England if that's what it takes to get you to talk to me!
This isn't what I ordered! Man! Can anything go right in my life?! First my marriage falls apart and then...
Okay.
