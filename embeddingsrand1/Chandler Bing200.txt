Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.
What are you doing tonight?
Fine, I'll give the suit back.
Hey!!!
Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
Dude! That's my girlfriend!
You mean this.
Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.
Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother's not going to punch me. Are ya?
Joey? Got you a Joey Special, two pizzas! Joe? Hello? Damnit! Hello? No, Joey's not here right now, but I can take a message I think. He's still got a chance for the part?! Oh, that's great news! Well no obviously not for the actor who was mauled by his dog. Oh well, that's great. I will give Joey the message. Thank you! Yes! Okay, Mac audition at 2:00. Allergy actor attacked. By dog not flowers.
Nothing, except tell you, uh, I think it's wonderful how much energy you have.
What?
In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
It's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway. Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday?
Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?
Hey!
Those were like the best seats ever.
What?!
Hey!
Really.
What, no, "Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?"
I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.
Maybe he's calling to say your obsessive and crazy.
Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her.
Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very aware of my tongue...
Nice!
Y'think?
Oh yeah? Well, how'd she take it?
Okay, look, I'm gonna have to ask you all to leave.
Oh no, now it's not gonna make any sense!
Ross, just for my own piece of mind, you're not married to anymore of us are ya?
What?!
Hi...dad.
Tuna or egg salad? Decide!
Yeah, I remember.
Alright, I hope you realize you're not getting these underpants back.
Who said anything about Christmas?
She was kidding.
Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey.
Wow, I don't know what to say. Wow, I, I don't know what to say.
Which smells delicious!
Ahhhhh!
Nothing!
Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.
Well.... it is amouz-ing...
Eddie, I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend.
I said art lover.
Oh yeah, that sounds great. Oh, and listen, it's, it's gonna be....
Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.
Excuse, I seem to have dropped my ball.
Hi!
I'll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.
Where did you hear it from before?
It's your mommy. It's your mommy.
Hey!
Oh.
What?! What-what is it?!
Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game! Last night!
Op, y'know what though, it's kind've a girlie briefcase.
Well, you couldn't have looked everywhere or else you would've found her!
Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... ...now I wish I was dead.
Ohhhhh!
Well, you could also give back the money you owe me.
Pudo aver sido General Tso!
Hey, hey, those guys are takin our stuff!
Yeah?
Why is that so funny?
'Kay.
Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?
Dog grooming huh? Okay, just don't make my tail too poofy.
Eeeshk.
Thanks for trying. Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!
You okay?
Ok, that's me.
Too?
All right! That's fine! That's fine! I won't bring over the chairs! I won't bring anything over! I wouldn't want to ruin the ambiance over here at Grandma's place!!
So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve's doctor's name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, 'Doctor Monkey?' And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up.
That's right.
Well where... Where did she go?
Oh, I am no women, but that is one tasty dish.
Oh, well give me the phone then.
Yes indeedy! With a beautiful view of...
What?!
Hey!
Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?
I am so, so, so, so sorry!
Okay. You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!
Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!
Expect it in 4-6 weeks. Umm, hey, umm, Joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves.
Op, foot in a puddle, foot all in a puddle.
Yes, yes I am. Err, listen, the reason that I called you in here today was, err... please dont hate me.
Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?
Yeah, that's her.
What do we use to split it?
Yeah, let's just forget it.
Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.
Y'know what? I have been trying to apologize to him all week! If he's not gonna let me do it on the phone, I'm gonna go down there and do it in person.
Yeah, come on, it's Ross and Rachel, they've got too.
It's my joke.
Night-night.....Janice. 'Look at all that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there. That would be weird though. Okay, hug and roll time. I'm huggin', I'm huggin', your rollin', and....yes! Freedom! Except for this arm! I'm stuck. Stuck arm! Okay, time for the old table cloth trick, one fluid motion. Quick like a cat, quick like a cat! And 1...2...3!'
Oh, come on, there's a rest stop right up there! Come on, I really have to goooooooooo.
Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.
Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!
Batman has the Batmobile!
Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer. See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.
Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?
Hey Jo. When'd you start usin' mousse in your hair?
Umm, yeah.
Those are my gifts, I got them for you.
You don't even have a car!
Oh. Oh, God!
Hey, man. What's up?
Ross, a sports car? Wouldn't it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?
Susie Moss, right, yeah, wow, you look. . . great job growing up.
Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.
It was working until you showed up, you big tree! I mean, this isn't fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other! And this is all just been one stupid mistake! I was gonna propose tonight.
There we go little fella.
Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that I'm sorry. Y'know? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely understand why you were so upset.
And thats the Chrysler Building right there.
You did.
Joey you broke my chair!!
Okay well, this side looks bigger. Uh... There's more crust on this side. Y'know? So, maybe if I measured...
I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
Really?!
Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.
Ohhh!
Yes!
You're shooting with Althea?!
I'll teach ya! Come on, come on, it's really easy and really, really fun.
It's not all juice!
Well, I'm going to kill you.
If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?
Shut-out!!
It's okay, I want this to be your night too. To Monica.
Oh, how well you know me...
No?
Okay. Then I guess it's just, wait here then. Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.
Wherever! I've got like 20!
Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that's what we're gonna do.
Yeah all right, so we'll hang out.
I can't talk to you now, I gotta find Monica!
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the... OK, OK, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table.
Oh-ho-ho, I don't think so!
What does it say?!
I don't know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office.
Oh, I don't know.
Y'know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren't they?
No! No! No!
Huh! Where is the dog?!
Because of the weekend, we had a fight.
He had sex with Mr. Girabaldi!
Because I'm very happy for him! And you, you lucky dog!
BEND OVER?!!!
I'd like to toast, Ross and Emily. Of course, my big toast will be tomorrow at the wedding, so this is kind of my little toast or Melba toast, if you will. Okay. I known Ross for a long time. In fact, I knew him when he was going out with his first girlfriend. And I thought things were going to work out for him.. Until the day he over inflated her. Ohh, Dear God..
Chandler.
Well, she looks the exact opposite of that.
Look at us, we're a couple of couples!
Hey, look at this. "My Big Book of Grievances."
You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?
Was his question what's more boring than him?
I can't believe I ruined this.
Yeah, I'm sorry man.
Thanks.
Okay, I'm a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.
Nope, not under here!
You think we're ready for something like that?
Are you kidding? Okay, I'll give you a hint; I'll give you a hint.
Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special. Y'know, technically we still are over international waters.
Hey!
And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.
No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?
Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!
Oh great, food with hair on it.
I'm the ruptured spleen.
Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.
The man's got a point.
Marcel?!
Bye, Pheebs!
Well, ye, yes, actually, but, uh, they were my Aunt Edna's, and there were three of us in there.
Yes. Okay, there's this one guy, Patrick, I think you're gonna like him, he's really nice, he's funny, he's a swimmer.
Why don't you open with a joke?
Yeah.
Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together.
Hey.
Wha-
Oh, so you're going with the teacher, huh?
No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
And a date with a man!
Okay, so Richard, Richard!
Well you don't have to sound so surprised.
I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?! I'm right. I'm right. Am I right?
It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything.
Call.
Rach, Rach, we gotta settle.
See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. Me.
And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place....
No.
No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.
Wh-wh-why, wh-why, why, why was there kissing!? There should be no kissing!!
