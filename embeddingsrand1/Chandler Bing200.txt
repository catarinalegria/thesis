Yes!
Oh look, it's the woman we ordered.
Scotch on the rocks, with a twist, on a coaster? Ha-ha, Monica! Monica!
Bob here.
What?
Well, y'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up to an even hundred.
Listen, I just wanted to apologize about this afternoon and the whole massage thing. Y'know? I-I really like 'em.
Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.
Sorry, my my thing was in there with me.
I got the time to get to know Julie.
Okay, but this is the last time. With a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there. Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick--chickeeeen.
Yeah, but I bet it works.
Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-
What is going on here?
Oh, okay, time's up!
Yeah. Thanks for making me do this.
I can't believe I ruined this.
Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
Which I may say, right now, is out of control.
Well, I have a girlfriend, I'm-I'm happy. So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.
And I'll be using his dead body as a shield.
Young! You're a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybody's ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!
Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
99...100! Ready or not, here I come! All right, let's go over the concept one more time.
Richard! No one supposed to know about us! See I, did it again.
'Cause it's-it's not his last name.
Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! The Blowfish!
Tell me what?
Well yeah, but then...
There was no fish when she dropped it off.
Monica...
Yeah, I think it is!
Thank you, sir.
That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.
You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection. 'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no, no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself.
Y'know, I knew something like this was going to happen.
All right, should we just, should we just get married? Y'know? I mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it.
Well the duck can swim.
That's a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.
And Milton Berle has a...
Listen to me!!
OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on that. Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a hundred times, I promise I will never take it off my. . . wrist. But if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just uh, you stay in there.
Look out kids, he's coming!
No, no, you got zero points for 'IDNEY'.
Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack.
Happy New Year!
Well, your kind of sitting in my seat.
Oh, so you're already doing your part for the kids.
Noho. Who doesn't they like me?
You know what's weird. Donald Duck never wore pants. But whenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. I mean, what is that about?
Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get.
Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000.
Oh okay, I'll-I'll try.
One more game?
So-If you wear that you'll make mine less special.
So...
So I got ya something.
I love you too.
I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.
No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when Snoopy falls. . . funny.
Well, it is overdue.
Op, y'know what though, it's kind've a girlie briefcase.
Goodnight.
Yes I'm gonna put it back exactly where I found it.
Yes! Ross, you have to stay!
Monica and I are engaged.
Hi! Hi. Okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store, the ring you're about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. So, I'm gonna need to have that back. But, in exchange I'm willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring. Ew.
Three!
And I think Ross is generous too.
Hey Mon, how's it going?
They do?
So, what do you think?
Joey!
Oh, come on! I don't care! Come on! Whose is it?
But are you sure you can do this?
No you don't-get it in black, not brown.
You did.
I said, "Like what?"
Hey.
It's your timer.
I hope she throws up on you.
...And what did you bring?
What does she do?
Sorry.
Should we call the spitter?
Oh, I am no women, but that is one tasty dish.
I don't know.
Hey.
You ready?
I see. Y'know umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies.
Thanks.
We were playing poker, alright...
It's true.
Yeah, he's really excited about it too, he even recorded show times on his answering machine.
Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you.
You dove in front of Ross! Ross!
Hey!
Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen.
To Put the Camera Away!!!
Here you go Phoebe! Here you go Phobo! Phewbedo! Phaybobo.
Okay. "So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"
Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.
Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was funny, just not "Archie Comic funny."
Takin' that with you, huh?
What?!
They do me?
Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.
Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he'll be there. And he'll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that you're really hot.
I know you probably don't want to go out with me, y'know because I make too many jokes and I've never been in a serious relationship and I guess I'm not technically a "doctor..."
Because the kids need new shoes.
No, we're still together. Yeah we went out for two summers, and then I broke up with her.
It happened in London.
Hi.
Oh uh, o, OK.
Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.
What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesn't matter, I still wind up with this little cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. It's so annoying. Does it bug you?
I'm tellin' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain.
Eh?
Op, op, I'm convinced!
Yeah?
Not once!
You're right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right, Coach Ruben. Do you know what Pheebs? When you're done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too.
We'll watch him.
Oh-ho, come here. Listen, you are one of my favourite people and the most beautiful woman I've ever known in real life.
Well, only if you order stuff.
What?
Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname?
Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first!
Why must everybody watch me sleep? There'll be no more watching me sleep, no more watching.
I know, I can do this.
What are you doing tonight?
Hey!
Okay, one...two...
I know, I know, but you're gonna have plenty of chances. There are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over.
Yeah?
Too dry.
That's laughter.
Okay. Okay.
See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. Me.
She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!
Me?! Why me?
Ohhh Oh no, wait a minute, I have no one.
Hey.
By me?
Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that's what we're gonna do.
I want to. I love her so much, but I'm afr...It's too huge.
Joey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey!
Oh! Oh! That's so hard.
Hey.
Oh, come on! It's not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually I'm pretty much just in there by myself.
Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!
Uhl..ell. By the way, in case you missed that, that sound was, "Uhl, ell."
So--You got in voluntarily?!
Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? I'm going to go over to Joey's.
Well, I've got a girl in here.
I got it! Scotch... tape.
Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I get to have sex with the star of the play!
It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out.
So it did go well.
I got caught up and work, but I'm quitting tomorrow.
Sorry Phoebe.
Sure! That's one of the great things about being engaged. I'm not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore.
Wh-wh-why?!
Okay. You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!
Hiya doin' pumpkin?
No, no he went for a walk.
Yes, Janice. Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?
Hello!
Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?
All this lying has been hard on us too.
No we didn't!
Yeah.
Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.
Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!
Would you put that back on?! Monica's gonna be here any minute!
That was like 5 years ago.
Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?
Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.
Can I just say one thing?
Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?
I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?! I'm right. I'm right. Am I right?
Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!
Uhh, that was Joey. He's running a little late, he says he's sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!
Okay and he hasn't proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.
No, that was Dana Caplin.
You mind if I...
Woah, woah, I've put on a little weight?
Yeah! You?
Are you looking at naked tribe's women?
All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down. What?
Well, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still be living with him.
'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this.
You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!
See, I told you they don't swim.
You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?
Hey.
Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn't come yet.
