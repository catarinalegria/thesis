Or not.
Yes, but you are dead inside.
Well good, here let me help you out.
If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift.
No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this.
How does she do that?
You wanna get out of my face?
Y'know what? I-I think that umm, I don't feel like going to The Plaza.
So how does it look?
Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby!
Do you want to go out on a date with her?
Watch the thorns!
Thanks. Like, check out my new catering stuff. Look at this! I'm an omelet station! Omelet? Made to order!
I know! I'll tell you something, we are gonna do that again!
Hey Pheebs, how's it going?
Oh, you look so great.
It was okay. She's still kind of depressed because she broke up with her boyfriend.
Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are we celebrating?
Thanks.
Wow!
So, we did okay at the strip club, right?
Well, we certainly are alone.
This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids?
Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here's the thing, for the last two weeks I have umm, tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere...
Alright, I tell you what, I'll give this to you now if you can tell me where we keep the dustpan.
Now are drawers will smell nice and we didn't waste these pantyhose.
Quick, Phoebe, tell us before he can swallow.
Really!
Look at you, you won't even look at him.
The ones we had right after you almost threw up.
What?!
Ohh.
Yeah. It's my dad's birthday, I decided to give him a stroke.
Oh my God! I love him!
Um, you guys, you know when I said before, "thank you, but I don't really need your help"?
Honey, that's a great idea nailing the boxes to the floor!
I'm just saying, if we put just a little bit of makeup on you.
Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.
Who?
When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out.
Joey, you're this guy's teacher. I mean how could you do this?
Unless...
I know, it's great!
Great!
Yes!
I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.
What-what's going on?
Ugh! Well, y'know, we were away...
I don't know.
That's fine.
Well, he told me he was going out with the guys, I just didn't know that you were the guys.
Really?
Yes there is! He's black and white and shaggy and he's sitting next to Rachel and licking Rachel's hand.
Wow! Your lip went bald. Hey, thanks.
What?!
It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. I know it's a little sudden, and it's a little rushed, and it's totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn't mean I can't. Right? I mean I'm-I'm crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.
So you had fun, huh?
Umm, when I said that uh, that Chandler and I wanted to umm, live together we meant alone together.
Why don't you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean that's what I did when I first weighing stuff.
Well what did you send?
You flicked me first.
Okay.
Hi, nice to meet you!
Just go over and say hi.
We didn't give you any money!
Ok, how about pilgrim Mockolate mousse?
No he's not!
Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
Nooo!
That was me.
Chandler.
Hello?
And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!
Okay, good luck!
This is Rachel.
Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?
I couldn't eat it! I had five friends who couldn't eat it, and one of them eats books.
Right. Umm, listen since we're-we-re on that subject, umm, I just wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross's mother...
Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend! I'm going to this culinary fair in New Jersey.
But getting over was the hardest thing that I've ever had to do. And I never let myself think about you.
What's up?
Put it out!!
Chandler?
He is the man in the black dress.
It's okay, 'cause y'know what? You don't really need me for the business.
Yeah!
You actually broke her watch? Wow! The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel.
Hey Joey! Aww, you remembered even though you're a big star!
Well you let me know if you can, because y'know I can bake a pie to cover it.
Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember!
I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.
Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?
That's okay.
That's my pie!
Oh.
What was that?
Have you found your dress yet?
What, what are you doing? You can't go out there.
Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner.
Yeah. I bet you can't guess what color my tonsils are? I'll bet the apartment!
What?
Yeah! I bet I can do it.
Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night. It was right here, where is it?
Oh my God, I went to high school with her. Rachel! Hi!
I'm just trying to spice it up!
How, how did that happen?
How'd you pay for them?
Put all my money in me.
Yeah. Where were you?
I'd like a scotch on the rocks with a twist.
Oh, you must be freezing. You know what you need? How about a nice steaming cup of hot Mockolate?
I get the dollhouse!
You stole them from me!
What? We could do it!
Yeah I can! And don't think I don't, because I do! I mean all the time, you betcha!
The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!
Yes, you are so smart!
You start working on that list.
I'm getting married today!!! I think I just cracked a rib. But I don't care because today's my wedding day! My day is finally here!!
I missed you-you ugly, flat faced old freak!
Does anybody want these?
I see pizza!
I think I'll help her out. What is going on here?
I love you.
Did he just say 'Monica bang'?
See? They're as different as night and... later that night.
No, it's not a sign! It's a very old key!
You still work at the multiplex?
You know that's nice, y'know we could put it back there after the surgeons remove it from your colon!
All right, all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some rearranging. But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar!
Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch! And I'm sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?
Ross let me ask you a question. All jokes aside, where is this relationship going?
What?
No that is not what happened with us. Well, I was umm, I was really sad that night because this guy that I was Ross's mom.
Nothing. I don't kn-Umm. I don't know. Umm...
What kinda stuff?
We'll see.
You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes...
Wait a minute, why don't you just call Mark. I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, you've got to make stuff happen.
I think you're done.
Uh, look, Larry honey, umm, I wrote the book on Section 5 and I know that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen.
No. No, just, just, just a couple more boxes. It-it-it's no big deal, all right, I'm-I'm cool. You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!
I'm not your best friend?
007 gets all the ladies.
So Chandler, I guess I'll see you at dinner.
Oh God, I'm so sorry.
So what's Phoebe like?
Pheebes, you know what I'm thinking?
Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.
Oh, she's gonna love that!
Sush!! I cannot believe she is still up there.
And this goes for all guys?
Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man?
Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?
Oh!! You guys knew about this and you didn't tell us?!
I'm making a list of all the things that are most likely to go wrong at the wedding. Now, that way I can be prepared.
What?
No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.
What?
Well actually, Ross doesn't.
Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!
I can't believe this, just like 2 weeks ago I was watching Sudden Death, now I'm on a date with Jean-Claude Van Damme. Can you beat up that guy? Can you beat up that guy?
Yeah. I guess.
Umm...
Oh it's not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines as, say, oh I don't know, having a third nipple.
This was your idea?
Woo-hoo, stuud!
Chandler!!
You just asked me.
Oh. I guess you can. Okay but; I-I have to return it, so you can't like it.
The show?!
Come in! Come in! We're engaged!!!
Could not be more terrified.
Okay.
Then you'd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn't make any sense.
Tomorrow night.
Okay, fine I admit it! I feel terrible! Would you please rub this on my chest?
You love me!
What?
Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late.
Okay..
That's right. That's right. And that is why you can't stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn't come to the wedding.
You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.
He's not gonna say anything, because we're not gonna tell him.
Oh my God, it was incredible.
I love you too Chandler.
How?
How do you feel?
No.
Okay. I'm gonna be the mom that makes the world's best chocolate chip cookies.
Okay, ooh, alright. Name, address... Okay, in case of emergency, call?
Limited seating my ass. Let's see who made the cut. Hi!
I'm telling-If you put that in her apartment you'll never hear the end of it.
Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!
How's the big anniversary dinner?
We should go.
For the sixteenth time, no... I do not think you're obsessive.
That's terrible.
Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half.
