No, it's not a sign! It's a very old key!
I'll get everybody else , finally we can start celebrating my- I'm sorry, uh apparently I've opened the door to the past.
Isn't this great?
Look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, I don't know... but, uh, I'm kind of worried about you.
Ohhhh!
I can't promise anything.
Well there's not much we can do.
No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa.... And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Y'know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.
How ya feelin'?
Ok, let me go check. Your mom want's to say goodbye.
Ice, ice, ice squares anyone? Take a napkin. Alright.
Do you want to go out on a date with her?
Wait a minute...Joey. Joey you can't ask her out, she's your roommate. It-it'll be way too complicated.
She sent the chicken back again?!
No! No. They're umm... They're just uh...ground beef smileys.
Aww, thank you.
Ohh, here you are. Y'know, I'm-I'm glad you decided to hear me out.
Oh, you got the whole night, huh?
Phoebe, what's the matter?
Y'know, maybe it's best that we never got to do it again.
Yeah right.
Okay, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I-I-I was um, I was taking a nap.
Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.
Phoebe, y'know why don't we just go upstairs and have some birthday cake?
I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.
Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?
Well, I don't care! That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my parent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head!
You don't want to know what tonight was.
Yeah, and in the long version, I dump him for telling people the short version.
Hello.
Hi.. how was the game?
So you hit her in the face?
Chandler, please don't think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel...
Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time.
So maybe we should just. . .
You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!
Ross, if you don't tell them, then I will!
Yeah! And the winner gets a hundred bucks.
Okay!
Yes.
Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasn't invited and you got "and guest?!"
W-wait. What is that?
W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...
Hon, you gotta talk to Joey.
Well, you're not.
Nothin', nothin', hey you're a cheapasaurus. I'm kidding, I'm kidding, thank you, I'm very greatful.
Hi!
Who cares? He works in a museum!
She said that?!
Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?
It's good to see you too.
Okay, does it involve something to do with Pete's computer company?
No, we don't.
Come here, I want to show you something!
That's a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!
Well, uh y'know, our guy works with Chandler and he's really nice and smart and he's a great dresser!
Come on, we can't let them win!
Look Rach, we have to move. I mean if they had lost, we would've made them get rid of the birds. Right?
Yay!
Hi! If you're calling before Saturday, you've reached Monica and Chandler. But if you're calling after Saturday, you've reached Mr. and Mrs. Bing! Please leave a message for the Bings!
I don't know, I lost it all ok. I lost it.
Did I squeeze it too hard?
I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Oven and opened Easy Monica's Bakery. I mean I would kill for this job. I mean I can totally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues. But Pete's just doing this because he has a crush on me.
Hey! Good, you're home!
You still have feelings for me don't you?
Okay. That's okay. I-I know that you're very upset right now. I know, I know that wasn't about me.
No I didn't, I said kiwi lime. That's what makes it so special.
Oh my God!
Hey, you got me, put it in.
See? This is exactly why I'm making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.
Well, that's it You gonna crash on the couch?
It's nice to meet you. Janine...?
Oh my God, sit down! Sit down! How long as it been since we've seen each other?
So then, are you going to dump Jason?
Would you stop? We've only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don't even know if he's gonna propose.
Hey! There you are!
Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really. Yeah, Ross is great. He's uh, he's in a whole other place. No, he's gone. No no, you don't have to fly back, really. What do you mean this might be your only chance? Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet.
But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress.
It's unbelievable! I-I can't believe that sign didn't work!
My parents spent the money for our wedding!
What are you doing?
Phoebe, don't worry about it. I'm sure she wants to live with you.
I don't know, Chandler. Let's take a look.
We'll be right there! Can't you just say it starts later?
Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?
I just... can't do it.
Yeah, you have to go fight for her!
So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?
What about your breath?!
Wait, we're supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer.
Subtle guys!
Are you okay?
Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!
Hey.
Yeah-yeah, you remember how I call you bunny?
All right! You and me! Let's go! Right now!
What's wrong Phoebe?
No, I can't afford this either. No. I-I-I'm, I'm just to figure out which one I want then I'm gonna get it at Kleinman's, this discount place in Brooklyn, day after tomorrow they are having a huge sale.
That's right! You lose sucker!! Please still marry me.
Hi! Hey, Pete you're back! Hey, check this out.
You bet.
See, didn't I tell you?! You're getting over Ross already!
Oh yeah, picked a guy, 37135.
It wasn't funny at all! Why would you do that? Why didn't you pick me?
Ok, Mr. Heckles, we'll try to keep it down.
See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you?
Hey, Rache. You know what we haven't played in a while?
Oh, I'm- I'm so sorry!
Ross, I thought you were over this.
That's your call.
Well yeah, but, you know, uh, 27 is a dangerous eye age.
Yes, you did!
Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!
Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.
Okay fine, now Ross...
I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus?
White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy? The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt?
Come on Chandler, come on, I can handle Ross. Hold on! Hey Ross. What's up bro?
I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.
What are you doing?
Pizza?!
Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet!
Listen, um honey, I appreciate this but you don't have to keep hanging out with them for me, I mean, they have each other.
I-I-I think you look great.
Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight's specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag-Why is nobody writing these down?
Chandler!
Oh God, I'm so sorry.
I can't believe her, y'know it's just-it's so typical.
Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.
Ok. Hey, why don't you ask Richard?
Oh Joey, Melanie called, said she's gonna be late.
Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.
OK, I'll see you later babe.
All right, hand me that other box of photos; that's the very last one.
What the hell is this?
What?
I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.
Something to remember me by!
Give it to me.
Chandler, relax it's not a contest. Certainly not a close one.
Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football game called the 'Geller Bowl.'
Oh, would you let it go already?! You're fine!
Rachel would be Phoebe's, I would be Rachel's, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.
No, sweetie, I-I trust you.
I'm telling-If you put that in her apartment you'll never hear the end of it.
Okay, we'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second floor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth.
Hi!
She's just upset because she, uh, she buttered a spider into her toast this morning.
Phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia.
No. You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out.
I swear you said you had the keys.
Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.
You wanted it to be a surprise.
Yeah but I'm not keeping it.
Oh I can't. Dr. Roger is coming over again.
Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like you've never sucked before!
Yes!
Rachel you have to read this book. It's called Be Your Own Windkeeper. It's about how women need to become more empowered.
Put your head back.
I know I love you!
You okay?
Hi...May I help you?
What? Wait! Why? Chandler! Chandler! Wait! I'm sorry, I was just playing for one second! I was trying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see Richard again, I won't! He means nothing to me!
Hey Rach, aren't these candlesticks mine?
Yeah, what is it?
I did.
Ow!!!!!!! Ow-ow-ow-ow!
Aw, I'm sorry sweetie that she doesn't feel the same way.
All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.
We both do that!
I won the game.
He doesn't have anyone.
How's it going?
You're kidding!
Ooh, are we allowed to lie in the vows?!
How did it go with Frank and Alice?
Wow, is that Michelle?
Hell no, we'll pay!
Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, they're still extinct.'
Oh my God, you're a freak.
Oh please! Why else would you have made out with Ross?!
Over here dad.
You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!
I have no idea.
Our guy's a great dancer!
Pheebs?
I don't know how museums work in England but, here, you're not supposed to take stuff.
Very good, so good.
So, did you play in college? sweatshirt he's wearing.)

Honey! Dinner's ready!
Okay. Oh! A coloring book!
Oh, I haven't had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler. Wow, I'm never gonna have that feeling again am I?
Here's your tea Phoebe.
Wow, those pills really worked, huh?
Well that's it. People never say `We need to talk' unless it's something bad.
Dead leg!!
It's okay. It's okay. Just pretend that it didn't happen! Okay? No one needs to know! I mean, Phoebe's not an official ballplayer! I mean, only official ballplayers can drop the ball!
Oh wait I forgot my wrap.
Uh, you left out the stupid part.
