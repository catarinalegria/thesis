Hey Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.
Okay. Okay, we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels great.
You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch? Ohhh! I saw her with you on the subway and now she's asleep on the couch!
Bye!
What?
Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July.
Ok.
I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, "I'll just tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours." And he said, "Laundry? Is that my new nickname?" And you said, "No! You know what your nickname is, Mr. Big."
Uh-huh.
Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica's and she and Chandler had a big fight and they're not moving in.
Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know.
Y'know, I don't-I don't know. Let me, let me check.
Oh, come on! He's glad that I came, he doesn't want me to go anywhere, balls flying all over the place!
Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce?
Well, then talk!
I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents? Why do they have to become people? Why do they have... Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?
What? I was just trying to teach you.
Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?
Oh, hey, don't you have to go pick up Emily?
What?! What else did he say?
Op, look! Claire forgot her glasses! And she's gonna be really needing these to keep an eye on that boyfriend, who, I hear, needs to keep his stapler in his desk drawer, if you know what I'm talking about.
Right.
Not great.
Right.
Hey-hey-hey that's funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy! You wanna know what else is really funny?!
Okay, I'm totally cool!
It just might be too hard, given the history and all that...
Well, how can you be a tour guide, don't you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?
Oh, y'know what, I didn't want cinnamon on this.
Good luck to ya!
Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.
You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him. Yeah! Like if I would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. Or uh, or my underwear.
Me too!
Well umm, maybe we could uhh... Ah-ha! Too slow!!
Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in lost and found.
Really?
Thank God. Food.
Ohh! That's great!
Ooooh yeah.
Okay, you know what? I don't have it, but I can tell you exactly where it is on my night stand, and...okay. But you know what? I have my drivers license and I have a twenty.
No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? Are people eating my dip?
No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge step down!
I know, I know. And oh, and this time Chip promised that-that this time it will last at least for an entire song!
In a month?
Hi-e!!
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't know that.
What happened to uh, MEG.?
Yeah, I can do that.
Oh, Joey! Sorry!
Well, Joshua's coming in tomorrow and since I don't have the guts to ask him out, I'm going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.
Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex. "Was it good for you?"
Uh, I'm holding Ben.
All right Ross!! I get it!!
Hey, honey! What's the matter? Fine, I was just trying to be nice! Whoa!
Oh! I have your key. Here you go.
Sophisticated like a hooker?
I am so on board!
Aahh, I'm a... chef at a restaurant uptown.
Hey!
Ohhhh!
You'd be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me?
Thank you. What a bitch.
Oh! What a great way to earn some extra pocket money.
Oh, yeah! Yeah!
Y'know, you-you also could've used uh, lamps and then followed the light.
But honey, I think she's moving in with Chandler.
Sit down!
Oh?
You remember when we got these?
Oh-oh!
What?
Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, it'll still be broken then.
Wh--Why don't I tell you over here?
What? C'mon, talk to me.
My drinking?
Let's dry 'em again.
I'm just not going.
Well umm...
So, how was the party?
We love you, we're here for you.
Okay.
Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!
Oh yeah, sorry. Wait honey, so what did you do that made dad cut you off?
You wanna go in the bedroom? It's a little more comfortable.
Hey.
All right, will you, will you at least tell him how hollow and unsatisfying this, dating tons of women thing is!
No.
Okay, your band is playing at Arnold's, collect three cool points. Which means, I have five, and that means I get Joey's boxers!
Surprise me.
Isn't that a line from the show?!
Hello? Like he was really gonna send you one? She was a big girl.
Oh, yeah, I'm not, I'm not hungry.
Phoebe are you serious?
Oh no, you're the best.
I had a bra.
Oh... Italy, I think.
Oh yeah surfer?
All right are you guys gonna come down?
Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody who's had a baby. Like your mom?
Ahhhh.
Oh my God! It sure didn't look this way when I lived here.
Hi, I'm sorry I'm late but I am ready, ready to talk you up! When does Liz's father get here?
I mean maybe you didn't hear about a serious relationship called me and Joshua?
Really?
Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!
Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up.
You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don't tell the guy that!
I mean n-not-not fake at all like most famous people.
I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I'm with him, I'm totally, totally...
Yeah?
Ross, honey, is there anything we can do?
You know.
Oww!
Alright you guys, I'm takin' off my shirt.
Okay. Ah, well we'll just see about that, okay. I will read The Shining, and you will read Little Women.
Ohhh... I'm fine.
Oh my God Phoebe, this is impossible! We can't do this by Friday! We have to find a place. We have to invite people! We have to get food! There's just too much to do! It's impossible! We can't do it! We cannot do it! We cannot do it!
Oh.
Could tonight be the Night?
That's great!
This is Bonnie? This is Bonnie? You're Bonnie?
God! Don't-We can't let her start getting ready! This is too awful! Oh God, but wait she'll be in the gown and then he won't show up and then she's gonna have to take off the gown...
And now, y'know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so..
Yeah.
Here are your cakes.
Oh Ross, would you stop, you got me, I'm dating you.
Anyway, um, I guess this belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me.
But I...
It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!
Hey!
As are you...
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. See Phoebe, Phoebe.
Okay.
I did but she doesn't think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.
Well, h-how is this like that?
Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.
The beef? Yeah, that was weird to me, too. But then, y'know, I thought "well, there's mincemeat pie," I mean that's an English dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, y'know. Oh! by the way, can I borrow some Rum from your place?
Oh that's what you want.
Hello!
Wel-wel-well what are we gonna do?
Yeah.
What-what are-what are these?
Okay, all right, give me the mug! I'll keep the mug.
Ross, there is no us, OK.
Ok. Look uhh, Mon I'm, I'm really sorry.
I can not believe your trading me!!
In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a Post-It on it that said, "Must go out today." So you just keep looking in there! All right?
They're in Vermont!! How could this happen?!
Okay.
Hey, you guys...
And I'm in it? Then let me read it.
Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!
I don't even know how I would go about it.
I mean y'know, I'm thinking. You could bring her, and you guys could go up to your old room, and not make out.
C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat.
Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!
Oh! Hi you guys, oh my God! You'll never gonna believe happened to me today! I am sitting in my office and...
Blow it.
Oh! I've got a lot of those too!
Okay! All right! How was she?
Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anyway-umm, what is this book about?
Really! What is with that guy? I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you.
Ohh, well I'm not totally back yet, but thank you.
Oh my....
Yeah, sure?
Well, don't look at me! My hair's straight! Straight! Straight! Straight!
Okay, let me just change.
Oh no! Yes! Of course, I know that! I just-I meant y'know are you still a 'We' or are you just 'You?'
Don't just say yes! This isn't a game, Joey you can really get hurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!
Pheebs, Monica tripped me, I don't think I can ever run again, ever!
A lot.
All right!
Ohh, so do you! Did you lose weight?
No. I can't, you're a totally different person to me now. I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. God, and now I just can't stop picturing with her, I can't, it doesn't matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. It's just changed, everything. Forever.
Wha... forget it Ross, no, I am not gonna stand here and make a list of. . .
So umm, how-how are we gonna mess with them?
Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
You're right, I don't have to apologize. Sorry. Damnit!
No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop.
Well of course we will help you decide! We will do anything we can to help you! Now, I would like to make a toast, to the future Mrs. Chandler Bing , my best friend, and truly one of the nicest people that...
Yeah!
Wait, I-I just said "leave."
Ohh! Hi!
Thank you, Okay, Okay.
Oh, yeah, check it. Definitely, I want some of that.
What bank is this?
Ohh, great!
Well! Is everybody else having just the best time?!
Oh no, no-no-no, that's not, not, not, what he is doing. He's just, he's just really romantic.
Any chance you think the couch looks good there?
What do you mean, you fold? Hey, come on! What is this? I thought that 'once the cards were dealt, I'm not a nice guy.' I mean, what, were you just full of it?
Really!
Oh really?!
Storming out!
How is that the silver lining?
Well, it's my cat.
Hi Daddy.
Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now! Oh, thank you!
You went shopping?! What, and then you just came in here and paraded it right under Jill's nose when you know she's trying to quit. Wow, you guys are terrible!
What's going on?
Hi, welcome to our tropical Christmas party. You can put your coats and sweaters and pants and shirts in the bedroom.
No honey, we're sorry, we didn't mean it. I love you. I love you.
Okay. Switch places with me! Switch places with me! Come on! I'll go under, you go over!
I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.
How many you want?
Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.
Mexico?
Oh honey he doesn't need my help.
So from that you think you've got me all figured out? Well, you don't! Y'know I-I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here!
Phoebe! You picked Joey and Ross?! You can not have two backups!
It'll be a short one.
Hey! So, did you quit?
I don't care! I don't care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it's actually ended. And, I don't care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!
Uh-hmm, uh-hmm, yeah, yeah, I really liked your hands.
Okay. Okay honey, he's fine, he's fine, let's just put him down. Come here, Ben. See that's a good boy. How could you do that to him!! Ross trusted me, what is he going to say?!
So it would just be, me alone?
Hi guys! This is Josh. Josh, these are my friends, and that's Ross.
That is the most ridiculous...
Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument.
Okay!
Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol.
What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps lying to me! That's it! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go over there and confront them right now!
Jill?
Bye, Pheebs.
Eh! Stop it!
Hey!
Oh my God! Oh my God! I can't go! I'm gonna be too nervous!
Ow!
Oh, everything's pink.
Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written. No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a writer.
Hey Mon, little question for ya! How do you think this suit will look on an assistant buyer?
Ohh, Phoebe, what am I going to do?
Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.
Ohhh, this is the least jealous I've ever been!
Okay-okay that-that's amazing. How did you know that?
Hey, hubby!
Well, Ross, we were worried about you. We didn't know how you were going to react.
Okay! All right, pick a half.
Dealer takes two. What do you bet?
Oh, wait and on the nineteenth a secret crush announces itself.
Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!
You're right! I mean you're right! It wasn't just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in.
Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?
So, he's on the show, he knows what happens.
Well, I thought you liked doing it.
Okay.
Melissa!
I didn't... I never said that.
That is not a tattoo, that is a nothing. I finally got her back in the chair, bairly touched her with a needle, she jumped up screaming, and that was it.
You know, actually it's more like, hi.
Hey! You guys umm, I want you to meet Sebastian.
It's Robert Bobby.
Hey roomie!
You were gonna drink the fat.
Would you let me talk.
Space cowboy!
What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?
Do you even understand what off the rack means?!
Hey! Y'know what? Let's talk about relationships!
Ross honey, this is very nice, but, but I-I got a crisis.
Hello, Chip.
Well, I do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat.
Oh my God, honey that's great.
Uh-huh, go on.
Oh!
I did it! Oh! I finished it! I did it all by myself! And there's nobody to hug!
Yeah. I'm sorry.
Okay.
The thing is y'know, that you're married to Emily.
Oh well, no I...
That's-that's great! See? I already feel like I know you a little better! Thank you. Okay, come on. Now we can go eat. Let's go.
Okay.
Ok.
Good luck, honey!
Um, Russ, you ready?
God, he's good.
All right, so are we not having dinner at all?
Ohh, you're so sweet!
Ive never done that.
I'll take a coffee. So how was your big date last night?
Ra.... Er.. Barbra.
And y'know what else, oh my God, are they gonna love you.
Okay, calm down, here they are.
What did you get her?
No it's not!
Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight. It's been kinda a long day.
Ohh, he's married! Ross is married. I can't-I still can't believe it.
What?! I didn't have a good time in Greece! Ross abandoned me! Okay, I couldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up to me all the time going, "Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying?" I mean, it was sooo humiliating. I felt like such an idiot! I mean, it's all my fault! And you know why, because I make very bad decisions.
Oh, okay.
Hey, do you believe this? Do you believe they are actually getting married?
Do you want to put the book in the freezer?
You let Joey drive it?!
Oh yeah. Well, at least I wasn't too chicken to tell some guy I thought he was cute.
Ross! Stop it! Come on!
Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist...
What? Who the hell is Emily- noooo!!
What?!
Ross gave it to me.
Yes, my wind. How do you expect me to grow if you won't let me blow?
I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry!
Okay.
Hey, Pheebs!
It's not a baby! It's a cat!
Listen honey, can you keep dad occupied, I'm gonna go talk to mom for a while.
Whoa! Hey-hey, you planning on inviting us?
Oh my God! Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives, just walked in here!
Ok, Ross, try to hear me. Ok, I, hey, I'm not gonna lie to you. Ok, it was good with Paolo.
Hey!
Hey!
If anybody asks, I'm your sister, Joan. Listen. C'mon, you guys. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me!
I know, but it's just it's the first time, and I just don't want her to think that because I didn't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know?
Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back!
Oh-ohh, thank you.
Yeah, 15 hundred dollars.
Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag. Oh, it does work!
Why, how much is this gonna cost?
What is she doing here?
Oh it was great! It was great! I went down there just like you said, y'know? And we talked business. Kim totally took my opinions.
Jurassic Park could happen.
Oh, hi!
Smell familiar?
Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!
Daddy, daddy, you know what, I really wanna hear more about this, I really do, but I just have, I just have to do a, some stuff.
Men just take out wind?
Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos
Ugh, horrible! I did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing!
Yeah, you should, really.
What are you ever gonna use that for?!
All right. All right Phoebe I will let you have him, but you owe me; you owe me big!
Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!
We don't want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle.
Oh my God! Phoebe look, it's Ross and that girl.
Ok, we can do this now, can't we Ben? Yes we can, yes we can. There. I did it. I did it. Look at that, oh, stays on and everything. Hi.
Yeah! Yeah. They're...they're-they're my friends, uh, Monica Stephanopolus and uh, and Chandler Acidofolus.
Okay.
Okay, I'll see you back at home, if I ever get a flight out of here.
What?
All gone! So, farm birds, huh?
What?!
He-he said Rachel, right? Do you think I should go up there?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, who's gonna eat all our food, and tie up our phone lines, and - is that my bra? What the hell you doin' with my bra?
Yeah, he dumped me. He said, "Rachel, I can't do this. Even though you are a very, very, very beautiful woman. I can't do this. I'm married and I'm sorry." And then I don't know why but he said, "and you will never get promoted. Especially not above Kim, who is an integral cog in the Ralph Lauren machine."
Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?
Oh, it's okay.
Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got all over head!
Oh yeah, they're really great! Aren't they?
Oh no-no-no! No, I got this all under control.
Well, you know, honey, I don't think everybody gets Smelly Cat. You know, I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh!
Oh, hi!
Hi!
Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama.
Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.
Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks? Spoiled?
Would you guys stop.
Wow! What do you do now?
Joey?!
Well, we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys used for catering and we realised...
That's crazy! You can't do that! What are you going to tell her? Oh God. Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you?
Yeah, y'know what? Don't look at it. Seriously, don't look at it.
Thank you.
So what are you guys going to do?
Are you pregnant?!
Okay.
Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happen to me? A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine. Ross was just Ross, just this guy. Now he's Rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I can't have.
Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.
Fine.
I guess.
I'm just cleaning up.
Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.
Honey wait, Joey, I'm sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it...
Look Joey, come on she's so perfect for you! I mean she's sweet, she-she likes baseball, and she-she had two beers at lunch.
Yes, I do.
I'm gonna do it too!
Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.
Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer?
Pheebs, that's great!
Uh well, uh this is a silent auction. They lay out all the stuff here and then you write down your offer and then the highest bid gets it.
They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!
Richard? I'm not gonna go see your ex-boyfriend!
I accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back y'know of course, 'cause "Let's bring the girl back who kisses everybody!"
Oh, y'know what? I can't. I have to have dinner with that Melissa girl.
I cannot believe I'm gonna meet Jessica Ashley!
What?! No! Why?!
Yeah it is, mostly because I get to boss people around, which I just love to do.
Y'know you're-you're probably wondering about the old date on there.
Yeah, umm, no honey.
My God!
Yes I am!
I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phone...
Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing.
I have the best job in the entire world! The most adorable guy came over today, and I got to dress him up all day!
Yeah. And y'know who should've shut their drapes? Is that perverted old couple two doors over.
Hm-m.
Oh-ho!
Oh. Yes! I would so move out!
Huh. A moo-point?
Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!
He even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it.
I care!
Yeah.
We're not gonna do this, all right? She's just gonna think that we're doin' it.
Oh my God. Did you talk to him?
Monica look! Look-look-look! Here is that table that I ordered.
Aww, look at the little thing.
What the hell was that?!
Hey! What's goin' on?
Hi.
Oh, well, it pretty much sucked. How was yours?
Yeah, I guess. I-I... I mean, do-do you think we're ever gonna have that?
No, was he any good in it?
What's up, Ross?
I think he's stealing from me.
Mmm-hmmm. Oh, so typical. Ooo, I'm a man. Ooo, I have a penis. Ooo, I have to win money to exert my power over women.
What?
Hi! Just so you know, we-we didn't mean to fog you, we thought you were like a yeti or something.
Oh, stop that! Don't kid about that! Will all the stars be there?
I don't know!
Well there's an idea!!
Yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We sort of, we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases.
Hi!
Hey!
Ok, who ordered what?
Okay.
Hello? Uh, Rachel. Great, someone is in our apartment. Call the cops!
Okay. Well that's pretty much all that we have-Oh! Oh! Have you ever had a virgin margarita?
Really?!
Chandler told me.
Oh my God! Oh my God!! Ohh, Jessica Lockhart!! In my apartment!! I am such a huge fan! I am such a huge fan!
Ooh, the gift shop!
Okay, okay, I checked. We have: Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Cinnamon Stick, Camomile, Mint Medley, Blackberry, and.. oh, wait, there's one more, um.. Lemon Soother. You're not the guy that asked for the tea, are you? Okay.
All right, it's okay. One little setback is okay, just don't let it happen again, all right? Now since daddy paid for all this stuff, I should take it all away. But I'm just gonna take the-the pajmena. And the uh, and the uh pants. Y'know what, I'm just gonna take it all away, 'cause that way you'll just really learn the lesson. Okay? All righty, I'm gonna run a couple of errands and I will see you at dinner.
Thank you.
Well, what happened to your jam plan?
Well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans?
Monica, what should I do?
Okay, so let's play for some pepper! Stop spending my money!
Monica! Come on!
Right!
Okay, Pheebs, can I ask? So, hes going out with her. I mean, is it really so terrible?
Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.
Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before. Only $98.50 to go.
Thank you.
I also said number one.
Well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them?
Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!
Well, what is the truth?
You did!
Yeah no, I mean it was at a flea market, so it was y'know, it was like a dollar.
All right, first name on the speed dial is mom.
Ugh. Wait, wait, wait.
Is he here?
Hey!
Oh, what a load of crap. That is a dot. Your mother is up in heaven going, 'Where the hell is my lily, you wuss?' OK, Phoebe, that is not a tattoo, this is a tattoo.
Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided thisthis whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea.
Yeah.
Oh yeah? Another night of birdogging the chickas?
Oh man!
That's great!
Okay.
No. No, no, I'm not ready! How can I be ready? "Hey, Rach! You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?" Come on, I can't do this!
Oh! Ross is sooo great!
I just don't want him to meet anybody until I am over my crush-And I will get over it. It's-it's not like I love him, it's just physical! But-I mean I get crushes like this all the time! I mean hell, I had a crush on you when I first met ya!
Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing.
Op.
I will not! I'm the divisional head of men's sportswear!
Excuse me? Can I help you with anything?
Well, do you want to hear what actually happened or Joey's lewd version?
Joey, you're such an amazing actor! How do you know where Dr. Drake Remoray leaves off and Joey Tribbiani begins?
Honey, I'm sorry.
Bathroom's up there.
All right, fine, but don't get mad at me. It's-it's just a little hard to believe.
Is he romantic with her?
"I'm Monica, I don't get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!"
Joshua.
Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't this against the rules?
I know.
Hey Mon!
What?
Well, maybe-maybe I could be your roommate Pheebs.
And Chandler, you're gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know Raquel can't be late.
Well, he gets the other one all riled up.
No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.
Yeah. Umm, unless you wanna come inside?
Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio!
That sounds great! I'd love to live at Warren's!! I love Warren! Thank you!
Hi.
Oh, God, ask them what they want.
So, like, you guys all have jobs?
I've got some bad news.
Hang in there. You hang in there.
No, I was ten. I just developed early.
What? Who?
Ohh, you can say. Come on, I don't want you to feel like you can't tell me things.
All right, fine. Um, you were not the only one there. Joey was there too.
What? Oh, well then y'know what? I think Monica would be very interested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy.
Ohh! I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now!
I know you did! I bought the same one! And if she sees your table she's gonna know that I lied to her. I told her ours was an original.
Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories......about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.
Okay, well then how about a handshake? Oh God I'm sorry! Oh God, I'm sorry! I did not mean to touch that-I mean you there. There. Uhh, okay, so thank-thank you, I'm going to leave now thank you very much uh-huh, thank you so-Hey! I'll see you Monday!
Ah, yeah!
I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.
My God!
Guess what?
What? Come on, you do what you want to do. Do we always have to do everything together?
Why hasn't he called Rachel? Why? Why? I don't understand. Why? He said he'll call. Why? Why? Chandler I'm telling you she has flipped out, she's gone crazy!
Well, you're lucky you never met that bitch Sharon Majesky. Anyway, umm... The rest of you life, y'know? Any regrets?
Really?! You think that will work?
OK!
Okay, do you see, do you see what you're keeping me married too?!
OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus- Ow. That hurt
Oh! Did you hear that?! My dad's proud of me! My dad's proud of me.
Oh God! This is silly, I'm gonna see you in a couple of hours!
That's also the smaller piece. Okay, there you go. Enjoy your half my friend, but that is it. No sharing. No switching, and don't come crying to me if you eat your piece to fast. Oh!!!!
Yeah?
I guess you weren't there.
Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?
Oops, sorry. Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually, we have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.
Oh, my god.
Okay. Uh, want something-want something to drink?
Well look who's here!
Mom!
Wow! H-umm! Hi! Yes, uh I'm sorry the models are actually down the hall.
No, I did, but tell me again, because it's so romantic.
What-yeah-what, y'know what? I hope Emily is a lesbian.
No.
I cannot believe that you didn't tell me that we are still married!!
Yeah.
You think you're gonna get out of this on a technicality?
Yes, you did.
Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!
I wrote you a letter.
What the hell was that?!
Ohh! Oh my God!
Okay. Okay.
Thank you!
Oh my God! Calling from Rome! Bon giorno, caro mio.
All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!
Absolutely not.
Okay, just sweep it.
Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they're probably not even listening!
All right! Ross, do you think it's easy for me to see you with somebody else?
Joey, is what she just said umm-Oh my God. You were actually gonna...
Exactly.
Come on, it's not a big deal! We stayed up all night coming up with a plan so that us dating will not be a problem.
Mm-mmm.
Oh honey, this is his office too. I told you we're Joanna's two assistants.
Okay, bye-bye!
OK, so that's... that's what, two bottles? And yet somehow we went through five?
You get away from me!! You sick, sick, sick, sick-o!!
Okay? You ready?
Closer than here?
Awww, just like his daddy.
Of course they're listening to you! Everybody listens to you.
Um, Barry.
All right, y'know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat?
Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.
One hour.
Two, two babies?
Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick- you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
So Joey I just hooked Ross and Chandler up with some tuxedos for the wedding, do you need one?
Well, y'know, sometimes that helps.
'Cos I was gonna say there's no way you could've done the end the way you guys did it back then!
Yeah...
Not unless different means the same.
How is she?
Umm, Joanna? I wanna talk about that interview.
Because I knew you were lying!
When did you go to a sperm bank?
Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?
Oh God, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that you just forget that I told you this?
Because I promised Mindy I would.
But I...
Thank you. Oww!!!! God!
Yes! And please tell her to bring a cake!
Look-look-look-look-look, my first pay check! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me!
Okay!
Phoebe, come on can we finish this later? Cause I wanna go running before it gets dark. Oh! Why don't you come with me?!
: Thank you. : I saw your twenty-five, and I raise you... seven.
Joey, come on! We just went over this!
Oh, come on!
Oh, ah nothin'. I just felt like hangin' out here and reading.
Phoebe! It's 6 o'clock in the morning! Why aren't you at Gary's?
Well, I, umm...
Ooh, Pheebs, what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are?
What are you? Monica!! Stop it!! Oh my God! Stop it!
Yeah-yeah, y'know if-if there was just like one little area where I-that I think we need-we would need to work on; I-I would think it was we're just not crazy enough!
Uh-huh. No, I hear what you're saying and-and-and that makes a lot of sense but can I just say one more thing? Look how pretty!
All right.
This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this?
Really?
Both of them are here, both of them, both of them are here?
Luisa? Oh my God! Monica! It's Luisa!
So?
Hey!
Ross, she's gonna start getting ready soon!
You?
Really?! You think so? Y'know, I had just rolled out of bed.
Ohhh well. Y'know what honey? The best thing to do to get over a guy is to start dating someone else. Oh! There is this great guy you will love at work named Bob! He's a real up-and-comer in Human Resources.
I cannot push it in!
Yeah.
Yep!
I got it!
Joey, just-just he-he's new in town and I know he doesn't have any guy friends. Just take him to like a ball game or something. I'll really appreciate it.
I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against that thing!
I feel like we're the only two people in the world. Oops. Sorry.
Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.
Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.
Oh no-no-no don't say but! No-no, but's never good! Let's just leave it at, you like me and I like you.
Oh my God! Listen to you talkin' about having kids. Oh my Joey. Oh, please don't get married before I do.
A big idiot.
You seem to really like her.
Oh, hi!
Good! 'Cause I've got a product report to read, it's like eight pages, I hope I don't fall asleep.
Oh, this lipstick looks just great on you.
And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up?
Oh, Phoebe, do I wanna hear this?
...Monica.
Ask me what?
Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight. I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding.
No.
Mr. Treeger.
I love working with designers!
All right.
Oh hi! Y'know, I just wanted to see if there were any leads on the old job front.
What's up Joe?
Hi, how was the movie?
We're gonna find love!
Oh totally, totally. Y'know it's not that big of deal, we already kinda did it once y'know.
No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?
Well, then, you'll just have to eat the other lamps.
Oh, please, you wanted to get caught.
Hey, don't listen to them. I think it's sexy.
Ugh! Look you guys, I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't care what you think! I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson. Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?!
Well, I-I-I've been on Standby for a flight home for hours.
Well! Good night. I'm going upstairs.
Hey!
Come on. Oh! And, uh, by the way....
Ok.
God, I'm not lame, okay. I can do something. I can throw, would you let me throw, come on this is my game too.
How can you not remember us kissing?!
What's-what's going on? Phil's really pissed!
Vanilla?!
I hate when Ross is right!
Yeah.
Yeah, looks that way. First ones here! Wooo!!
I know. I always thought if you and I got married, it would be the one that stuck. And it wouldn't be a secret, and we wouldn't have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut.
Come on you gotta have one!
And with Chandler in the next room. What are you, what are you sick?
Well, y'know, possibly. You didn't tell him that, though? Right?
And your lap does not count! Okay? Come on help me move this.
Wow. Well, I guess it was Cupid who brought her here.
Um-hmm.
Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry I forgot, she's not a lesbian.
Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me.
Yeah but-but-but you liked me! Oh my God, I can't believe this, all this time, I liked you and you liked me!
Pheebs, I don't know what to say. I guess the flea market was just better last time.
You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!
Wait! No, that's ridiculous. Come on, he lives three blocks away!
It sure is.
Just once!
Hi, Mindy. Hi, it-it's Rachel. Yeah, I'm fine. I-I saw Barry today. Oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me. No, no, it's okay. I hope you two are very happy, I really do. Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end up getting married and having kids- and everything- I just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose. Okay, I know it was a cheap shot, but I feel so much better now.
Yes, but you can not tell Ross 'cause I want to surprise him.
What?! You got us evicted!!
Is my hook unhooked? These things keep falling down, I can't. . .
Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell.
Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that it was a club they went to. Oh God, I'm, I'm sorry.
That-that is your make out buddy. Don't you recognize him? Oh wait. Ohh, Phoebe I love you. Kiss me please.
Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?
Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn't go with Mark?
Oh, I would love some. But y'know what? Y'know what? Let's not drink it here. I'm feeling kinda crazy. You wanna go to Newark?
So umm, what's this book about?
Well, you should have.
Yeah, remember that thing I told you that happened yesterday? Well it didn't happen.
Yeah.
Oh, honey that's awful.
Just get out! Now!!
Hey!
What?
Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right there.
Ok, thanks Pheebs Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!
Bye.
Hi! How are you?
What?!
Okay. Oh wait! One more thing umm, do-do we still need to uh settle the question of "us?"
Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?
Oh yeah! I know.
Hey! What's up Mon?
No, absolutely. Y'know like it was umm...
Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over.
I just- I don't think us getting back together is a good idea.
Uh well, y'know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day...
Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just share too much?
Okay, fine. Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why I'm a terrible waitress? Because, I don't care. I don't care. I don't care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don't care where the tray spot is, I just don't care, this is not what I want to do. So I don't think I should do it anymore. I'm gonna give you my weeks notice.
Hey Ross? Umm, I just ran into Caitlin in the hallway and-and uh, you must be getting better at this flirting stuff than I thought.
Oh, hey!
No, we never do that
Uhh, the mailman, the super.
Yeah, and you don't mind if I call, because you only want good things for me.
Oh yeah, scared the hell out of me. I thought we'd lost you forever. Pheebs, you lie down?
Yeah, ohh! Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth? I have a crush on you; I am attracted to you. Gee, I-I know that I freaked him out
Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.
Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.
Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute honest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'.
Now Joey remember, if you win you have to hug me! You hug me!
Bye, Chandler.
Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! She's coming!
All right, we were shaking hands and he kinda leaned toward me... Y'know maybe he was going to open the door, but I totally miss read him and I uhhh...
So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.
You know what?
Oh for God sake just pick a piece!
Uh-oh.
No? Y'know, I can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue.
Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.
Well, are we all together? Like in a group?
Where are you going?
Oh God, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for nine--teen blocks. Oh. Oh my God.
Well, well, you said it was practice!
Hi!
Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.
Oh My God, Phoebe, that's not Ralph Lauren. That's Kenny the copy guy.
You.
Oh, you go out with him.
Hey, I thought that guy was married.
Phoebe is gonna be Monica's maid of honor!
Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, she's gonna get over this, y'know? I mean, so you said my name! Y'know you just said it 'cause you saw me there, if you'd have seen a circus freak, you would've said, "I take thee circus freak." Y'know, it didn't mean anything, it's just a mistake. It didn't mean anything. Right?
Did I miss it? Did I miss it?
You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. I mean, it's not sweet, it's not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear, I know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying, "Rachel!"
I feel...
All right, fine.
Oh, Ross, I'm sorry. I completely ruined your evening.
But you could teach us.
Ross!
Ok, so anyway, you were telling me about Paris, it sounds fascinating.
I couldn't be inner. Monica?
Okay. Oh wait! Umm, did you send those contracts to Milan?
Look at her.
Yes you do. You think of it as your apartment, and I'm just somebody who rents a room.
Cats, how long do they live figuring you don't... y'know, throw 'em under a bus or something?
Hello? Um, yeah, uh, Okay ah, hold on a second, lemme lemme just check and see if see if she's here.
No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.
Great! Thanks!
Noo!!
Oh, what a fun office.
What-what if I marry Ross-Or Joey?
Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why don't you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?
I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh, this is our cart.
Is that the heartbeat?
This one is uh Paul O'Neil.
My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce. But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them. But you know what, you know what the good news is? I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours.
Ohh...
At his apartment. Is this juice?
Hey, Mon, I was just doing the dishes!
Happy Thanksgiving!
Oh gosh, she's going to kill me.
What-wh-what so we'll just stay married forever?!
What do you get? Emily!! Emil-Whoa!! Okay! So that's me as a cheerleader! Ta-dum!
I don't care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!
Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover.
I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.
Oh. Here's your moisturiser. Hi!
You were with Julie?
Yeah, that didn't work.
Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.
Oh yeah, sure, that too.
I mean if you think about it, I mean Ross did learn something from each marriage.
Thank you.
Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't miss that.
Because! Because I was sad.
Yeah! No that's what I was thinking.
Because!
What? What!?! You kissed him?
Okay!
I'll do it.
Okay, stop-stop! Phoebe?!
Oh, Joey, look who it is.
Monica. You've, you've done it right?
Yeah well, you know what, so is uh, Sorentino's.
Yeah but Phoebe...
Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here...
Oh-ho, my God! That was so awesome! You totally got him back for calling you fat! He was just drooling all over you. That must've felt so great!
Oh, y-yeah, so, you-you love me!
What?!!
Honey that sounds like fun.
No, you know what, I think you should go.
Joey! I can't believe you just did that!
Oh yeah? Did he pull the old...
Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no, that's OK, I don't need them. I'm going for fours.
You do?
Well, what'm I gonna do? What'm I gonna do?
What did, what did he say?
Good ones?
Okay.
Really?
Great!! That's great!
Ross said my name. Okay? My name. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me! Okay, don't believe me, I know I'm right-do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?
No, you're not an idiot, Ross. You're a guy very much in love.
Uh-huh!
Hey. Oh, poor Pheebs.
What?!
You have no respect for anybody's privacy!
Oh, I know...
That is great. Hey, y'know who doesn't have to job hunt? Ross. He works at the university.
Okay... Let me put it this way. Anything from Crabtree and Evelyn?
Joey?
None.
No, I think I'm gonna catch up on my correspondence.
Hi! Phoebe.
What are you doing here?
Ohh, ohh.
Did-did you take these back?
Ohh Tag, umm...you're such a great guy and we have sooo much fun together but I don't-I don't...
What?
Thanks!
Oh yeah. Right. So now, are-do you, do you still do music?
Okay, you know what? You're going to have to call that plane and tell them to swing around and come and pick me up.
Great, people having sex, that's just what I need to see.
Ross.
Oh no, no, no. Oh God, you think I made out with him.
What?!
Yes, you're having a boy!
I know. I'm sorry.
Together?
Okay! Okay! Here!
Hey. Got a second?
Oh honey, I'm so sorry, you were right, this feels great!
No, no-no, it's okay, calm down. Mark and I talked, and I realised how much I love your stupid brother, and, yeah, we got our problems, but I really want to make it work.
Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....
No!!
You don't want to work for a guy like that.
Yeah.
Oops. Sorry! Well, good thing you number all of them, huh?
Hi, I'm sorry, I need to borrow your phone for just one minute.
I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too late.
Because, I can't! Ross, I told you, no. I can't.
Joey, how do you make that dirty?
Look at that!
Nothing.
Noooo... the interview! She loved me! She absolutely loved me. We talked for like two and a half hours, we have the same taste in clothes, andoh, I went to camp with her cousin... And, oh, the job is perfect. I can do this. I can do this well!
Yeah, she's...
Okay, okay, okay.
Oh, well, that shouldnt be so hard, now that youre dating. "Sweetheart, youre fired, but how bout a quickie before I go to work?"
Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?
Oh, okay, we're going. Yeah.
Thank you. Oh, cool! Free sample of coffee!
O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.
She's still with you?
What is it?
Oh what, my whole insane jealousy thing? Well, y'know, as much fun as that was, I've decided to opt for sanity.
Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she'd still be with us-nothing about an assistant buyer?
Come on.
Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?
I have one.
Wow! I mean I had no idea that that was gonna...
Yeah, okay, I'll see you later.
Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I'm doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I'm doing something that I'm actually good at. I mean. if you don't get that...
Okay, see? I told you!
Yeah?
Oh, y'know Joey, you are sick!
Yeah, whoosh!
You are asking me to be your wife!
Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?
Oh God, I really had a good time!
Yeah, but, there were no suds.
Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually , but now she's actually stealing you.
No!
Oh well, you don't want to do that now?!
No.
Yeah! It's an apothecary table. Does anyone even know what an apothecary is?
Well no, I don't smell anything.
Ohh, I'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt.
Oh y'know what, we don't have to talk about work. We can talk about anything!
I can't do this.
Yeah, at the lecture, I told you that last week, you said you didn't mind.
Okay, now what was that all about? Is it-does it not taste good? Let me try it.
Ooh, let's open them!
Hi. Listen, I was um, thinkin' about. . .
Okay, but before you go, could you help me first?
Tommy's supposed to be here soon, we're going to lunch.
Thanks!
Alright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecoming queen and the class president and you... were also there! But if you take this monkey, I will lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him. C'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here! Take it!
She'll be out in a second. So, Chip, how's umm, Amy Welch?
What about you honey, who would be on your list?
Hey you!
Bye. What a manipulative bitch.
Honey, listen, y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful.
Yeah.
Hi.
Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.
The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!
I'm funny? Oh thank God! Well hey, I've got a ton of these! Umm, oh hear-Do you want a good one? Here's a good one. Umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge. Right? And then you say to person, I bet you can't roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face. And then when they do it, they're left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face.
I'm not reading this!
Just a bug.
Yeah, 'cause that's why you won't get Isabella Rosselini, geography.
Are you drunk?!
Oh.
I'm off my break now so uh, um here you take this and um, I am gonna go pour these very nice people some coffee. Ok. Oh look at that, I don't have a pot. I don't have a pot. Well, hey, maybe I've got one at home, or in Scarsdale. Hey is that a door?
Well, look at that, same thing.
Well, I'll be waiting for you, just come up when you're done.
Noooo.
No! You gotta get me out of here Phoebe! These bargain shoppers are crazy!
What are you talking about Pheebs? I don't... Oh my God, you drew on me?!
Well, yeah! We're cool. Totally cool.
Okay, coming!
Wherever I go. Come on you and me, we'll-we'll start a new group, we're the best ones.
Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing? What am I doing? This is so un-me!
Come on you guys! What are doing?! I thought we were the patch sisters!
Okay come on Phoebe, it's nothing! Monica, come on!
Oh, please, Ross it was so obvious! It was like you were marking your territory. I mean you might have well have just come in and peed all around my desk!
Uhhh, yeah. But it's not obvious why.
Ohhh, yeah, me too.
OK, listen, I'm sorry about last night and I really want to make it up to you.
No! No! It's just that all the people in the entire world that I want to talk to are right here.
Ross's what?
It's not! I'm defrosting a chicken. Oh, I uh sold Mrs. Whiskerson.
Well, I assume I'll have to take showers with him, but y'know, that's true of any job.
The bll is drrbing!
Hi officer, was I going a little too fast?
Oh God, you saw me?! Oh!
What?
OK, gook luck.
Hi! I just wanna--Ahhh!!! Oh my God! Oh my God!
Well, isnt, isnt that gonna be weird?
Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
Well where's Amanda?
Yeah!
Okay, I'm sorry.
Yeah!
Oh yes, absolutely! Y'know, it's weird uh, but I had a dream last night where I was stopped by a policeman. And then he uh...well I probably shouldn't tell you the rest.
Wow.
Oh.... my God.
Umm, when were you gonna tell me that you're going out with Chip Matthews?
Yes.
Ohh. Oh, so you really wanted to learn. Yeah, y'know, Pheebs I just wanted to have fun. Ohh, you know who you should go with?
Really?
Ugh!
Okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay! I got it! I got it! I got it! I can't! I can't! I can't! I cannot go with you and my sister thing. Okay? I just can't. It's just too weird, all right? I imagine the two of you together and I freak out. It freaks me out. I can't do it! I can't do it.
Look, I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross but y'know, I've been obsessing about it all day and I'd just love not to talk about it. All right?
So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?
All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.
Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?
Yeah.
No Joe, no miracle.
So?
Yeah. Ahh, here's a box of your stuff.
No Ross!! Don't! You can't just kiss me and think you're gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesn't work that way. It doesn't just make it better. Okay?
Honey, what are you doing? That's too heavy.
She's actually very sweet and we used to be very close.
Well, he didn't say, but it was a fire. I'm guessing not very good. Come on, we gotta go!
Okay Joey, we're luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham?
Well, it'd better not be about the apartment pants, because I just pitched the idea to my boss at Ralph Lauren and she loved it.
Ross.
Oh God, even his knock is boring.
Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. Maybe we should actually move Rosita out of here. Y'know, start the heeling process?
Everybody...
Well, then I lost it. You buy me one!
What does she mean?
Nooo...
What?
All right. Be sexy.
Phoebe, you were right. I should've never gone to London, and from now on you make all of my decisions for me.
Oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too?
Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me! Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced tea. I'm getting pretty good at this!
Aww.
Well yeah, I wish that you would. Well, no it's not in there! How about that drawer?
Oh my God Phoebe! I mean I'm just-Wait a minute. If I'm your maid of honor that means you are Monica's.
Hey.
Yes?
No-no-no, no, honey please, I've got, I've just have so much to deal with.
Sorry-
Yeah.
Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person.
Hello! Ohh, kids love me.
OK.
Uhh, because I'm trying to play hard to get. Oh, quick he's looking over here, say something funny.
Yeah. Yeah, I-I-I see the scare. Listen, Paul, I think this is really great that-that y'know, you shared your feelings. It's really, it's beautiful, but umm, what do you say we go share some food?
We're not?!
No, I'm not.
Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.
What is the matter with you?!
No. Well, yeah, maybe.
Yeah, fair enough.
Well, then, I guess that's the difference between us. See, I'd never make a list.
Hi! Oh you guys look so beautiful!
Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
Yes okay. Well now see this isn't telling us anything. Joe. Carlos. Peter. Ooh! Peter Luger! T hat's a steak house!
Really?!
We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.
Just one drink?!
It's kinda slutty.
Yeah, we found them. There were in the guest room closet behind some coats.
Okay. What?! What are you doing here?!
Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!
Are you kidding?!
Yeah! That would be great!
And while I'm gone don't you boys sneak a taste.
OK, you wanna play? OK, let's play, let's play.
Ohh! And I'm one of them!! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!
Really?
