Oh is it?! Uhh, hello? Yes hi, is Rachel there? Yes she is, just one moment please. It's for me!
Oh, come on! This is crazy! Can't we just flip a coin?!
Just a bug.
No, the other thing. I really think it's great they work things out.
I need to talk to you!
Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts!
All right, first name on the speed dial is mom.
What are you saying?
Okay!
Sit down!
Yeah, I'm doing okay. I'm um...let's talk.
I'm so sorry.
All right, fine.
Hi. Listen, I was um, thinkin' about. . .
None.
Oh my God, they let you keep that stuff?!
Joey, would you just come out here and stop being such a baby!
No, no, no, I'm looking at a purchase order right here and it clearly states that we ordered the Rivera bikini in a variety of sizes and colours. And.... What does it matter, what I'm wearing?! Can I please speak to your supervisor? Thank you. We're holding.
Okay, uh...
What?!
Oh my God Ross! What in heaven's name are you doing here?
No! There's no orange juice in there! We win!!
Joey, what are you doing with the bag? You're audition is not until tomorrow.
Seriously, your dad doesn't like pranks.
Taurus?
I know you did! I bought the same one! And if she sees your table she's gonna know that I lied to her. I told her ours was an original.
Thank you, Okay, Okay.
Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor.
Yeah, there was. It was-there the corner of the library where-where all these dusty books that nobody ever read-Yes, there was.
Yeah! Ohh, I've been waitin' so long to get on that body!
Yeah. Look Joey, it's enough all right?! You keep making these stupid jokes and this sleazy innuendoes and it's-I'm not-it's just not funny anymore!
Did-did you come up here to work on that term paper or something?
Hey Ross? Umm, I just ran into Caitlin in the hallway and-and uh, you must be getting better at this flirting stuff than I thought.
That's weird, she locked the door.
Oh that's great!
Oh y'know what, we don't have to talk about work. We can talk about anything!
She's still with you?
Yeah! Yeah. They're...they're-they're my friends, uh, Monica Stephanopolus and uh, and Chandler Acidofolus.
Oh, yeah, sure, it's umm...
Okay! Okay! Umm, Webster's Dictionary defines marriage as... Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay, never mind! Forget it! Umm, umm, okay, uh... I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six year old.
Nooo!
Yeah.
It's left sweetie, but that's okay sweetie, that's a tough one.
Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.
Yeah, I'm good.
Well, I should think so. You slept with someone.
No-no-no! No-no-no! Please Ross, I can't! I can't do it! It's just gonna freak me out!!!
Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you're sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
Yeah!
Noo.
Is this a little too... Pheebs, what happened?
What?
Oh, if I only want two kids, can I keep him for another year?
Aw, I love that.
No! Come on its late, we're not gonna go down to the office.
You shouldn't.
I'm serious, I really, I think I need just to have some...meaningless, sex y'know, with the next guy that I see.
...we went back the house and we got really silly and we...we made out.
Yeah it is, mostly because I get to boss people around, which I just love to do.
What do you mean, you fold? Hey, come on! What is this? I thought that 'once the cards were dealt, I'm not a nice guy.' I mean, what, were you just full of it?
Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!
You don't have any secrets!
I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.
Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?
Yeah, it'll be fun. We'll run in the park. It'll be like our first y'know roommate bonding thing.
Ohh, well, this is just perfect!
You can?
Right! You're right!
Oh.
What are you? Monica!! Stop it!! Oh my God! Stop it!
Monica?!
All right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating Bob!
Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't know what that's for.
God I'm just a horrible person.
Oh well...
Hey! What happened to you? Why didn't you come up?
No! Oh what does he know! Come on Rosita, us chichas got to stick together! You bitch!
What's going on?
Well try to keep it down.
Do you?
Aww, Joey, come here. Look honey, I know this must be really, really difficult for you and I--Oh, I'm sorry. Am I hurting you?
Oh come on, I already went.
Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!
So, if-if I mess this up, there's nothing else for dessert?
Well now what's the rush?
Oh, honey, don't worry. She's gonna make it on time.
Well, I'd have to say gay.
What are you shushing?
Oh, yeah, well hey, welcome to our sauna.
Oh honey, I'm so proud of you, Min.
Hey, who's this little naked guy?
Who got married?!
What the hell was that?!
Yeah but, my assistant Tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch. Ohh! I could just spread him on a cracker.
Kinda.
For every night that you're asleep before I get home from work...
Okay, you are crazy! I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset! I mean, listen!
All right I know, I know how it looks Pheebs, but I'm telling you...
I'm Monica's maid of honor. Okay? Don't try to blue pin me!
She was kinda stupid. You're right. All right, I'm just gonna go on the date. I'm gonna go on the date. That is the new plan.
Hey!
What?!
Uh, I'm holding Ben.
Oh so-so not really never.
Closer than here?
All right. Fine.
Ross said my name. Okay? My name.
OK, then get me your purse.
Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right. I love you, but you're crazy.
No Joe, no miracle.
Oh my God! That's so great! I'm so happy for you guys!
She asked-asked you out again?
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh God.
Oh, it's a tattoo! That's weird, Phoebe doesn't... Wait that's Ursula! That's not Phoebe that is Ursula!
Hey.
No that could kill her.
Yeah.
All right, that's it, you guys! What happened out there?
Ugh! I cannot believe Chip dumped me for that slut Nancy Branson. I am never going out with him again. I don't care how much he begs!
What did, what did he say?
Oh, what are you going to do?! Are you gonna go run tell Monica?! Are you gonna tell Joey?! No! Because then you will have to tell them what we did! We are desert stealers! We are living outside the law!
Hello!
Yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means Joey.
Umm, honey, look he just came over to....
I am so proud of Joey, I can't believe he's going to be on Law & Order!
Ow! Ross!!
Okay.
Yeah!
But honey he calls everybody by a nickname! Okay, look, I know, all right, just one dinner, please, just one night for me, please. I just want him to love you like I do. All right, well not exactly like I do, but, but, if you do come to dinner, I'll love you like I do in that black thing that you like.
Well, why shouldn't I be? I have great friends! I have a wonderful job!
Right.
Oh! That's fine.
Ok, so let's talk money.
Bye, Pheebs.
I don't gossip!
We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.
No Paul, I don't know anything about you! Y'know, like-like your childhood! Tell me about your childhood!
Well, I, umm...
Oh, did you not want people to know that?
Really? How good?
Saving, saving, saving me from the pleasant conversation with the interesting man, saving me?
I see your fifty cents... and I raise you... five dollars.
I don't know, you tell me. One minute I'm holding Ben like a football, the next thing I know, I've got two kids, I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about the taxes.
Okay, I heard that.
Really? Me?
HI!! Hi!
Oh-oh Professor Geller.
I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?
Why aren't you at work?
Noo!!
I, I didn't say any... I sw... I did not say anything, I swear. He stopped by.
Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship! But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him! Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest! Okay, you go!
All right. Okay Chandler, enjoy your handful.
Yeah.
Well, so what does he do?
Yeah!
With ah, extra anchovies.
From now?
Well, then talk!
Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'...
Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her.
I'm so glad, I'm so glad you shared. And I'm glad that you're done. What do you say we umm...
So what?! Y'know what? The way I see it--Ow! Son of a bitch!!
What? It's true, my right leg is two inches shorter.
Yeah, I mean, you know it, I mean, if it were me I, I, you know, I'd want you to, I don't know, like catch me off guard, you know, with like a really good kiss, you know really, sort of um, soft at first, then maybe um brush the hair away from my face, and look far into my eyes in a way that let's me know that something amazing is about to happen.
But we should move quick.
Well look, if you don't like this...
We're paying for this y'know.
Oh, come on! He's glad that I came, he doesn't want me to go anywhere, balls flying all over the place!
Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex. "Was it good for you?"
Ohh, whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on please hurry up honey! Please?
Hey!
Whoa-oh, what's-what's that?
Well, y'know, sometimes that helps.
Yeah and you stretch 'em out with your big old clown feet.
I don't know, you thought 'See you Saturday' was funny. Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with. You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.
Really?
That was not funny!
I know.
Ohhhh!! ...What? What?
No, I haven't had a chance to be alone with him yet.
A birthday party.
Oh.... my God.
How could you not tell me that she has hair?
I will wake you up in a way that's proved very popular in the past.
What?! No! I'm not gonna move out!
Phoebe's dead.
My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce. But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them. But you know what, you know what the good news is? I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours.
Anyway, there's this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren bought a table, so I kinda have to go...
Oh, Phoebe, are you still on hold? I was supposed to call my Dad back like two hours ago.
So, is this just gonna be you and Carol?
What?
Well no, I don't smell anything.
My boss, Joanna? Wow, that must've been awkward.
Oh my God, its happening. It's already started. I'm Kip.
Whoa, look at you, you did pretty well.
OK, OK. I'm with you, Cheech. OK.
Mon you definitely have to make it a theme wedding, and the theme could be, "Look how much money we've got!" Y'know, I mean you could put, you could put money in-in the invitations! You-you could have like little money place settings. And ah, you could start with a money salad! I mean it'll be dry, but people will like it.
You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.
Well umm, maybe we could uhh... Ah-ha! Too slow!!
Would you like to go to a basketball game with me? You know, its funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets too... Umm, who likes the Knicks-
Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that? Especially you!
And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.
Ross kissed me.
To be nice.
Bye.
What?! What?! My birthday's not for another month!
This one?
You stole them from me!!
Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing.
What? Guys, I'm not.
Okay? Whoa, wait!
So this is Brooklyn.
Why.
Ahh, yes, I will have a glass of the Merlot and uh, he will have a white wine spritzer. Woo! Hey, look at that, the airport's moving. Hey, are we moving?! Are we moving? Why are we moving? Hey, time-out, umm, yeah, does the captain know that we're moving? Oh my God. Oh, my gosh.
OK, well, bye-bye again.
Hey Pheebs.
No luck huh?
Rub it.
They had to have that specially made?!
What's this?
I don't have ten minutes!!
Hi!
Not interested.
Ross! Janice?!
Okay.
Charming.
Monica, what are you talking about?
Yes! Did you see that?
Yeah... I, uhh... I have a... I have a date.
Ross thanks.
Yeah, 'cause that's why you won't get Isabella Rosselini, geography.
Ooh, I like those sunglasses.
I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me.
All right listen umm, I just bought something I'm not sure she's gonna like it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that I wanted since I was a little girl.
Gunther, I quit.
Oo, I can't watch this, it's like Sophie's Choice.
Cappuccino.
Whoa what?
Yeah!
Of course I clean it. I mean, I,I will cleeeean it. I mean, I will cleeeean it.
Okay honey, you can finish this later we're gonna be late. We gotta go.
Thank you. I...yeah.
Ohh, God! Look at him, he's so cute. I wanna go over there, grab him, and kiss him! How can I kiss him and not letting him know that I like him?
Ow!
Okay, fine. Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why I'm a terrible waitress? Because, I don't care. I don't care. I don't care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don't care where the tray spot is, I just don't care, this is not what I want to do. So I don't think I should do it anymore. I'm gonna give you my weeks notice.
I thought I was making him filet mignon?
Oh God! This is silly, I'm gonna see you in a couple of hours!
Ugh! Get out! Get out! Go! Come on! No! Not in there! He's in there!
I think I just shipped 3,000 bras to personnel. Oh honey, I gotta go. Mark, I need you!
Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that's why you have got to be the bigger man here.
No, you know what, I think you should go.
Well, I did my best to convince him that I'm not some crazy girl who is dying to get married-I'm just going through a hard time.
Uh, I don't know. Why don't you put it right here next to my water?
Hi! I just wanna--Ahhh!!! Oh my God! Oh my God!
So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by the time we're 40, we get married. I mean, we know each other, we like each other, and we've-we've already slept together so y'know there'll be no surprises there! You know what I mean? No like, "What's that?!"
Seriously, it's moving!
Now just how big of a star is Marcel?
No! So I can be by myself. Y'know? Have a little alone time.
Ross? Look, whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants, just give it to her. Come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. So just fix whatever she wants fixed. Just do it. I mean, you're gonna have to try. You'll just gonna hate yourself if you don't. Oh come on answer it! It's driving me crazy!
Wait, but there's no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!
Ahhhh!!
'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.
Oh no-no-no-no-no, no, no! We, you with someone and me with someone.
Luisa? Oh my God! Monica! It's Luisa!
Mmm-hmmm. Oh, so typical. Ooo, I'm a man. Ooo, I have a penis. Ooo, I have to win money to exert my power over women.
Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything.
I don't know, I don't know, weren't you the guy that told me to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!!
Oh, that's funny!
Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided thisthis whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea.
Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!
Well. Woah, look at that! I gotta go, I gotta date. With a man. Um, OK, you guys have a really, uh, have a really good night and you two have a, uh, have a, uh, really good cat. OK, we're not supposed to take these when we leave.
Oh, god.
Oh. Right.
Um, Russ, you ready?
Oh yeah? Another night of birdogging the chickas?
Yeah!
Oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!!!
Oh my God.
What?
With Ross and my sister?
By all means.
You really, really need to get some sleep, honey.
I know. I'm sorry. Look, I'll make a deal with you all right? Okay?
Yeah, oh wait!
Yeah.
Okay, that's gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest?
Ow!
Guess what?
This bench, it's hollow! I can't believe I never knew that! Oh, the presents!!!
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a girl?
Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!
Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey.
Oh yeah.
Uh-hmm.
She's right. She's right. You are no different than the rest of them.
Yeah, we're, we're actually just gonna walk 'cause it's right up there at the Angelica.
So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?
Yeah, just give me a minute! Oh well, yes, I can think of one good thing.
So Joey I just hooked Ross and Chandler up with some tuxedos for the wedding, do you need one?
Good. Although y'know, he-he's a private guy. Y'know, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.
What is it?
Tell him.
Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Monica, number one, I don't think Ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, I... What?!
Oh, wait and on the nineteenth a secret crush announces itself.
I was laughing! You made me laugh!
Ohh, you've waited soo long.
God, he's good.
You just said it!
Ohh! You did not drop any socks!
Right!
Yeah, why?
Really! God Ross, what were you thinking? I know it's really shallow, but a part of me wants him again.
Fine.
Your sunglasses?!
Bye Mon.
Hey. Whe-ell, look at you, finally got that time machine workin' huh?
Oh it's OK. You were worth the wait, and I don't just mean tonight.
No, I know, they're from me. Look you guys this is not good. I mean we have enough trouble with guys stealing our wind without taking it from each other.
We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it's actually for Joshua. Look, he said he's not ready to date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I have the perfect opportunity to seduce him!
Ehhh, no, I wanna do Phoebe's thing.
You're a pathetic loser, right?
Yeah, this is Tag. Tag, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
But I told you, I didn't have the time!
Bob Buttons?
She has got so much going on we-we have only two options. We have Friday...
Right.
Whoa, wait, listen, I think I'm just gonna talk to Ross about what he think it meant.
I know. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. All right, this is what we're gonna do, we are gonna go to the next highest bidder, and we are just gonna let them buy it, and then you're just gonna pay the difference.
Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend!
Well, they always called.
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh Chandler!! You guys are gonna be so happy!
OK.
Aren't you a little cute to be a doctor?
That yeti is one smooth talker.
Pam! Oh God okay, just imagine this, "The Pam."
Ohhh... Okay, you were right. You were right! This was just not worth it.
Oh no, you're the best.
What, as part of your poor friends outreach program?
I'm okay.
Tommyyyy! Say, what's your favourite thing about summer?
I mean, it's a cat, y'know, it's a cat. Why can't they get one of those bugs, y'know, one of those fruitflies, those things that live for like a day or something? What're they called, what're they called, what're they called?
Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special.
What-what-what are you gonna do?
I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that.
Bye you guys!
I... Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for?
Yeah, she's gay.
Okay.
Eww!
Okay, go to the left. The left!
Hey! You guys umm, I want you to meet Sebastian.
You guys are really right...there aren't you?
Y'know what? No. It's not over until someone says, "I do."
Nobody.
Uh-hmm, uh-hmm, yeah, yeah, I really liked your hands.
Y'know Marcel?
Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you.
Uh-huh. No, I hear what you're saying and-and-and that makes a lot of sense but can I just say one more thing? Look how pretty!
All right.
Why, why not?
Nooo Way! The most romantic song ever is The Way We Were.
Okay, now what was that all about? Is it-does it not taste good? Let me try it.
Ross, honey, is there anything we can do?
Joey!
Um-hmm, yeah.
Well, I was gonna let you play with it.
Hit me!
Well, maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I pass that information on y'know kinda like a public service, it doesn't mean I'm a gossip. I mean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip?
Oh, come on!
Yes! Totally!
No! I mean come on! This is a huge deal! Fine I want-I need more details, who-who initiated the first kiss?
Yeah, I-I don't care.
All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!
Hi honey!
I can't believe I don't get to go to my own prom, this is so harsh.
Honey, you're not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives.
Well, I-I guess-I...
I know, yeah, sorry.
Oh, thank goodness!
Joey, did you my face cream?
Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?
There you go!
I don't know!
Right...
No no no no no. You wanted me to take them down, so... ..Im takin em down. Okay? Whoa!
Ross!
You want me to just call him up and tell him that you're seeing him instead? That's what you want?
I know!
Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?
Nothing. I don't want to do anything.
Y'know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding, it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.
I did.
Oh, thank God.
What?
Joey, had reasons.
Uh-huh! Nice try, but you don't get that chair anymore! All right? That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap! No I take that back!
Yes, we should. I think we should.
He carries a briefcase.
Oh thank you, Chandler, this is so great, she's gonna love me.
Will you stop calling it your apartment!
What is that noise?
Oh honey, this is his office too. I told you we're Joanna's two assistants.
Hey. Got a second?
Yeah fun? Great! So uh, so did you guys hit it off?
Well, you know, no suds, no save.
Oh well, y'know, the gala had to end sometime.
I am not gonna get fired, because I'm not gonna act on it.
Hi Pheebs.
Thank you. Thank you. I love you.
Thank you. Mon?
I am. Let me just get my coat.
Um-hmm.
Okay, but before you go, could you help me first?
: So basically, you get your ya-yas by taking money from all of your friends.
Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming!!
Hello?! Oh, yeah! This is gonna be a while. Excuse me. Yeah!
Yeah. Gotcha.
And?
All right Ross!! I get it!!
Ok honey, you really need a job.
Yeah! Closure. That's what it is, that's what I need. God, you're brilliant! Why didn't I think of that? How do I get that?
Who is it?
I know!
Yeah! Y'know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, I have wondered whether I made the right choice. And now I know.
Well what happened at dinner?
Goodbye, baby.
Surprise!!
Oh my God!
Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.
Okay.
Okay. All right, I see what he's doing! He's not asking me out, because he wants me to ask him out.
Oh my God you stole her award!
Oh.
No honey, okay, okay, you wanna know why Ross canceled the date? Because I asked him to.
Just sit over there!!
So what happens next?
Come on, it's a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasn't smoked since.
Yes, but you can not tell Ross 'cause I want to surprise him.
Okay, umm, I'm gonna get my sweater.
Oh! Good thing Chandler's not here, he always wins at this game.
Hi!
Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.
What? Wh-hey!
Oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do?
Okay.
Oh Mom!
Mm-mmm.
Can I see you in my office for a minute?
What?!!
You don't know?!
Oh!
Oh, come on! We know what these are worth.
Thank you! You're great!
No.
Joey...
Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good.
These are, these aren't for you. These are for you. Welcome to our country.
I got the job!
Really?
Hi!
What?
Hmm.
Y'know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding, it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.
I accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back y'know of course, 'cause "Let's bring the girl back who kisses everybody!"
Aw.
Oh, I know, I know, it's-it's so, it's so totally like, "Whoa! Can we do this?" Y'know, I mean, but I mean it just feels right! Don't you think? It does! I mean, it just feels right, don't you think?
Well, what happened to your jam plan?
Oh yeah, scared the hell out of me. I thought we'd lost you forever. Pheebs, you lie down?
Yeah, I can do that.
Really?! How do you know?
Ross!! Oh my--ugh!! You kept count?! You are such a loser!
Uh, I don't have any brothers so I don't know, but uh, did you guys wrestle?
Hey Joey, can I...
See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened? He got phased out!
Okay?
Uhh, because I'm trying to play hard to get. Oh, quick he's looking over here, say something funny.
Yeah, right, he almost danced me right down that...garbage chute.
Well, alright, then, forget it. Might as well just go home. Ow ow ow ow!
No, I meant with the dropper over here.
Yay!
Ohh! It's so nice to meet you. Hello.
Uh-huh.
So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.
Tell her to wear her own earrings.
No.
I'm an assistant buyer!!
OH MY GOD!!! Sorry, I was just imagining what it'd be like to catch the money bouquet.
Monica! I couldn't find him for two hours! He was having sex with Amy Welch!
Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me! Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced tea. I'm getting pretty good at this!
Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!
Yeah, well that's how mad I am!!
What?
Huh. Well, y'know that's actually a really good idea, because that way they'll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too.
Storming out!
Good.
Oh, hi!
Arghh!!
Yeah.
What?
leave...
No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex.
Oh, okay, we're going. Yeah.
Okay.
Well, that's great.
I'd do anything for you, you know that.
No, I know, but Ihe just went on. He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just...
Ohh that's nice.
So you'll definitely get onstage, even if you don't win.
Oh, hi!
I'm just making margaritas.
What?!
Ohh, so no sign of Emily huh?
Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?!
Well, ever since I was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends, I'm just, I don't know, not in a museum benefitty kind of mood.
Wow! H-umm! Hi! Yes, uh I'm sorry the models are actually down the hall.
She's actually very sweet and we used to be very close.
Yeah, I got that.
Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.
Hey! Oh right, tonight was your party.
Come on, I don't really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying a very heavy couch.
Let's do it! Ross?
Okay. Okay!
Yes, I'll meet 'em.
What? This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is not-that's-that's not what it is. See, see, okay, I work in fashion, see and-and, this is a real dress actually. It's-it's, they're-they're wearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how people respond, and then I report back to my superiors at Bloomingdale's, so... And obviously in uh, in-in this case, I am going to report back, "USA not ready."
No! I'm so happy for them!
Oh my God! Calling from Rome! Bon giorno, caro mio.
Hey!
Hey, I thought that guy was married.
Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him-
Are you over me?
There's more alcohol, right?
I am not a baby! You know what? I swear to god, just because you get so uptight every time we...
But Joey you don't have $20,000!
Actually, what I think you said was, "don't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen."
Ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married.
Men just take out wind?
You!
Okay.
Okay. I am so hot!
How can you not remember us kissing?!
We... We are not... ...going to let it... be a problem.
Sorry. Sorry.
And I will see you tomorrow!
I'm gonna marry someone good y'know.
Oh, I don't know. I don't know.
Um... Ross?
Oh, come on Ross! I think it would be really good for you!
Do you want my pickle?
Oh no, I'm sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I saw you.
Pheebs?
Thanks for lunch, Chandler. Y'know, you didn't have to walk me all the way back up here.
Do you want to put the book in the freezer?
Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
Hello, Mrs. Chatracus.
You had to do it, didn't you? You couldn't just leave it alone.
Okay. Uh, want something-want something to drink?
What?! Chandler, what is the matter with you?!
You went shopping?! What, and then you just came in here and paraded it right under Jill's nose when you know she's trying to quit. Wow, you guys are terrible!
OK... see your two... and I raise you twenty.
Oh, y'know what? I can't. I have to have dinner with that Melissa girl.
Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?!
Good ones?
Okay. Okay.
Oh, Ross, I'm sorry. I completely ruined your evening.
Hey, this is hollow.
Oh.
Okay.
So did you read your evaluation yet?
Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does. But I have to tell him how I feel! He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.
Well y'know, it's you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff! Y'know? I mean, you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! I guess I'm not upset because I don't see you guys going through with it. I'm sorry.
The bll is drrbing!
Hey, guys, what's up.
Still in love with?!
Ohhh!!!
Umm, well let's see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw.
Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!
Yes okay. Well now see this isn't telling us anything. Joe. Carlos. Peter. Ooh! Peter Luger! T hat's a steak house!
So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up, so Ross selflessly, offered to take me.
Yeah. Hmmmm.
Okay, here we go. I'm Jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird look on your face. What? Honey, what is it? Did I get it wrong? Did I get the hair wrong? What? Did you just picture it differently? What? What?
Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick- you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
This Alan again? How's it goin'?
You think I trust you with it?! No! We're gonna split it! You take half and I take half!
Right...
Well those are very popular frames.
What? You're leaving?!
Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?
Yeah, love. It's a tricky business isn't it?
Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once. But I mean that's a classic, what's so great about The Shining?
Monica, betting the apartment, I don't know about this.
Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.
Oh, you are losing. Definitely losing.
It's worse than the thumb!
Oh... Oh, Pheebs.
Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!
Oh honey, I'm so sorry, you were right, this feels great!
Y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out...
Honey.
Cats, how long do they live figuring you don't... y'know, throw 'em under a bus or something?
Yeah, y'know what? I'm-I'm gonna meet you upstairs in a minute.
Hm-mmm.
Yes.
Where are you going?
Shake it off.
Hi!
Hey!
Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?
Both of you?
Yeah but-but-but you liked me! Oh my God, I can't believe this, all this time, I liked you and you liked me!
Well then you're going to have to take her out again.
What?
Do you even know who Kip is?
Yes?!
Hi. Sorry, things aren't working out so well.
Do you really not know where I'm going with this? It left! It's one huge room!
Um... Done!
Ross, you're like my best friend.
But Pheebs, y'know you earned it.
Okay, do you see, do you see what you're keeping me married too?!
Yeah, it's in there.
Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.
I don't know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it'll die.
Op.
What-what?! You're gonna leave this person with me?!
Yes I did! And I put a little Post-It on it that said, "Must go out today," and underlined today three times and, and then I put a little heart in the corner because I didn't want to seem to bossy.
So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?
Assistant buyer. Oh! I would be shopping... for a living!
So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?
Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?
Oh wow! This is so cool.
Fine.
I don't know, y'know? I feel a little umm... No, y'know what? Nevermind, I'm gonna be fine.
Well, I have to be, I don't really have a choice, I mean, you know, I could look at the bright side, I get two birthday parties and two birthday cakes.
Look, I cannot do this right now, okay, I've got a deadline, would you just go home, I'll talk to you later.
Oh! I've got a lot of those too!
How's Ross doing? Y'know since all the Emily stuff.
Why?
What?
"Pheebs, can't make it, got a date. Talk to you later. Big Daddy." Big Daddy?
I don't know.
How are you?
What was the book?
Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no, that's OK, I don't need them. I'm going for fours.
Oh wow. That-y'know what? That is so unfair. Y'know what? Now I want to steal your thunder! Come on Ross, let's go have sex!
From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.
No way, forget it.
All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!
Show cat! Quality show cat! Show cat!
I'm-I'm sorry, I just thought that...
Ohhhhh, don't be mad...
Maybe it's not as bad as I think. Y'know, maybe they didn't take it the way I meant it.
Hi!
Ya, know what Barr, I'm not gonna leave. I probably should, but I'm not, see 'cause I promised myself that I would make it through at least *one* of your weddings . See now, tonight, all I really wanted was to make it though this evening with a little bit of grace and dignity. Well , I guess we can all agree that's not gonna happen. There's nothing really left to say except.... "Her name was Lola. She was a showgirl. With yellow feathers , feathers in her hair, and a dress cut down to there. She would..."
Okay, oh, here's what you do. Just act like everything around you turns you on.
It is? Really?
I'm not in love with Ross!
Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?
Hi!
Oh my God! Why is he jumping on those women!
Good bye!
Then what's with all the bananas?
Well, I'll ask him for you, if you want me too?
Well, you know, honey, I don't think everybody gets Smelly Cat. You know, I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh!
And um, excuse me, he helps me.
'Gone for more jars. Back later. Monica Geller.'
Oh, I did!
Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that I don't get.
Barry?!
Ooh, it was only okay.
Do you guys ever get the feeling that um, Chandler and those guys just don't get that we don't make as much money as they do?
Well you uh, you were always really good at the uh, at the uh the stuff.
I don't even know how I would go about it.
Wha...
Yeah, oh my God, tomorrow! That, no, it's perfect. Oh God, thank you soo much. Great! Bye! I got the interview!
Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.
Well, you would know.
Hi you guys!
Yes! I will! Absolutely! Hello, Rachel. Hi, Joshua. I left my wallet here on purpose. Really? Yes, I just wanted to see you again. Oh, I'm glad. Rachel, I'd like to say something to you. Yes? How you doin'?
Beefsteak Charlie's?
Oh God Monica hi! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
Um... my... father.
All right, would-would you mind just not going out with him again? Okay, just the idea of you and he and all these women, it's just-And I know he's my assistant and I can't date him-but it just bothers me, all right?!
There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course.
Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!! Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey! Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just-y'know-stop it!
Ohh...
Okay, bye-bye!
That is the sweetest thing, I just....
Ohh, great!
His new girlfriend!
Do you got your gracious loser face?
I had a bra.
Yeah, and you don't mind if I call, because you only want good things for me.
Yeah?
No no no, wait, I wanna see what happens.
Oh, it's just like a bloodbath in here today.
C'mon, I'm not saying it was a bad movie, I'm just saying, you know, it was a little. . . hard to follow.
Really?
Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about you...
No. No, you can't.
What happened?
Yeah that works.
What?
I don't know!
Are you pregnant?!
I'll be right there! Okay, Ross, please come on! I thought we have moved on! I thought we've gotten to a place where we could be happy for each other! I mean was that just me?
No! Nothing!
Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
Well isn't it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy and that I can get a lot of use out of?
Noooooooo!!
Yeah!
Oh yeah? Fine.
Yes it is!
No, I think that was the whole all.
Oh no.
Well, I'm sorry, I thought you needed them!
Chandler!
Three of your five, what?
Ohh! Okay!
Oh, slides. So really nothing happened.
Oh. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. Sorry. It's just, I'm ahh, I'm kinda excited. I'm, ahh, going to London to ahh, tell this guy that I love him and...
Really?
Are they in love?
Wow! This is great! Look at all these cups! This is so weird.
Oh! Hi you guys, oh my God! You'll never gonna believe happened to me today! I am sitting in my office and...
Okay.
Wow! You certainly think a lot of yourself.
Wow! I don't know if I could ever do that. I always figured the first time I had a baby was with somebody I love and that baby would be a...keeper.
So, come on, what was the big news Pete wanted to tell you Mon?! Or should I say Mrs. Monica Becker?
Anyway, speaking of drinking too much. I was uh, tellin' Phoebe about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and I uh, we made out.
Wh-what?!
Oh, yeah, I'm not, I'm not hungry.
14?
Oh, Joey! Sorry!
Well, look at that, same thing.
Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?
All right, it's okay. One little setback is okay, just don't let it happen again, all right? Now since daddy paid for all this stuff, I should take it all away. But I'm just gonna take the-the pajmena. And the uh, and the uh pants. Y'know what, I'm just gonna take it all away, 'cause that way you'll just really learn the lesson. Okay? All righty, I'm gonna run a couple of errands and I will see you at dinner.
Oh no-no, no! It's good! It's all good! I-I actually work at Ralph Lauren!
: Sak's... Fifth... Avenue.
Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.
Right.
Hey.
Oh no, at the Grammies I always win.
Hey... hi, ladies... uh, can I get you anything? : Did you bring the mail?
Oh, it ended very well.
Oh, me too.
That's crazy! You can't do that! What are you going to tell her? Oh God. Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you?
No, actually first they started on my waist. And then, they slid up, and then, they were in my hair.
Oh good. Ahhh! My God, sorry!
Yeah me too.
Yeah?
Well how can that be, you were just kissing Sabrina?
I got-I get a big pay raise!
Okay!
Hey he's wearing a sweater.
You just did a little dancy thing.
Well, actually, I meant for me. The hiring committee is meeting people all day and...
Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
Show time!
What? What?!
Well I...
Well, I don't know. I called all the people in Monica's phone book and these are the only ones who could show up on 24 hours notice.
Oh, I beg to differ. The Pictionary incident?
Anyway, I'm going to be the coordinator of the woman's collection, I'll work right under the director, it's the perfect, perfect job for me!
Oh, can we read them?
I meant, me plus one!
Hey, Sophie!
Really? You think so?
You think you're gonna get out of this on a technicality?
Oh, but y'know, no, you didn't give me your phone number.
Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July.
Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.
What are you reading?
Okay!
Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!
Okay, here we go...
Yeah. I'm-I'm telling you he's really sweet and he's really funny and he's just ugh, got a good heart. And besides, I y'know, I think he really likes you.
No-no-no, no, honey please, I've got, I've just have so much to deal with.
You like me?
Rossy, Rossy.
Okay.
Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan.
Well, yeah! I'm still pursuing that.
Because, he's my friend.
Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him.
But I don't, hmm... Oh, who approved that order?! Well there is no Mark Robbinson in this office. Get me Mark on the phone!
Honey, I'm just checking.
Oh my God! Listen to you talkin' about having kids. Oh my Joey. Oh, please don't get married before I do.
What?!
Yeah and there's really cute guys there.
Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! Every place I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. I mean, look at this; "Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." It's just, there is nothing! The city's full!
No, Phoebs. I'm dating Russ.
Rome. Jerk missed his flight.
Well, at least that's a great suit.
Ohhh! Well of course I will watch him! We have fun, don't we Ben?
Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house.
Close call day.
Oh, I don't know. I guess we have to eat.
Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend.
I know, isn't he great? It's so nice to finally be in a fun relationship, y'know? There's nothing boring about him, and ah, I bet he's never set foot in a museum.
Who is it?
"Indeed there isn't"... I should really get back to work.
Ohh, okay, how about five. Ohh, thank you.
Okay.
Hi Joey, how ya doin'?
Oh my God.
Okay, you gotta give me some of your piece.
Are you sure?
Well, things change.
Okay..Okay.. Look. I'm sorry that I lied to you before. You were right. Ralph and I were an item but were not anymore.
I'll help you throw out your purse.
No! They didn't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems?
Hi.
Hello, excuse me.
Ok, Ok, Pheebs...
And your fly's still open...
Oh my God.
Oh... I'm sorry. I... I-I don't mean-I didn't mean to stifle you. I... This is all just a little overwhelming.
Yes, you're having a boy!
Oh.
Get your hands out of there! No!
Whatever Linus, I'm opening mine.
Yeah?
I'm sorry, sweetie.
Okay. So, can I serve you a little of-What? What? What?
Her dancer friends?
The thing is y'know, that you're married to Emily.
Yes!!
Does anybody want anything else?
Oh, I know, I'm sorry you guys. You're just gonna have to get used to the fact that I will not be dating Ross.
Yes, and I know that you'd say no if he asked you, but I'm sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin.
Oooooh. : Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview!
All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.
Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like, everything. And for what?
Joey, you can't keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him.
You think about stuff like that?
Okay, Chandler!
Pheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened!
That is the Coast Guard.
Okay, y'know what? Maybe I should go!
Oh! Look what happened! {Don't get your hopes up guys, we only get to see her from the back or from the neck up. Its times like these I wish that the networks would broadcast some nudity other than Denis Franz's butt.} Huh, check me out! I'm in my kitchen...naked! I'm picking up an orange. I'm naked! Lighting the candles, naked, and carefully.
Oh my God! Joey!
Yeah!
It's a, it's a cat!
Yes.
Oh no-no-no don't say but! No-no, but's never good! Let's just leave it at, you like me and I like you.
You found me a guy?
Ross! Come on! That's all right! Fine--Okay, I have a weird thing about my eye. Can we not talk about it please?
Definitely! Phoebe, you will not find a single game show host, who's ass I cannot kick.
Oh, you are a petty man. You are a petty, petty....
Yeah.
No. And then I called him, and he wasn't there.
Remember when we were in high school together?
Yeah, he broke those too.
Hi Russ, I've just got two more tables to clean and then we'll go, OK?
Oh, that is so sweet. I think I'm falling in love with you all over again.
No. No.
Ohhh!
I'm gonna go get one of those job things.
I don't think so.
Wh, Ross what do you want from me? You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?
Okay fine! I'll-I'll just tell her it's an antique apothecary table, she doesn't have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at this little drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs.
Oh.
Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you're, you're, you're making this too hard.
Ugh.
Take it like a man, Ross!
No.
I don't think so.
Wait, what am I gonna do?
Yeah, but, there were no suds.
Oh no! No! It's actually-it's very sweet. It's very sweet. Look! Yeah, do you want it?
You were gonna drink the fat.
Okay.
That was surreal. Okay, what do think? Are you interested at all?
Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!
You guys, does this look like something the girlfriend of a paleontologist would wear?
Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua's gone so you and Emily are free to go.
Oh no, no, no. Oh God, you think I made out with him.
Pheebs? Could you get that? Please?
Hi!
Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!
Okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay! I got it! I got it! I got it! I can't! I can't! I can't! I cannot go with you and my sister thing. Okay? I just can't. It's just too weird, all right? I imagine the two of you together and I freak out. It freaks me out. I can't do it! I can't do it.
Noooo... the interview! She loved me! She absolutely loved me. We talked for like two and a half hours, we have the same taste in clothes, andoh, I went to camp with her cousin... And, oh, the job is perfect. I can do this. I can do this well!
What? Wait, what?
Okay? Wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please? I mean tell me that you like him.
What?
What? Wait! Why...why do you get the story?
Really?
Uh-huh.
And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!
Ross, no! There is no way I am leaving this room looking like this!
Oh! Yay! Look! There's a piece that doesn't have floor on it!
Awful, absolutely awful.
Uh-huh.
Well! Is everybody else having just the best time?!
Thank you. Hey-hey umm, uh, is there, is there any such thing as an annulment shower?
Rachel.
Wow! What do you do now?
But y'know, I could use a hand getting ready.
Oh.
How come you are?!
No. Oh, oh, I guess it would be different if I were- with somebody.
Oh, Phoebe, do I wanna hear this?
Uhhhooo.
OK, you wanna play? OK, let's play, let's play.
Hey. Oh, I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of the other two guys to go out with, who would you pick?
Ohhh, OK.
Why would you even want to come Ross? You're a horrible skier.
I bet he sensed that I was ready to have sex with another guy.
Oh Joey, I'm sorry I just couldn't tell her all those things you wanted me to tell her. And y'know we got to talking and I...
Hey, Pheebs, quick question for ya.
Oh! Well let's look for them. Oh-oh-hey! Are these them?
Wh... Come on! Remember? We were on the sleeping porch! We couldn't stop giggling? And our coconuts kept knockin' together?
Yeah. Who's workin' for you babe?
Yeah.
I don't know, I don't know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break.
Bye, Chandler.
What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.
Ooh, your brother. Score!
Guess!
What? I was just trying to teach you.
Ok, I just, I just really need to be with myself right now. I'm sorry.
Hey!
Fine! I judged you. I made a snap judgement. But you did it too! And you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! You can't even open up your mind for a second to see if you're wrong! What does that say about you?
I mean he just started going out with her.
Oh there is no way.
No don't! Go back to repeating!
Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I've ever heard.
Hey!
Yeah, and also we need more umm, drinks. Hold on a second. Whup, okay. Hello! Vegas? Yeah, we would like some more alcohol, and y'know what else? We would like some more beers. Hello? Ohh, I forgot to dial!
Look, If I don't get to London!! He is going to marry that other girl!!!
I don't know! I mean, we still care about each other. There's a history there. 'S'like you and Carol.
Boy, you really can't stand to lose, can you? Your whole face is getting red... little veins popping out on your temple...
Just get out! Now!!
That sounds great.
It'll never last, he's just a rebound roommate.
Hi.
Oh. That's so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, 'Where's number 27?!'
Bye. What a manipulative bitch.
No! Don't say that! Don't say that!
Oh my...
Yeah! It's weird. But the thing is need to find a date.
Right.
Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!
Oh, I'm sorry. Ross Tillman.
Hi! Okay, don't be mad at me, but I couldn't resist.
Oh. Yes! I would so move out!
Ohhhhhhhh God.
Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean, what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats?
No....
Okay!
Hey, how'd it go?
Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but we're gonna have to get into Mr. Zelner's office. Now, he doesn't get in until 10, so he's no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.
Oh!
Huh-Wait so Joey if you get this, you're gonna be like the star of your own TV show! I mean you'll be like the Big Cheese! Or the Big Mac-Hey! You love those!
Ohh! Right! Right, sorry, I'll be right back!
Joey, y'know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.
I'll do it.
Yeah that's great Paul, but y'know I wanna know what--Wow, those are really great! I just wanna know what, what is behind this-this strong, silent exterior. Y'know they say that still waters run deep and I wanna swim in yours.
Mira, Mira, el viejo desnudo est haciendo el hula hoop!
Take the top down did ya?
Oh.
Yeah well unless we tell him.
Oh yeah!
Are you okay? You're not blinking.
Oh, are you sure you're ok?
You do?
You know what else I'm not gonna miss? "I'm Monica. I wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!"
And I-I am just trying to figure out why.
Who?
Okay, hold on just a second. I'm sorry, it's for human resources, everybody has to do it. Could you just stand up please?
She'll be a much better friend when the market closes.
Really?!
What's the matter?
I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Umm, maybe you can start with, "Chandler, even though we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more."
Oh, hi.
Look at you, you are so big I can't believe it!
Pheebs, I was wondering...
Come on!
Okay. I'm sorry. You're right, you're right.
Really!
Oh, I gotta get back to work.
Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants.
So did you break up with Joanna?
No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.
God, I am so glad you don't have a problem with this, because if you did, I wouldn't even consider applying.
She could be out of town. Maybe she'll be gone for months.
All right, you know what? I am not leaving here, until you call that plane back!!
Oh gosh, she's going to kill me.
Nooo!
Good. How are you?
Bye.
Um-hmm.
Really?
Oh my God.
Oh. Oh!
Yeah! Are you kiddin'?
