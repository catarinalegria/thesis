Oh yeah, good start Mon.
Oh honey, thank you, but Mark's taking me out.
I'd wait.
Okay, he's a, he's a black capuchian monkey with a white face... ...with, with Russian dressing and, and pickles on the side. Okay. Thanks.
Ooh, Phoebe's here! Okay, let's turn out all the lights and we'll just watch the movie!
Yes! Rent!
Because I'm married. That's right, I am a married woman! And I came to a TV star's apartment to have an affair! Uck!
Yes, and grumpy.
Oh honey, I'm sorry.
Uh, Joey..
Yes, we do.
Time's up, now your dead.
Oh God. No! Oh not again! This-this happened when my grandfather died. It's ugh! Sorry. Oh, okay, so I'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me?
You still think of it as your apartment, don't you?
Yeah.
So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up, so Ross selflessly, offered to take me.
Oh they're pushing! They're pushing!!
A scooter!
Oh, what do you, you want me to stop seeing him, is that what you want?
What?
Wow.
Oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on you're gonna ruin it!
You know what?
Well, I'm sorry I'm not going to an eye doctor!
You guys, there's a little girl in Soho looking for this cat. I mean, you know what that means?!
Shut up!
Who are you supposed to be?
Daddy.
We?!
Wow.
Oh, okay.
Hi. Sorry, things aren't working out so well.
Hey, Ross!!! I told you I don't!
Oh my God!
Chandler gets it! It's Chandler Bing!
We're good?
Really?!
Okay.
I had one.
Terrible? Hell, I was in Greece! That was a nice hotel! Nice beach, met the nice people. Not to shabby for Rachel.
Good. How are you?
Oh, I read that in high school.
All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!
Oh, I gotta get back to work.
See?
Well I've had it.
Hi.
Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like, everything. And for what?
Well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with Capri pants.
Y'know what? No. It's not over until someone says, "I do."
