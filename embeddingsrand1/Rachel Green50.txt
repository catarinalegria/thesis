Dad, dad. We got it!! We Got It!!!
Oh well, no I...
Oh, okay, we're going. Yeah.
Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing.
Don't call us that!
Uh-huh, yeah I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with you.
Really!?
Great, people having sex, that's just what I need to see.
They're in Vermont!! How could this happen?!
No! Really, no, please, please, that's, that's okay.
Good luck Chandler.
Ok, who ordered what?
Oh, she does want to.
So, I still have boxes here. I still have boxes at Ross's, and I have nowhere to live! Wow. I could so easily freak out right now.
She asked-asked you out again?
You what?
Okay. Wait! Wait!
Yeah, I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass!
May fifth, why?
Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye.
Honey, that's you're name.
Men are unbelievable.
Oh. Oh my God.
Well, hello, Mr. Rachel!
What? They were like this!
Ross, I really don't think...
Oh God.
Yeah, Monica's settin' me up.
Handling it? What do you mean, handling it? There's nothing to handle. Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn't for me and Joshua. Y'know, they're not gonna get married anyway!
Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this.
Wow, he must like you the best.
Say it!
The beef? Yeah, that was weird to me, too. But then, y'know, I thought "well, there's mincemeat pie," I mean that's an English dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, y'know. Oh! by the way, can I borrow some Rum from your place?
NO!
Do you got your gracious loser face?
I don't know. Who would I have to sleep with?
Well and clearly not a minute sooner.
Oh, you know what, we haven't even looked yet.
Oh! Oh, I love that but.
Yeah, my mom got my dad's season tickets in the divorce, so she just gave them to me.
You all know? Does Ross know?
There he is!
Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight. I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding.
Well yeah, I do, but I decided to take a long lunch and spend some time with my friend Monica. Y'know I-I feel that we don't talk anymore. How are you? What is new with you?
You said she was bald!!
Ugh!
Tah-daaah!
Right.
Ohh, yes.
Are you drunk?!
