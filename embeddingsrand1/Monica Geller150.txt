Hello? What?! You what?! Hey you listen here missy! Wh-
You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip's motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.
Umm.
Bye.
We checked. A lot.
You still have feelings for me don't you?
Do you want our guy to be your guy?
Oh, he's sober alright. Just turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason.
Not a lot, Phoebe's kidding, Phoebe's crazy.
Bye!
You didn't find her?
No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff!
Well if you want a problem? I'll give you a problem!
Woo-hoo, stuud!
I'm with you Chandler! I mean I can't have sex with a sick person either, that's disgusting! But I'm not sick! Let me prove it to you. We are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.
Yeah.
Well, apparently she does.
Oh, y'know what, I can't, it really kills.
This is disgusting!
Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. It's My Giant!
So, Phoebe runs weird huh?
Oh, my mom called, they're gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper, so we're looking for a good picture of us.
Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.
A monkey. Have you seen a monkey?
It's beautiful! It's like the first bathroom floor there ever was. Whoa! Are you going in there for?
Well at least, I'm going to mute it.
Because, you were mean to me and you, you teased me and you always, always got your way.
Wait! What about Joey?
So I did tell you. Okay, y'know, that really isn't the thing. Umm, the thing is that, right now I'm just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me. Y'know what I mean?
All right, I've heard enough. I've made my decision.
Pretty much. So, what do you, what do you think of the floor?
That is exactly why I do not lend you stuff!! Okay?! I mean, first it's my jewelry! And if it's not my jewelry, it's-it's my blue sweater! And if it's not my sweater, it's my sunglasses!
Yes, you are so smart!
I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.
Welcome to our side of the tunnel.
Yes? ..yes, she is.
Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!
You're gonna find a place. But even if - God forbid - you didn't.. So you postpone the wedding. Is that really so bad? I mean, think about it. You could take all the time you needed to get everything that you want. You could have tulips, you could have salmon.... Mmmmm... Salmon!!
Now there you go! I wouldn't want my best guest to strain her eyes!
Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion.
So um, who was she?
I think so.
Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High stakes... big bucks...
Oh, good luck.
I-I-I wanna thank you all for coming. My family and my friends...
I know, he's too charming, but if you two start going out, then it's just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him.
I'm sorry..
So, did you play in college? sweatshirt he's wearing.)
'A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green'.
Oh Soap Opera Digest award!
Hey!
Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's.
I'm sorry! It wasn't your whole toe!
Phoebe?
I-I already told him everything! You shush!!
I know, what about Rachel? I mean how are we even gonna ask her?
Yeah you will! And, are you kiddin' me?!
Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana.
She has to know that your not ready.
Joey, you had the night!
Ok, everybody, there's food and drinks on the table. Go across the hall.
Who?
I mean, that's a typical guy response.
No Phoebe, those are like the side affects and stuff.
Chandler.
You sold me out.
That's a good idea.
Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. ... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.
Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.
Okay. Oh! A coloring book!
No, it's more like a good luck.
No! To take more pictures of all of us together. I mean I really think it's the best resolution because everyone will enjoy the pictures.
Okay, guys, listen, don't forget that tomorrow is the day that Emily gets married again, so whatever we do, just try to really keep Ross's mind off of it.
Please tell me it's his mother.
Yeah you're right, we can't-we shouldn't watch this.
Is Joey here?
Really?!
What's to know? Buy sell, high low, bears bulls... Yes Manhattan...yeah telephone number of the stock...selling store.
Okay, wait, you gotta hang up 'cause we're gonna be late.
What?
Hello, Joey.
No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms.
Yeah. In fact, I like her so much you tell her I want my cookies early this year! Y'know, a box of Thin Mints and some Tag-a-Longs.
Oh-oh, no no don't worry, I'm gonna wash it.
You're a really good kisser.
I swear you said you had the keys.
I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. You know, I say we blow off the dates.
Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love! I mean, I get all those presents without having to talk to people I don't even like!
What happened?
Here, take a couple of these.
Because! She's my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! We're family y'know? Well that's important to me.
Once!!
Oh my God, you're a freak.
All right, get your coat, we're going to the hospital.
Joey, promise me something.
Chandler? Can you give me a hand?
Yeah, well you call her and tell her that y'know when we were kids her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadn't have stopped her, there probably wouldn't even be a wedding to go too.
Okay, I got it. Phoebe? All right, you pull. I'm gonna spread the legs as wide as I can. Joey? Now is not the time!
Hey.
Not at these prices.
Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza!
That's a good idea! Wait, do you know how to waiter?
I'm sorry.
He took off?
Umm, if ah, it might be okay if Ross came skiing?
All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move!
How 'bout just a boom?
So, where do you want to go?
'Kay, here you go.
Probably the only time I'll ever say this, but did you see the ass on her?
Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember.
You've been lying to me? I can't believe you'd do that.
Look at you! Come here! Feel better?
I loved them!
Uh-hmm.
Oh, stop beating yourself up! People make mistakes! These things happen! There aren't any message you've forgotten to give me are there? Apparently you're not very good at it! I...
Joey!
I'll get back to my new job.
It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you. And the reason why she couldn't, is because her feelings were so strong, it scared her. Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the plane! Come on now go! Go!
Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?
It's only you.
There were only twelve.
So how does it look?
Come in! Come in! We're engaged!!!
Hey Rach, come on! We're gonna be late for the eye doctor appointment!
That is completely untrue. You think I'm high maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and we're going to go through it point by point!
Okay.
I'm sure they'll be here soon.
So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?
What's the matter?
I bet this will work!
It's almost 8 o'clock, it's almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he?
Why do you need it?
Eldad, this is Rachel.
That didn't work on mom, it's not going to work on us.
That's probably what they'll say.
I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I'm so excited! {And I just can't hide it! I'm about to lose control and I think I like it! Sorry, just couldn't resist it.} All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. Okay? Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral...
Oh good.
No!
I love you, Pete!!!
Oh my God! How cute is the on-call doctor?
I know you're planning my surprise bridal shower.
A-ha!!!
Did you ever, uh, like, think about the future?
"See you around?"
Ya know, my party is fun. I mean, maybe it's a little quieter, less obvious sorta fun but, you know, if people would just give it a chance...
How are you?
Oh God!
OK, try this salmon mousse.
Ok, well, what kind of ritual?
