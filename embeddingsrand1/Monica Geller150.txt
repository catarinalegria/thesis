Dad, I'm the twinkie.
Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!
Come on!
Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing.
I didn't change!
Oh, I'm sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.
We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled 'CUT!'
"Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!"
Yeah, tacos! Ever since you told me that story I've had such a craving for them.
Ross.
Ross!
No-no-no! We need something old!
What the hell happened?!
Excuse me, Mrs. Burkart? Well, we're all cleaned up in the kitchen.
You're kidding!
Oh my God!
I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I'm so excited! {And I just can't hide it! I'm about to lose control and I think I like it! Sorry, just couldn't resist it.} All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. Okay? Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral...
No, I'm wearing a wedding dress.
I don't believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?
Something wrong?
Oh. Why didn't you take her?
Well, I was having a conversation.
Are you crazy?! We own those two! I mean look at 'um, he can't breath and she's popping pills.
You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts, and then to top it off, I lost one of my fake boobs, in a grill fire.
Passport, check! Camera, check! Traveller's cheques, check!
I don't have an atlas.
You're the most wonderful man. And if you hadn't of said 'if I have to' like seventeen times, then I'd be saying 'okay, let's do it.'
Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean, you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you.
Man, man that is sharp. It must have cost you quite a few debloons.
Oh good, I'm glad that's catching on.
I know. How could we have let this happen?
Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk! That they know of.
Hey.
From here to the airport?
Y'know in a weird way, you have too much power. Look, you're gonna have to help me out here, 'cause I only have three.
Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you!
Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit. Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!
Dad, Chandler was just laughing at your joke.
Mmmmm.
This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, y'know she had such a terrible childhood.
Oh God!
What?!
Ow!
Got the keys? or Got the keys!
What am I gonna do?! That is the dress! That is the dress! Wh...Chandler wants the band. What do I do?
"Hi, it's Monica. I'm just checking in 'cause I got this message from you and I didn't know if it was old or new or what. So, I'm just checkin'. So let me know, or don't, whatever. I'm breezy."
Would you please go?
Ross? Let's go.
Ow!! Ow!!
Ross.
Ross!!!
How did you get in here?
Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh? Do you have a dressing room? Do you have a chair with your name on it?
Oh my God yes! Who is she?
Yeah but I'm not keeping it.
Yeah!
Don't say it.
I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?
Well that's the best part. Umm, you guys get to decide!
Hey! Didn't you have that outfit on last night?
Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade of being maid of honor for each other. Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine...
Oh God.
No.
A pill?
Well maybe we can make a, a, a 'B' out of one of those roses.
Really?
What is the worse part?
So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know they're going at it right on the bathroom floor.
Stop it, stop it, stop it!
It's this dumb thing that Ross made up `cause he was trying to fool our parents. It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. I remember I cried the night you made it up, `cause it was the first time that I realized that I was actually cooler than my older brother.
Oh yeah? When?
Hey.
Hey.
What's 'pleh'?
Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you.
Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?
Maye it's me.
Uh, huh. Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away.
Thank you.
What?! Excuse me!
Do you know anything about women?
I love you!
Nooo! Never! I mean, we're living in the moment. God, it is so nice for once to not have to get all hung up on 'Where is this going?'
Okay, I think I get how to do this.
Are you serious?!
Yes!!
No way!
Do you realize that four weeks from today we're getting married? Four weeks baby!! Four weeks!!!
I wanna watch Entertainment Tonight.
Are you sure you wanna do this?
Too strong for me?
I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.
Aww, sweetie, but it's not like you're not gonna have anything. You're gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways that's even better.
Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long.
Yeah.
You need to give him money.
Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, it's time the velvet ropes came down.
Who is it?
All right then.
If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.
Yeah.
What's the matter?
Y'know...go! Go! Right there!
Well, thanks, we like him.
Okay, I'm up! I'm up!
We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?
If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call.
Hey!
Hi!
We'll talk later.
Really?!
So we're back on?
These aren't for you! Are you upset?
I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.
I'm afraid so.
I don't know, maybe. I mean I'm dating a man who's pool I once peed in.
Umm, why don't you give me something that would be a good reason and-and then I'll tell you if it's true.
Okay, Chandler, you go first.
I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.
Y'know what, that's fine, maybe you haven't grown up, but I have.
Rachel?!
Alright, I'll tell you what. I'll come get you in 5 minutes with some sort of um, kabob emergency.
I said that you had a nice butt, it's just not a great butt.
Shoot! We're out of soda.
No.
That counts!
That's okay, this is more important than fruit on my ceiling! You broke up?!
It's not a date, okay. I'm just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.
Wow! And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up.
Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?
Why did they get divorced?
Are you guys gonna be okay?
Okay, but wouldn't it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me.
No. Why?
Y'know dad, Chandler is one of Ross's very best friends!
Why not?
'Cause I don't want to encourage this kind of behaviour.
No, I want everything you just said. I want a marriage.
No Phoebe, those are like the side affects and stuff.
What are you doing here? I thought you had to do inventory all day.
Break!
I am so glad you said cooks.
Oh my God! He just said my name! Did you hear that?
Oh my God! I love him!
Hey, I made $17 before breakfast, what have you done?
Oh wow! Okay. Don't scare me like that okay? I mean for a minute there I was like, "Oh my God! The worst has happened!"
I'm just having one of those days where you realize you're in a dead-end relationship!
Man, this sucks! Y'know if Mom and Dad don't see us on TV after we made them so jealous, I mean, who's gonna be the losers then?
I was in too much pain.
I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, I get off work and I find out that they wrote this on my chef's hat.
