Come here, here, come here, come here, Mrs. Buffay. Sorry, about what I said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you were just a cat. When clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friend's mother.
My God Monica!!
I'm just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y'know? I used them as mittens, I didn't want to touch a thing in that last place.
....and....
Yeah! Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, y'know? Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.
Cannot feel my tounge.
Chloe, Chloe how's it coming?!!
Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole 'Does it?' part just another glance.
Oh come on. It's cold, it's dark, he doesn't know the Village. And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey, and a broken foot! Thank you very much.
Hey guys.
..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he-
Hey!
Turn! Turn!
Thank you, thanks. Yeah, I lost it. Y'know, I'm not gonna play anymore, would you, can you finish my set?
Better not be doin' these in order.
Oh, see from where I was sitting I uh. . .
Please tell me you're joking.
Well you said you couldn't go out so....
Have a good time. Ok, Ben.
Look, you'll get there. You're an amazing chef.
Actually, it looks really good.
Oh my God! Rachel Green?
Fine, I'm mentally unstable.
She's doing her laundry.
There's no 'or' in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!
Oh, oh, you're... uh... you're, oh you're the date.
Well, why don't you just start with something simple. Like umm, Monica from the moment I met you, I knew I loved you.
I'm a professor here uh, Ross...Geller.
Well, as much as I'd like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I aren't going to be here. All right? I mean, she's going to come by first to say good-bye, and then I've got a whole special evening planned. So I'm sorry, no party.
What?
Yeah, she's fired.
Well for starters, you may want to light it and lose the spatula.
No way!
Okay, come on! Daddy needs a new pair of electromagnetic microscopes for the Prehistoric Forensics Department! Okay. Take Pinky Tuscadero up to Inspiration Point, collect three cool points!! Yeah! Which gives me five, and let's see who is gonna lose their clothes. Ummmm, I think I pick our strip poker sponsor Mr. Joey Tribianni.
: OK, I am calling your seventeen. What do you got?
Really? That's great!
Later!
Hey!
Okay.
Everyday I am gonna do one thing that I haven't done before. That my friends is my New Year's resolution.
Dude.
Don't ask me, I had it and I blew it!
Cassie?
It's not a library...
Yeah, they don't like you.
Hi Pheebs!
Y'know what would cheer you up?
Gimme the bottle. Gimme the towel.
Yeah.
What?! Over a stupid room!
Oh-oh really?
Because! Because, it-it-it's... It'd be like you having this guitar and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar wants to be played! And-and this bike wants to be ridden and-and if you don't ride it you-you're-you're killing its spirit! The bike is dying.
Thanks.
My fault?! You threatened the judge!
I-I had to show Chandler something?
The physical act of love.
I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job.
I'll be right down.
Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.
Well? Isn't that amazing?
Okay, okay, I'll go first.
Huh?
It was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back!! Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means 'you are,' Y-O-U-R means 'your!'
You take care Jill.
Hi.
Well, you just...
Try the bottom one.
So I'm gonna take off then!
Oh yeah, yeah, sure. Absolutely.
Yeah? Oh-oh, she'd be so excited!
"Hi Rach, are you there? It's me, pick up. Rachel. Rach!"
Umm, say you're gonna be starving after all this moving. What do you say I take you to dinner tonight?
Okay, that's right, yes, but on Hanukkah, uh, we sing, uh Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked to Emily...
You're my friend. I-I had to tell you.
What is ah, Rach in her room?
Then how do you explain the toe ring?!
Pass it! Pass it!
Scotch. Alright, I'll be back in 10 seconds with your scotch on the rocks in a glass.
I've said it! Okay?! But it's over Joey!
Happy New Year, Pheebs!
Mi-mi-mii.
I'm gonna call after you!
What? What?
G'night.
She wants me to move to London.
What are you doing? Are you trying to hurt me? Or something?
Okay, I gotta go.
Wha... what, here?
I, uh, well... I... I met Russ.
Call me!
Well, apparently not, and I can't just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the silliness!
Oh, I see, so everybody wins.
If like the four of us could all y'know, hang out together. Uh, in fact Emily's coming into town this weekend, why don't you say we all have dinner? Say, Sunday night?
Ohh.
Ehh, I don't, I don't think so. She's already talked about y'know, dating other guys.
Well hello! I'm Ross!
We met at Phoebe's birthday party, I'm, I'm Ross Geller.
Look, I do not re-love her.
You're welcome.
