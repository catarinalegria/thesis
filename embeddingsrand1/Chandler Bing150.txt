Hello!
Bye. I can't stand the woman!
I can't believe the guys missed this.
I'm a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.
What's up?
No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
Well, that's the best kiss I've had with anyone I've ever met in a men's room.
No-no-no-no, this is bad! It's bad! This is bad!
Yeah, I've always hated that Howie.
Yes!
Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.
Hey, does anybody need anything copied? I'm going down to the Xerox place.
No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
Phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies?
How is that worse?!
Hey! What's up?
Well you did pull his hair.
Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because it's romantic, but because I can!
It's not all juice!
Well, I don't see that we have a choice. But, when we're back home, we don't do it.
Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?
I can't believe you got us into trouble.
Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.
Hey, look at this! They're lighting the big Christmas tree tonight.
Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. He didn't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up.
Okay, you guys uh, you guys pick first
Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.
When was the last time you saw her wear it?
So, you don't think I'm terminal?
I don't have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!
If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel.
Volleyball.
Okay.
Y'know, sometimes that fake out thing is just mean!
I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the "new thing you do that day!" And it starts right now!
Wherever! I've got like 20!
Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?
Okay, great.
Which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year.
He's finally happy with that and walks away.
Well, there you are! So what did Elizabeth say?
Can you people not see me?!
So ah, isn't a bit cold out for shorts?
I will have the uh, Cajun catfish.
Out of my league. I could get a Brian. If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. Hey, Brian.
What did you guys just do?!
And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the Netherlands, right?
I don't know. Should we try it?
Could there be more Kims?
Hey, relax I just need more time. We're going to dinner tonight.
There's gonna be a wedding. You're gonna be the bride. Two hundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress.
I've met the perfect woman. OK, we're sitting on her couch, we're fooling around, and then suddenly she turns to me and says, 'Do you ever want to do it in an elevator?'
Yeah, but uh, it was 1982 and my flock of seagulls haircut was tickling her chin.
Well, I didn't do anything. I didn't want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.
Monica said wedding.
OH MY GOD!!!
Weird world. Your kids?
No.
What are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes?
I'll catch you guys later.
Well, somebody should.
And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard.
Na, forget it, it's probably stripped and sold for parts by now.
You burn your mouth?
No, really you're gonna freeze.
Phase Three! I just achieved Phase Three!
Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered.
Okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him anything.
But you found me!
Well, what if all my stuff was here?
Just practicing. You're good. Carry on.
That's me! Come on!
Yes you can. You're thinking about time, you can't go back in time.
Love your condoms my man.
He's the headliner of a gay burlesque show.
You know, I once dated a Miss Crankypants. Lovely girl, kinda moody.
Hey!
You told him to play the boxer gay!!
That guy's going home with a note!
No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!
Okay, a quick one. Come on hug it out. Oh hey! There you go. Okay.
Hey.
Our guy smells incredible.
Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac's sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe's friends with Rachel. And that's the trail, I did it!
Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!
I can't do that.
Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?
What a minute, I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat! They did experiments on me! I can't have children!!
Hey!
Look you have to realize I don't think of you as a thin, beautiful woman. See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is you're Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica.
Y'know I was thinking if we had a...a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours...
Oh, I got some thoughts on that.
I think it's winning.
Really?
Oh good, I was hoping that would come up.
I'm not seeing Monica.
Hey it's Joey!
What? What?
Uh, Yes. Yes. Ive just been going over your data here, and little thing, youve been post-dating your Friday numbers.
Joey, a woman just stuck her tounge down my throat, I'm not even listening to you.
What's going on?
Hey, listen, why don't we go change in my room?
What did you do?
Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her....
It is so good to see you!
You must stop!
I didn't know you were taking a class. That is so cool.
What are you doing?
Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a copier. Look, if there was anything I could do, I would do it. Okay? But everybody's allowed one mistake, right?
Okay.
Ok, there is one more way to say it, who knows it?
Yeah baby!
Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.
Really? Worse than, "More turkey Mr. Chandler?"
Again true.
All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
You-you-you don't wanna give into the fear.
Okay!
Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!
So whaddya got there Monica?
No! No! No! I can't do that!
Why?! What happened?!
I am totally picturing you with all those women!
Heyyyy-What?
Oh, he's in the back. The duck pissed him off, said that eggs came first.
OH...MY...GAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? You didn't tell her we were getting married, did you?
Op, op, I'm convinced!
Hey Rach, now that you're working at Ralph Lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?
Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped.
So are we...friends again?
Phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.
That was amazing!
Yep, I'm in a tree.
Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.
Kids, new dream... I'm in Las Vegas.
Morning, Ross.
What if Joey were president?
Dude, don't do that too me!
What are you talking about?
That was Joey!
Oh, and Ive got Earth Science, but I'll catch you in Gym.
Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?
Get off!
No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they are.
The doctor.
You have done enough!
No reason, except...she...told...me.
I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I doing Ebony and Ivory.
Because it's flattering! Come on Monica! Come on Monica!
You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76. Amouz-bouche?
