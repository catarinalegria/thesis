Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook.
Okay! Here we go. Pillow.
No.
C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit.
Didn't I tell ya? Always showin' off.
Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually didn't get a callback.
Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. All right, when was 1990?
Oh, he was this cab driver we had in London.
Dude, Phoebe's mom has got a huge peni...
Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges.
No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.
Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women.
Yeah, they do! Quit being a baby and leave me alone! There, you've just had your first class!
What kind of smell?
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot, or just fall down. That's good too.
Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.
When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is.
Lean-lean-lean!
: Ahhh, that's alright. Y'know, that's a tough hand to beat.
But I-I-I can't stay too long, I gotta get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow and I gotta look good. I'm supposed to be playing a 19-year-old. What?
Yeah, we're gonna be fine! Get out!
Oh, I'm-I'm not working tomorrow.
No-no-no-no-no, it's-it's uh, you just uh, uh reminded me that uh, I need to do my stretches too.
Well uh, she didn't want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row. I'm so sorry.
Yeah, sure. Well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography.
Yes! Yes! Unreasonable!
How far'd ya get?
Well that thing is clearing in the way! All right. Ah-ha! Ah-ah!! Damn fridge!
Who's Elaine?
Hey!
Whoa! Is this porn? What did I do? I must've hit something on the remote.
Hello.
And a couple of these little tiny boxes.
It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands.
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find...
Somebody wanna help me out here?
All right, I'm gonna go say hi the chick and the duck.
I slept with Monica.
Whatever.
What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?
Oh my God, you guys have no idea.
I'm doing my scenes with you?
No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross see Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!
Your sister stood me up the other night.
We'll be there.
It's not what you said. It's the way you said it....Oh My God, I'm a woman!!!
Okay.
Hey Phoeb's, I think you're good to go.
Over there! Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said "No," you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!
Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do. . . so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, you know that's bad fo r the paper tray.
Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?
What message?
Get out.
Hey guys.
Oh Rachel look, don't say that, I think you just need a hug from Joey. Come on. Come on. She's back! Hot girl's back!
All right! Thanks! You're the best! Now listen, the last day of auditions is Thursday. Okay? So I gotta get in there by Thursday. Okay? Just remember Thursday. Thursday. Can you remember Thursday?
Yeah, all right.
Yes!
She told us.
You're kidding right?
That's not, prison lingo, is it?
Ohh, you know what it is? It's smudgy 'cause they're fax pages. Now when I was on Days of Our Lives as Dr. Drake Remoray, they'd send over the whole script on real paper and everything.
Okay, here's my big scene. My big scene's here! Oh my God.
Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.
What? I have seven Catholic sisters. I've taken care of hundreds of kids. Come on, we wanna do it, don't we?
The Red Ross! Okay.
Boyfriend?
Ross! They're gonna kill you!
C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all.
Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing and it kinda knocked me out a little?
Hey, I was pretty close. Uhh, so bad news. Umm, I can't buy the boat, I don't have any money.
Okay.
Who's birthday party?
Oh no-no-no! No-no-no-no-no-no-no!
Picture? What picture?
But it hurt's my Joey's Apple.
Whoa, wait, Pheebs, wait a second! Don't you wanna stay here and talk about it?
Oh hey uh, be careful with that 3-D last supper, Judas is a little loose.
Had the beef-tips, huh?
Ohh!!
Yeah, you're right. Okay look, listen, let's talk about what a huge star I'm gonna be!
I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.
Yeah, hey hey, Happy Thanksgiving everybody!
All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay? You're hot. I'm lovable. Clearly there's a vibe going on between us. But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.
Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.
That's right! I'm taking the essence.
Erin.
Hey.
I am telling you Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again! Now, is that what you want?
Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project.
She was nothing compared to you.
Okay, I got it! This place makes the best sandwich in the world!
When's that?
What're you doin' here? Aren't you supposed to be out with Rachel?
The green bottle next to the shaving cream.
I guess you wouldn't believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?
Great! Thanks.
Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or- That's fine, yeah...
No. No, I'm Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-I'm the guy in the coma!
I, I don't get you. I mean first, you hate me. Then you sleep with me. Then you want nothing to do with me, now you want me again.
Oh yeah-yeah. And I got the duck totally trained. Watch this. Stare at the wall. Hardly move. Be white.
Why God?! Why are you doing this to us?!
If anything should happen to him...
Re! Re! Then I can watch that! Rewind it! Rewind it!
Excellent.
Hey.
Oh well, it's not on TV yet.
I'm 30!
Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is...
Hey listen, I'm sorry about what happened. . .
That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously? Okay.
Miracle!
What's the matter, Pheebs?
Hey!
Oh.
Sperm or regular?
Oh, you bet I am!
Damnit Carl!
Hey, this is a little extra somethin' for uh, ya know, always bein' there for me.
Yeah, so did I.
Whoa-whoa, what is it?
Well, anyway, I got to go change, I'm ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks.
Can I change a hundred?
You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!
Well, you're amazing.
Thanks sweetheart. Give me a little sugar here. Okay.
Oh noo...
Ahh, you drive safe.
Gotcha. Phoebs, walk with me.
Like the three musketeers, only with fruit.
Great!
No-no-no! No-no wait Rach, you know what would even be more fun? Telling them.
Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday. Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong. Oh, okay, one of you girls come over here and kiss me.
Oh well listen, anyway she's directing the new Al Pacino movie. You gotta get me an audition!
"Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."
Um, this?
Yeah, I can dance, y'know.
Got it! So...
Ohh, then no. Maybe I should hear those specials again.
Hey, Julie, I didn't know you wore lenses.
Thank you. Cha-ching! Oh, well hello Mr. Lincoln. Better luck next time buddy. And the drinks are on me!
Now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya.
Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel.
So, you saw me on Days Of Our Lives huh? Want me to, want me to do a little Dr. Drake Remoray for ya?
Yeah?
They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer?
You can totally tell! Here look, watch me. Smile! Frown. Smile! Frown. Smile!
What? What?
Hey, don't get religious on me, ok. A guy in your position needs to be a little better at relaxing. You know. Why do you think we have the comfortable chairs? Huh...come here...sit down. Ready? Ahh!! Ohh, yeah!! Huh?!
Warm milk and Excedrin P.M.
Aww, man, he took the five of spades!! Oh, no-no-no, here it is!
Oh-ho-ho, yeah! Hey! Y'know what goes good with that?
What are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me?
Oh... Can you imagine if I hadn't left you that last one? You two might've never gotten together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sent that hooker up to the room like I was gonna?! It's like it was in the stars!
All right, all right.
Really? A purse?
Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy. Aramis? Aramis?
What are you doing?
Hey! Mine was by accident! All right, the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel, and kills the dad.
Yeah?
Delicious.
She's not even cold yet!
I'm gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is it's the same day as my niece's christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me. 'Cause my part's just in the beginning I'm not even in the rest of the show-Wedding!
Y'know, I can see why you think that, but ah, actually, you know who I think it is?
Look, what do you want me to say?
I'm so sorry.
No-no, she really is sick!
Sure! Why not?
Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.
Oh sure, go with the sissy.
Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.
Oh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay, maybe I'll talk about London! Y'know when you two hooked up! Only, only I won't say hooked up. I'll say, "Began their beautiful journey..."
What?
All right! Now hey, I need to use the bathroom. Since I don't need any assistance in there, take a break!
Have you kissed her yet? It's awesome! I could do it forever! Y'know what? She-she kisses better than my mom cooks!
When do you think we lost her?
Hey, woah, hey, woah.
Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad....
Phoebs, he's just a little dog. Ahhh.
I'm still on the set!
Yeah? That's so nice!
That's nice.
Okay, may I see the comics?
Yep! Grab a plate.
Yeah.
Audition? I thought you were gonna offer me the part.
All right, so... next time, you take her to your place.
Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.
Yeah, what' going on?
Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania.
Well, it turns out you were right C.H.E.E.S.E.
Well Ahh, yeah! Yeah, sure, a drink sounds great.
Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.
Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Hey Annabelle.
All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
So what if he didn't come! We can still go out and party ourselves!
Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet!
I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you! I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait.
