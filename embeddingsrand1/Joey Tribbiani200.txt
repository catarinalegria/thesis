Don't stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!
Howdy partner!
Hey, stripper!
Hey.
OK, uh.... listen, there's something I want to talk to you about. The network casting lady...
Yeah! We are!
How could this happen to me?! Yesterday I had two TV shows! Today, I got nothin'!
Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.
Supposably. Supposably. Did they go to the zoo? Supposably.
All right, that's it! He cannot do this to Phoebe. This guy is going to get the butt kicking of a lifetime! But, is he a big guy?
Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?
Hey!
I don't wanna give up the bag. I don't have to give up the bag! Do I Rach? Oh, you think I should give up the bag!
Nooo!
He forgot to leave his grip size!
Here we go! Here we go! Here we go! How you doin'?
"Happy birthday to you!"
Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well, when Ross said Rachel at the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here.
Check it out, he's winning! Pete's winning!
You guys don't think I look 19?
I don't want to talk about it. Y'know, you could've at least saved me a whole cookie.
What you do mean?
Oh, uh... don't forget your coupon. .
Ohh, a hunk of sandwich from last year.
Uh, some of her friends, yeah.
We could get that Everest video though.
Man, I'm starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! "Do you want soup or salad?" Both! Always order both!
I just had a glass.
When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is.
I don't know whether it's just 'cause we're breakin' up or... what, but you have never looked so beautiful.
Yeah, and oh she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.
C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!
Good.
Oh, what are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me?
Wow! That was good. That was... Tweezers?
Why is 10 the highest?
Hey, you know about that?!
I need something sweet.
All right, uh, we've got a little bit of a problem here. These people are my friends; you can't treat them that way.
All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today.
Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or- That's fine, yeah...
That's good, just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time.
What?!
I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey.
Oh yeah, I definitely know her.
Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does, ok. If you try to pull somethin', he'll call you on it. 'What're you tryin' to pull,' he'll say.
Yeah, I can dance, y'know.
All right.
Yeah.
OK, listen I've been on sets before, so let me give you a little advice, alright? It's a show, but we're just dancing, OK? It's no big deal. The important thing to remember &#150; stay cool.
What?!
Yeah.
We're the guys.
Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.
I like to see the previews. The candy.
Days Of Our Lives. Anyway, you're not gonna believe it! My character is coming out of his coma!!
So I ah, talked to Lauren, kinda told her how things were with us. Did you ah, did you talk to Marshall?
Huh?
Thanks man.
Come on man, really how old?!
Huh. But still Ross, you're worst day with two women, pretty much better than any other day! Y'know what I mean?
Boy, that guy's underwear sucks!
He hooked up! He hooked up with someone.
No!
Yeah, and I'm a little tired from digging the hole.
Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast. You know, after having slept with her.
Excellent.
Y'know, we don't have to imagine.
Dude, you don't have to brag! We got nothing here!!
Whoa!
You've got to pick a pocket or two. Boyyyyssss, you've got to pick a pocket or two..........
Oh yeah-yeah. And I got the duck totally trained. Watch this. Stare at the wall. Hardly move. Be white.
Yeah, that's what I was afraid of.. Okay, uhh...Look Janine I really want you to feel at home here, but some of this new stuff. It's...too girly.
Yeah. With a bite! Gee-e-e-eez!
That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that?
The allergy guy got the part! Thanks!
Yeah.
I'm back baby! Ha-ha-ha!
Apparently, there's like a million guys out there that can play Mac, and there's only this one robot and this one guy who controls it! I didn't know he could get me fired! What am I going to do?
I know, it was the best I could get out of them.
Hey!
Dude! I am trying to sleep!
Well what is it?!
No! No! I can't! You gotta get me out of it! I've got plans! Important plans!
Freaky.
Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.
Hey!
Oh hey, here Pheebs.
You are? Ross, I'm sorry..
Hey, want a beer? WHOA!!!!
Nope.
Hey.
Good, otherwise my watch would fall off.
Oh my God!
Hey!
....Are we still talking about sex?
Sorry Phoebe.
Yeah, maybe he just cheated on you.
Because, I'm not wearing any underwear now.
I can't hear a word you're saying, my ears are ringing so bad.
Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried!
All right, you got it.
I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone!
Ross, did you really read all these baby books?
That makes more sense.
How you doin'?
Animals dressed as humans.
I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.
Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project.
Yeah.
Well, I-I just, I just it was going to be like a really cool robot, y'know? Like the terminator or uh, when I first saw you.
Okay! We'll need a six-pack of Zima.
Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. So when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes.
Chandler, Chandler, y'know what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses.
Oh, I know how we can decide. Phoebe, show him your game!
Everyday use.
I got it.
Hi!
Yeah! Yeah y'know, like warm up the crowd. Ask 'em where they're from. 'Cause in Joey Tribbiani you get a minister and you get an entertainer. I'm a minis-tainer! There is no one better! There is no one greater!
Yeah, yeah. We went to a Mets game, we got Chinese food, and you know, I love this woman. You have got competition buddy.
All right, here you go buddy. Go nuts.
Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!
Ross? You okay?
They have a kid together, y'know. They're like, they're like a family, and if, I don't know, there's chance they could make that work, I know I wouldn't want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. Are you okay? Do you wanna ah, come poke a nude guy?
Uh yeah, where-where's the guy who decides who's pictures go up on the wall?
You don't think my mom's sexy?
Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.
No-no, things ah, finally happened with Kate.
Oh my God, you're back!
No! I'm up for a Soapie!
All right well, y'know...I guess we know what we have to do to get down.
Y'miss it?
Face to face, yeah!
Hey, you're back!
Your sister stood me up the other night.
Awful! Horrible!
Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what woulda happened.
Wow! I can't believe this! This is incredible. I mean you just won an Oscar!
Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought you'd be out partying with Gandel-worf.
What?!
He's right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that.
No.
Wow! I'm so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much.
Yeah-yeah, it's down to me and two other guys.
Pheebs! Sorry!
Sorry, sorry.
The airport?
Yes! I will have the lobster ravioli.
You know, uh... Chandler got you a gift, too.
Ah.
Well, we're fashioning a very long poking device.
If you want some privacy you can use my hole.
Hey!
What's up man?
No. Really?
Hey, it's me. Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble.
Well then, do it better!
No, look.
She was nothing compared to you.
No-no-no-no-no, it's-it's uh, you just uh, uh reminded me that uh, I need to do my stretches too.
Oh-oh, hey-hey, Kate! Listen I want you to meet everybody. Everybody, this is Kate.
No, that means nothin to me.
Huh, Rach I got to say it's gonna take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude.
Well, I think it went pretty well. I.. I got a callback for Thursday.
Yeah, me too.
I can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'.
Hey! You wanna go?
Hey.
They did it right there on the couch.
You really think he'd take me? I mean, we had a pretty good talk last night but, when I moved out, I hurt him bad.
Yeah, yeah. Hey, why don't you give a pull on that rope?
Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?
Don't you think I asked him that before he got in?!
I think I'm gonna take-off.
I know, and only one layer of jam?! What is up with that?
Well anyway, the guy they wanted backed out and now they want me! I start shooting today!
Hey, you're not Kip!
Is to have a long, long talk. Y'know? Get Joey out on the open road and really open him up.
You see this, this is a friend.
Are you kidding me?! She's gonna this boat!
Kristen?
OK, alright, the people who threw the water.
Hey!!! Oww!! And I'm bleeding.
Hey.
Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?
Stegosaurus!
And-and-and not only that, I'm gettin' a new brain!!
No-no-no-no-no! It's a surprise, but it's gonna be tricky thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.
Heard about the leg burnin' huh?
All right! Now hey, I need to use the bathroom. Since I don't need any assistance in there, take a break!
And you don't a little good about donating the money?
Hey!
Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady.
No! Hey no! This is wrong you guys! Phoebe's our friend! Well, I'm not gonna watch it!
I can hear you!
Okay, I guess it doesn't seem that weird.
But it's $2,000.
Bastard!
Are you kidding me? I never rent a movie without it! Oh. Uh, okay uh let me call you back.
I know I don't have too! It tastes good.
